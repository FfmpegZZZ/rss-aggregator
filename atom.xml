        <content type="html"><![CDATA[【NQNロンドン=蔭山道子】3日の欧州国債市場で、指標銘柄であるドイツ連邦債10年物の利回りは横ばい圏となっている。英国時間16時時点では2.7%ちょうど付近と、前日同時点とほぼ同じ水準で取引されている。
米景気が減速に向かっているとの見方から、ドイツ10年債に買いが増える場面があった。半面、欧州主要600社の株価指数であるストックス600が最高値圏で推移するなど投資家のリスク選好意欲はしぼんでおらず、相対的な安全資産とされる国債相場の上値を抑えている。
米サプライマネジメント協会（ISM）が3日発表した9月の米非製造業（サービス業）景況感指数は8月から低下し、市場予想も下回った。同日に米労働省が発表する予定だった9月の米雇用統計は、米政府機関の一部閉鎖の影響から現時点で発表されていない。　
英国の10年債利回りは小幅に低下（債券価格は上昇）し、英国時間16時時点は4.7%ちょうど付近と前日同時点と比べ0.01%ほど低い水準で推移している。3日発表された9月の英サービス業購買担当者景気指数（PMI）改定値が速報値から下方修正され、英国債の買いを誘った。]]></content>

石破茂首相の後任を決める自民党総裁選が4日、投開票される。5人の候補は1回目の投票でいずれも過半数の票を得られず、上位2人の決選投票に持ち込まれる見通しだ。小泉進次郎農相と高市早苗前経済安全保障相、林芳正官房長官が軸になる。

【関連記事】【LIVE】総裁選、開票直後に生解説　崖っぷち自民の選択は？

政府・与党は15日にも臨時国会を召集し、首相指名選挙を実施する。自民、公明両党は少数与党だが、野党が統一候補を立てる機運は乏しい。自民党の新総裁が首相に選ばれる見通しだ。
日本経済新聞の調査によると、小泉、高市、林の3氏のうち2人が決選投票に進む可能性が高い。小林鷹之元経済安保相と茂木敏充前幹事長は支持が伸び悩んでいる。
総裁選の1回目の投票は国会議員と同数の票を党員・党友に割り振って計590票を争う。決選投票は改めて議員が投票し、47の各都道府県連にも1票ずつ割り振られる。決選に進めなかった候補への票が残った2人のどちらに流れるかが勝敗を左右する。
9月22日告示した総裁選は物価高対策や野党との協力が主な論点になった。自民党は2024年10月の衆院選と25年7月の参院選で敗れ、党の立て直しに向けた改革も問われた。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[自民党総裁選が4日に投開票されます。5人の候補者の主張を分析すると、今後の国の政策の方向性がみえてきます。物価高、外交、コメ、外国人、賃金。日本経済新聞が5つのテーマで掲載した「リーダーの試練」をぜひ参考にしてください。

（1）物価高対策、高市・小泉氏ら「減税」傾斜　現役の社保負担は議論進まず





自民党総裁選の討論会で発言する（左から）小林、茂木、林、高市、小泉の各氏（9月24日、東京都千代田区）
自民党総裁選で物価高対策が焦点になってきた。与党が参院選で掲げた1人2万円の現金給付案に各候補は距離を置き、所得税の減税による負担軽減を意識した主張が目立つ。現役世代では税より社会保険料の負担が重いが、保険料を抑える改革の議論は深まっていない…記事を読む

（2）価値壊す米中2強にどう対峙　日本外交の「自律」議論を





4人の代表的な米大統領の顔を刻んだ米ラシュモア山をモチーフにしたパロディー作品。左からロシアのプーチン大統領、中国の習近平国家主席、北朝鮮の金正恩総書記、トランプ米大統領の顔が並んだ（9月25日、タイ・バンコク）=ロイター
自民党総裁選は国際情勢が激変するなかでのリーダー選びになる。トランプ米大統領は戦後の世界が重視してきた自由貿易体制を壊しにかかる。日本周辺で軍事力を使って現状の秩序を自国優位な形に変えようとする中国、北朝鮮、ロシアが連携を深める。外交のかじ取りを誰に託すかは、世界の秩序や平和の維持を左右する…記事を読む

（3）コメ増産へ道筋を　農家支援制度を整備、海外市場の開拓欠かせず





コシヒカリの稲刈りをするコメ農家（9月23日、埼玉県加須市）
令和のコメ騒動は人口減少によって需要が減るとの予測に基づき生産量を調整する手法の限界を露呈した。気候変動や消費者心理の変化で需要がブレても価格高騰を招かないよう、自民党の新総裁にはコメの増産路線の継続と具体策が求められる。強い農業の実現へ好機を生かす改革が必要だ…記事を読む

（4）外国人政策、総裁選の議論は規制強化に傾斜　成長へ共生策描け





外国人観光客らでにぎわう大阪・道頓堀（2日）
自民党総裁選で外国人政策がテーマに浮上している。7月の参院選でも争点となり、自民党は「違法外国人ゼロ」を公約に掲げた。その公約をベースに総裁候補はいずれも外国人規制を訴える。人手不足で今後も受け入れ増加が見込まれるなか、日本が成長を確保するには、在留外国人との共生策も含めた戦略を描くことが欠かせない…記事を読む

（5）自民党総裁選、賃上げ・成長の実行力競え　新興企業育成は世界に後れ





自民党総裁選では各候補が賃金上昇を訴えているものの、それを裏付ける成長戦略や数値目標は既存政策の枠内にとどまりがちだ。成長の実効性を高めるには技術革新を生み出す規制緩和や新興企業の育成、海外からの投資マネーの呼び込みといった具体策の議論が欠かせない…記事を読む

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[キヤノンのコンパクトデジタルカメラ「IXY」の新機種




キヤノンがコンパクトデジタルカメラ「IXY」シリーズの新機種を10月下旬に発売する。同シリーズでは9年ぶりの新製品だ。スマートフォンに押されていたコンデジ市場が復調してきたのに合わせ、増産できるよう設計を見直した。富士フイルムやリコーイメージングも新製品を投入し、カメラ撮影を「体験」として楽しみたい若年層の需要を取り込む。
10月下旬から新機種「IXY650m」を発売する。オープン価格だが、キヤノンの公式通販サイトで5万5000円で売り出す。16年5月に発売した前機種「IXY650」は24年4月以降は公式通販で4万2900円で販売していたが、需要に生産が追いつかず購入ができなくなっていた。
新製品の重さはバッテリーとメモリーカードを含んでも146グラムと軽量だ。ポケットに収まるサイズ感で持ち運びもしやすい。広角から望遠まで対応する光学12倍ズームレンズを備え、1台で人物や風景など、幅広い撮影シーンに対応できる。
ただしこうした基本性能は、旧機種「IXY650」をほぼ踏襲している。対応する記録媒体が従来のSDカードからマイクロSDカードに変わったが、それ以外に機能面では大きな変化はない。








なぜいま9年前とほぼ同じスペックの新機種を投入するのか。背景には、旺盛な若年層の需要がある。業界団体のカメラ映像機器工業会（CIPA）によれば、24年のコンデジを中心とする「レンズ一体型カメラ」の出荷台数は前年比9%増の188万台と下げ止まった。25年1〜7月期は22%増の128万台と、復調の勢いが加速している。
キヤノンの旧機種の需要も高まっていたが、コンデジ市場がピーク時から大きく縮小したことで、生産に必要な部品の一部が市場で枯渇してしまっていた。量産対応がとれず、顧客の元に届きにくい状況になるなど、機会損失が生じていた。
新製品は内部の設計を刷新することで、量産対応がとれるようにした。新製品の商品規格を担当したキヤノンのイメージング事業本部の山田悠太氏は「20代前半など小さい時からスマホに慣れ親しんだ世代は、デジタルカメラでの撮影を新鮮な体験と感じている」と話し、若年層の囲い込みに意欲を示す。
16年に旧機種を発売した当時は子供を撮影したいファミリー層が主な顧客だった。スマホ普及で最も打撃を受けたコンデジだが、消費者の価値観の変化を受けて新たな需要が生まれている。
キヤノンはコンデジで新製品を相次ぎ投入している。4月には本格的な動画撮影ができるコンデジ「パワーショット　V1」を発売した。日常の様子を撮影して投稿する「Vlog（ブイログ）」の撮影や、SNS（交流サイト）上で動画配信を楽しむ人の需要を取り込む。




富士フイルムのコンパクトデジタルカメラ「エックスハーフ」

競合も黙ってはいない。富士フイルムも6月に、デジカメでは珍しい縦構図の写真が撮れるコンデジ「エックスハーフ」を投入した。専用のスマホアプリとの連携機能も備え、カメラに興味を持ち始めた初心者層の需要を狙う。リコー傘下のリコーイメージングも、スナップ写真に特化したコンデジ「GRシリーズ」の新製品を9月に発売している。




リコーイメージングのコンパクトデジタルカメラ「リコー ジーアール フォー」

プロ向けの高級コンデジを投入する例もある。ソニーグループ傘下のソニーは、8月に価格が60万円を超えるコンデジの最上位機種を発売した。プロカメラマンが日常風景の撮影などで表現の幅を広げるために使うことを想定している。
一時は崖っぷちに立たされたコンデジだが、若年層の需要を受けて競争が激化している。スマホの画質向上も続くなか、カメラメーカー各社は引き続き差別化に向けて知恵を絞ることが求められている。（山田航平）

The Senate on Friday is poised to vote once again on dueling funding bills that would end the three-day-old government shutdown before it stretches into next week.
But there is little indication that either Republicans' "clean" resolution, which would resume funding at current levels through late November, or Democrats' version, which includes additional health-care funding and other measures, will pass.

The same competing resolutions have already failed multiple times in the Senate, including on the eve of the shutdown and after it began Wednesday morning.
If they fail again, the chamber is expected to adjourn for the weekend.
The Senate is expected to convene for votes starting at 1:30 p.m. ET.

Both parties' leaders so far have shown more interest in convincing Americans that the other is to blame for the impasse than in working out a compromise.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Friday accused his Democratic opponents of being cowed by the far left of their party into obstructing President Donald Trump's agenda.

"It's all about President Trump and the Democrats needing to pick a fight to satisfy their far left political base, far left activist organizations who are the tail wagging the dog right now," Thune said. "That's all this is about."
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said earlier on MSNBC that the president bears responsibility.
Trump "is in the presidential witness protection program — no one can find him when it comes to the government shutdown issue, because he knows he's responsible for having caused it," Jeffries said.
Meanwhile, the funding lapse is expected to lead to the furlough of an estimated 750,000 federal employees and trigger the temporary closure of a slew of government programs and offices.
The Trump administration, which was already working to shrink the size of the government, is warning that the shutdown could lead to permanent layoffs of thousands of federal workers — despite that not happening during prior funding lapses.

Trump said Thursday that Democrats gave him an "unprecedented opportunity" to cut what he described as "Democrat Agencies."
While it was unclear precisely what that meant, Trump's warning came a day after his administration froze $18 billion in Department of Transportation funds for two big infrastructure projects in New York City, and said the Department of Energy had cancelled nearly $8 billion in climate-related projects and other initiatives in 16 states that Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election.
On Friday morning, the DOT froze another $2.1 billion in federal funds allocated for Chicago's transit system.

Bitcoin rallied on Friday to within striking distance of its record high as the U.S. government's shutdown entered its third day.
The world's oldest cryptocurrency is trading up roughly 2% on the day at $123,874. That's about 1% below its all-time high price of just north of $124,000 that it reached in mid-August.

Investors are flocking to the decentralized asset after U.S. lawmakers failed to strike a deal on federal funding, forcing the U.S. government to shutdown on Wednesday. Bitcoin is up 12% this week alone.
"The shutdown matters this time around," wrote Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick. "During the previous Trump shutdown (22 Dec 2018 to 25 Jan 2019) Bitcoin was in a different place than now, so it did little." 
"However, this year bitcoin has traded with 'US government risks' as best shown by its relationship to US treasury term premium," added Kendrick.
Standard Chartered expects a new high soon and ultimately the crypto hitting $135,000 after that.

【ヒューストン=大平祐嗣】米ボーイングが2026年の就航を目指す次期大型機「777X」の納入が27年にずれ込むことが3日、わかった。米ブルームバーグ通信が報じた。ボーイングには遅れにより数十億ドルの費用を計上する可能性がある。
ボーイングは777Xを主力機「777」シリーズの新型として13年から開発を進めてきた。当初は20年の就航を目指していたが、小型機の墜落事故や新型コロナウイルスによる航空機需要の低迷などを受けて開発が遅れていた。直近では26年に納入すると説明していた。
777Xの最初の納入先となる独ルフトハンザ航空は27年まで同機の保有を計画していないという。
オルトバーグ最高経営責任者（CEO）は9月には777Xの開発について「新たな技術課題は発生していない」と話した。米連邦航空局（FAA）からの認証取得のための「作業が山積している」と述べ、遅れが生じるかどうかを確認中だとしていた。
ブルームバーグによると、遅れにより25億〜40億ドルの費用がかかるとの見方がある。ボーイングは12四半期連続で赤字が続いており、費用の増加で経営再建により時間を要する可能性がある。

Since Roe v. Wade was overturned, the number of abortion clinics there has doubled. With strong protections for gender-affirming treatment, and now universal child care, the state is betting on a progressive vision.

In May, 2022, when Politico published a leaked draft of the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, presaging the overturning of Roe v. Wade, Andrea Gallegos realized that she would probably have to move. Gallegos and her father ran Alamo Women’s Reproductive Services, an abortion clinic in San Antonio, and Texas had a trigger law on the books which would ban abortion if Roe was overturned. When Gallegos and her father considered where they would be most useful, Albuquerque, New Mexico, kept coming up. “It seemed like a place where we could still help Texans, and of course we knew the political climate in New Mexico would be friendly,” she said. The Dobbs decision was announced publicly in June; Alamo’s Albuquerque clinic opened in August. (Later that year, Gallegos and her father also opened a clinic in southern Illinois.)
New Mexico shares a border with Texas, but the experience of providing abortion care in the two states was “vastly different,” Gallegos told me. “It took awhile to adjust.” In Texas, legislators had always seemed to be enacting new regulations aimed at making the clinic’s work more difficult. “There were so many loopholes and unnecessary things that we had to overcome, that our patients had to overcome,” Gallegos said: a mandatory twenty-four-hour waiting period; a requirement that patients had to view ultrasound images; a statement that providers had to read to patients which referred to the fetus as an “unborn baby.” None of that was the case in New Mexico. Even the protesters were less alarming. “What we were used to experiencing was more aggressive, with Texas’s open-carry laws,” Gallegos said. “A lot of our protesters made it known that they were carrying guns with them while they stood outside our clinic. In New Mexico and in Illinois, it’s not allowed, so we don’t see that.” Being treated like “a legitimate health-care clinic” was a “huge change,” she said. “Many times my dad has said that it’s nice that we can just do what we need to do to take care of patients—he can just be a doctor and not have to worry about calling an attorney over something ridiculous.”




In recent years, New Mexico has quietly emerged as a progressive health-care sanctuary in the Southwest. Since the Dobbs decision, the number of abortion clinics in New Mexico has more than doubled, as clinics that were forced to close their doors elsewhere have reopened in the state, which has no gestational limits on abortion. More than ten thousand women have travelled there to receive abortion care. New Mexico is “taking on the burden for women who don’t have these protections in places like Texas and Oklahoma and Nevada and Utah,” Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham told me. The state also has among the strongest protections in the Southwest for gender-affirming care for both adults and minors. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance limiting the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine to certain populations, New Mexico’s Department of Health promptly ordered pharmacies to make the vaccine available to anyone who wanted it. This November, New Mexico will become the first state to offer universal free child care to all residents, regardless of income—an initiative that Lujan Grisham has spoken about as being part of a broader attempt to improve the health of New Mexicans.


New Mexico is one of the poorest states in the country; it also ranks near the bottom in terms of health outcomes. It’s banking on the idea that improving access to abortion, as well as other progressive health-care priorities, will help not only out-of-state patients but residents as well. “New Mexicans always think of their state as last, and I don’t know why that is,” Lujan Grisham told me. “These are huge announcements. There’s a lot we can do better, but New Mexico is on the forefront in a lot of ways.”
Abortion was effectively outlawed in New Mexico in 1969. But, years before Dobbs, a group of activists calling themselves the Respect New Mexico Women campaign began petitioning lawmakers to overturn the ban. As part of the initiative, a coalition surveyed New Mexico voters on their opinions about abortion. “The prevailing cultural attitude was, I may not believe in abortion, but I trust people to make the best decisions for themselves and their families,” Eve Espey, the former medical director of the University of New Mexico’s Center for Reproductive Health and the former chair of the U.N.M. medical school’s ob-gyn department, told me. (Espey was a participant in the coalition.) “We’re purplish, but we’re more blue relative to abortion care.”
There was a “strategic, well-executed plan,” according to Deborah McFarlane, a professor of political science at U.N.M. and a co-author of “Regulating Abortion: The Politics of US Abortion Policy.” “They primaried out Democrats who weren’t progressive enough to change state law,” she said. The ban was overturned in 2021. In 2023, the state legislature passed House Bill 7, which enshrined the right to abortion and gender-affirming care in state law.
Espey, who attended medical school in California, moved to New Mexico in the early nineties, to work for Gallup Indian Medical Center. She found that, though people in the state were broadly tolerant of abortion rights, access was another matter. The state’s only consistent abortion clinics were in Albuquerque; access to reproductive care, and to health care in general, was a struggle. “Reproductive-health outcomes across the spectrum of pregnancy are worse than in many areas of the country,” Espey said.





When I spoke with Espey over the phone, she was on her way to Las Cruces, just a few miles from the state’s border with Texas, to care for patients at the Planned Parenthood clinic there. As demand from out-of-state patients increased, she said, clinics have opened throughout the state. “Even in Gallup, which is a much more conservative town, some very brave providers there are now providing abortion care.” Between 2020 and 2023, the number of abortions performed in the state increased by more than two hundred and fifty per cent, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which advocates for sexual and reproductive health. Most patients were from out of state, the majority of them Texans. As Texas has sought to access patients’ medical records in other states, New Mexico passed a shield law that protects such information.
New Mexico’s strong stance on abortion may seem surprising since it is more rural and more religious than much of the country. “New Mexico’s the West, not the South,” McFarlane said. “It might be religious, but it’s not as evangelical as some other states.” She also pointed out that more than half of the members of the state legislature are women, making the state second only to Nevada in terms of female representation. Lujan Grisham said she believes that the state’s high rates of poverty contribute to general support for abortion. “When you have access-to-health-care problems, as we do, it is not lost on any New Mexican how risky taking away our fundamental reproductive rights are,” she said. “And when you’re a particularly poor state, that can be much more pronounced.”

Lujan Grisham, who was elected governor in 2018, after serving a stint in the House of Representatives, has made abortion advocacy a key focus of her political career. “I was the first congressional candidate, I believe, to run on abortion care, and to use the term. Yes, it’s choice, and it’s reproductive rights, but I’m going to protect a woman’s access to and right to an abortion,” she told me. “I got a lot of pushback from a lot of folks, but, in fact, it’s why I won the election.” New Mexico allows the governor a certain amount of discretionary funding that can be spent on projects that require significant capital outlay. Lujan Grisham has allocated twenty million dollars to build reproductive-health clinics, one currently under construction in Las Cruces and another planned for northern New Mexico. “I want more abortion and abortion care available where people are, and I want more primary-care access for women and their families,” Lujan Grisham said.
Espey, who will help get the Las Cruces clinic up and running, said that it will provide “care across the women’s reproductive-health spectrum,” including contraception, basic fertility treatments, doula services, menopause care, and abortion, as well as basic primary care, immunizations, and cancer screenings. Though the clinic is intended for New Mexicans, Espey expects that many Texans will be treated there, too. Treating out-of-state patients will help with the clinic’s financial viability, Lujan Grisham told me. “They’re paying for the full cost of their care, and that’s helpful,” she said. “They can help offset losses from New Mexicans who have no coverage, or who are on Medicaid.”
Lujan Grisham is also hoping that the state’s embrace of abortion care will help attract more doctors and address the state’s long-standing shortage of health-care workers. Last year, New Mexico took out full-page ads in five Texas newspapers, urging medical professionals to relocate. “I certainly respect those of you who remain committed to caring for patients in Texas, but I also invite those of you who can no longer tolerate these restrictions to consider practicing next door in New Mexico,” the ad, framed as an open letter signed by Lujan Grisham, said. “We’re fiercely committed to protecting medical freedoms here and we’re taking steps to ensure that what happened in Texas never happens in New Mexico.”
The state’s embrace of abortion has met with some backlash. Anti-abortion groups have paid for billboards near the Texas-New Mexico border, urging women travelling for abortions to turn back. An organization called Stop the Clinic has been attempting to prevent the Las Cruces center from being built, in part by urging local companies to refuse to work on the project.
Some of the fiercest battles have taken place in the oil-field towns of eastern New Mexico, the most conservative part of the state. (In Lea County, in the southeast corner of the state, Donald Trump won eighty per cent of the vote last year.) In 2023, Laura Wight, a co-founder of Eastern New Mexico Rising, a local progressive group, spotted a flyer advertising the Texas anti-abortion activist Mark Lee Dickson’s appearance at a church in Clovis, near the Texas border. Dickson has spent the past decade urging cities and counties, mostly in Texas, to declare themselves “sanctuary cities for the unborn.” After his church appearance, Dickson spoke before the city council, urging Clovis to join the ranks of sanctuary cities. “We don’t have a clinic here. We’ve never had a clinic here,” Wight told me. Still, she saw Dickson’s lobbying as a “five-alarm fire.” In Texas, Dickson’s efforts had initially seemed symbolic—most of the self-anointed sanctuary cities were places that had never had an abortion clinic—but they eventually became part of a novel legal strategy that resulted in the state’s “bounty hunter” abortion bill, which allows private citizens to sue abortion providers.





The sanctuary-city bill that Clovis ultimately passed cited the Comstock Act, the nineteenth-century obscenity law that some anti-abortion activists are hoping to leverage into a national abortion ban. “Those sanctuary-city folks were, like, Well, we can access eastern New Mexico because it’s red,” Taylor McCoy-McCabe, a member of Eastern New Mexico Rising, added.
Wight rallied groups to speak against the sanctuary-city proposal. The city-council meetings were “horrible,” Wight said; a local pastor posted Wight’s name and work information online and urged people to call her employer to demand that she be fired. “It very much felt like we were fighting the fight on our own,” Wight said. “The folks in Albuquerque and Santa Fe were shocked, because they just assumed that everybody’s safe in New Mexico.” Although the Clovis council initially voted to table the bill, they eventually passed it, and similar sanctuary designations were enacted across much of eastern New Mexico, including in Hobbs, Eunice, and Edgewood, as well as in Roosevelt and Lea Counties. Dickson and his frequent collaborator, the former Texas solicitor general Jonathan Mitchell, were outspoken about their plans to use the New Mexico ordinances as a stepping stone to get the expansion of the Comstock law ratified before the Supreme Court.
In 2023, however, New Mexico’s attorney general, Raúl Torrez, sued to block the sanctuary-city declarations, arguing that H.B. 7 preëmpted the local ordinances. A year later, the state Supreme Court unanimously agreed, and avoided ruling on the Comstock issue, which makes it unlikely that the ruling will be used to force a national showdown.
Before moving to eastern New Mexico, McCoy-McCabe lived in a small town in Indiana. That community was just as conservative as Clovis, but it felt “completely different,” she said. “Here, maybe the city and the county want to do things that are very Republican-leaning, but they can’t. The state is protecting us.”
Even so, both McCoy-McCabe and Wight told me that they were taking a step back from public activism for personal reasons. Instead, they’ve been engaged in smaller-scale projects: organizing a gender-neutral clothing swap; pooling money to help a single mother from South Texas travel to Albuquerque for an abortion. “It’s just a scary time for everybody,” Wight said. “We’re just trying to take care of each other, you know? Support your neighbors, support your community, taking care of ourselves. You do what you can when you can. I think everybody’s struggling with how best to do that.” ♦]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Every weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a "Morning Meeting" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Friday 's key moments. 1. Stocks rose Friday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting a fresh record high despite the U.S. government shutdown, which delayed today's release of the important monthly jobs report. "What's happening is that we didn't have the labor report, so a lot of people are trading blind," Jim Cramer said. Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis, added that the broad-based S & P 500 has been in the green every day this week, proof that the market is ignoring the DC drama. "It's not as big a risk as people think it is," Marks said. 2. Boeing shares are higher on Friday, even as Bloomberg reported late last night that the company's 777X model is expected to fly commercially in 2027 instead of 2026. According to Bloomberg, the setback could lead to billions of dollars in accounting charges. "Don't take any action on this. It's not an actionable call," Jim said, noting that the news isn't a surprise. Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said last month at a conference that the program was behind schedule. The jet maker reports earnings at the end of the month. 3. Nike , the Club's newest stock, was upgraded to a buy-equivalent rating at Keybanc Wednesday, following a better-than-expected earnings report Tuesday. Analysts said that there is "increasing evidence of a turnaround materializing." But its business in China is "awful," said Jim. Nike CEO Elliott Hill plans to speak with CNBC's Sara Eisen on Monday. "If he can say anything about coming back in China, the stock will shoot up," Jim said. Otherwise, "it will be a non-event." 4. Stocks covered in Friday's rapid fire at the end of the video were: PayPal, Johnson and Johnson, and Applied Materials . (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long BA, NKE.

President Putin has responded to Donald Trump’s claim that Russia is a “paper tiger,” saying “this paper tiger” is successfully fighting “the entire NATO bloc” in Ukraine. Let’s break things down with help from one of Russia's top military experts.



In his speech at Valdai Thursday, Putin pointed out:



that in September alone, Ukraine lost 44.7k troops (nearly half irretrievable)

from January-August, 150k servicemen deserted (compared to 160k mobilized)

Ukraine’s reserve pool is dwindling



NATO Equipment Turned to Scrap

Ukraine’s losses, per the latest Russian MoD figures, include:



43.1k+ military vehicles

30.1k artillery & mortars

nearly 1.6k MLRS

25.3k tanks & armored vehicles

Over 630 air defense systems

More than 280 helicopters & nearly 670 planes

87.7k drones



Whole NATO-Trained Armies Disappearing

Ukraine has lost the equivalent of 14 combined arms armies with 100k troops each, says veteran Russian military analyst Alexei Leonkov.


That’s 3 more than the 11 in Russia’s Armed Forces, and despite a traditional 4-1 loss ratio of advancing vs defending forces, Leonkov explained.



Hybrid Economic War Failing

Russia achieved this “under harsh economic sanctions and external political pressure,” Leonkov stressed.

The country partially mobilized and organized a war economy to adapt to NATO’s goal of turning the Ukraine crisis into a long, drawn-out conflict.


Russian Strategic Expansion Continuing

In spite of Ukraine, Russia has continued to grow its strategic potential, including the modernization of its nuclear triad and air and missile defense technologies and capabilities.

New hypersonic systems can be expected, Putin says.


Weapons Testing Ground Wrecked

NATO wanted to turn Ukraine into a test case of a new modern, integrated air defense system.

Instead, Russia smashed this system to the point where there’s a shortage of air defense assets not only in Ukraine, but the alliance as a whole.


Wunderwaffe Repulsed

NATO deployed Storm Shadow, HIMARs, ATACMS and other long-range strike systems to try to change the course of the conflict.

Russia exhausted these weapons, and demonstrated a first-in-the-world next-gen hypersonic weapon in battle with its Oreshnik.


Drone Plans Disrupted

In 2024, after running out of manned aircraft to send, NATO turned its hopes to drones.

Instead, Russia ironed out production of its own UAVs, and began to develop new kinds, like fiber-optic FPV drones and Lancet loitering munitions working in concert.


Paper Eagle


NATO, not Russia, is the real paper tiger, “believing they’re all powerful but actually proving weak,” Leonkov says.






Instead of preparing for conflicts against strategic peers, the US spent decades fighting colonial wars against weak foes.

Ukraine is the result.]]></content>

Stocks rose to record highs Friday as Wall Street headed for solid weekly gains even with a U.S. government shutdown dragging on.
The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average traded higher by 519 points, or 1.1%. The S&P 500 advanced 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 popped 1.5%. All four benchmarks hit all-time highs.
With Friday's gains, the three leading indexes are pacing for a positive weekly finish. The broad market S&P 500 has risen more than 1% week to date, along with the 30-stock Dow, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up nearly 2% in the period. The Russell has jumped 2.5%.
The government shutdown entered its third day Friday, and while it has exacerbated underlying concerns this year about macroeconomic and policy headwinds, inflation risks and a slowing labor market, investors expect it to be short-lived, thereby limiting potential hits to the U.S. economy. Those on Wall Street also believe that the shutdown won't stop the momentum in the artificial intelligence trade. Shutdowns have not been market-moving events in the past.
The shutdown has led to an economic data blackout, and the Labor Department's pause on virtually all activity has blocked the Friday release of the September nonfarm payrolls report. While that removes a factor that could lend pressure to stocks, it lessens the amount of economic data the Federal Reserve can factor into its interest rate decision at its October meeting. Markets largely expect the central bank will lower rates by a quarter percentage point then, per the CME FedWatch tool.
Stoking ongoing concerns about the jobs market, President Donald Trump has threatened massive layoffs and said Thursday the Democrats have given him an "unprecedented opportunity" to cut federal agencies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also told CNBC Thursday that the current lapse in federal funding could lead to "a hit to the GDP, a hit to growth and a hit to working America." The Congressional Budget Office estimates 750,000 federal workers will be furloughed each day.
"We view September's mixed, private-sourced substitutes for the Labor Department's delayed jobs report as soft enough to justify another interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve at the October 29 FOMC meeting," said Jennifer Timmerman, senior investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "Prospects for further rate cutting by the Fed, reinforced by the yellow flag for the economy raised by the latest jobs data, has cemented a rally in stocks and left the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note low enough, at 4.11%, to lift the S&P 500 to a fresh all-time high."
Earlier this week, September's private payrolls data saw their biggest decline since March 2023, according to ADP, yet another sign the labor market is weakening.

Individual investor bullishness hits three-month high in latest AAII survey

More individual investors said they are bullish about the short-term outlook for stocks in the latest weekly poll by the American Association of Individual Investors than at any time since the first week of July, rising to 42.9% from 41.7% last week and a recent, early-September low of 28.0%.
Investors who are bearish about the outlook for stocks over the next six months were unchanged at 39.2%, and those who said they are neutral on the market outlook fell to 17.9% from 19.1% last week and a recent high of almost 30% in early June.
Main street investor sentiment is often used as a contrarian indicator, with rising bullishness sometimes signaling an exhaustion of buying power out of a belief that most purchases have already been made, leaving less cash on the sidelines to put to work in the market.
In a special question this week, more than half of those surveyed (55.6%) by AAII said they didn't own gold or other precious metals directly or through an exchange-trade fund. Fewer than one in five (18.7%) said they did, while roughly 16% said they owned both precious metals and mining companies, nearly 8% said they only own miners only and not the metals, and less than 2% said they were considering adding gold to their portfolios.

Service sector activity fell more unexpectedly fell in September 

Service sector activity in the U.S. stalled in September amid a slowdown in production to its lowest level since the early months of the Covid pandemic.
The ISM services PMI registered a 50.0% reading for the month, down 2 percentage points from August and below the Dow Jones consensus estimate for an unchanged level of 52%. The various purchase manager surveys reflect the percentage of companies reporting growth, so anything less than 50 is contraction.
Within the survey, the business activity and production index dropped to 49.9, a decrease of 5.1 points. Though just below the line, the slip into contraction is the first since May 2020, just two months after the pandemic was officially declared.
Elsewhere, the employment index nudged higher to a still-contractionary 47.2 while the prices index also was edged up to 69.4. Order backlogs posted a strong 6.9-point gain to 47.3 while new orders and inventories both fell by more than 5 points.

Chicago Fed President Goolsbee says he's ‘a little wary’ about cutting rates too quickly




Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee speaks to the Economic Club of New York in New York City, U.S., April 10, 2025.
Brendan McDermid | Reuters


Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said Friday he's leery of cutting interest rates too quickly as threats increase both inflation and employment.
In a "Squawk Box" interview on CNBC, the central banker indicated that pressure is coming to both sides of the Fed's so-called dual mandate of stable prices and low unemployment.
"This uptick of inflation that we've been seeing, coupled with the payroll jobs numbers deteriorating, have put the central bank in a bit of a sticky spot where you're getting deterioration of both sides of the mandate at the same time," Goolsbee said. "I'm a little wary about front-loading too many rate cuts and just counting on the inflation going away."

Goldman CEO David Solomon warns of market 'drawdown,' says 'people won’t feel good'

Stock markets are due a "drawdown" in the next year or two after years of being propelled to record highs by an AI frenzy, according to Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.
"Markets run in cycles, and whenever we've historically had a significant acceleration in a new technology that creates a lot of capital formation, and therefore lots of interesting new companies around it, you generally see the market run ahead of the potential ... there are going to be winners and losers," he said at Italian Tech Week in Turin, Italy, on Friday.
Solomon pointed to the mass adoption of the internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which led to the emergence of some of the world's largest companies — but also saw investors lose money to what became known as the "dotcom bubble."
"You're going to see a similar phenomenon here," he said. "I wouldn't be surprised if in the next 12 to 24 months, we see a drawdown with respect to equity markets ... I think that there will be a lot of capital that's deployed that will turn out to not deliver returns, and when that happens, people won't feel good."

Johnson and Johnson is a buy as executives project strong medicine sales over the next two years and as the company expands its drug-making operations in the U.S., according to Wells Fargo.
The bank upgraded the pharma giant to overweight from equal weight. It also raised its price target for shares to $212 from $170, implying about 14% upside.
"Given the potential upside to JNJ's Pharma business, lower Pharma tariff and pricing risk, and investor confidence that JNJ can grow through the Stelara LOE, we could see JNJ's valuation move higher," analyst Larry Biegelsen said Friday in a note to clients.

With a Georgetown University degree and several internships under her belt, Christina Salvadore thought she'd be starting a career in New York City's fashion or beauty industries around now. The problem: She can't find a job.
The 23-year-old hasn't been able to land a full-time role despite filling out hundreds of applications and taking dozens of networking calls since graduating in the spring. She's currently applying to part-time gigs to tide her over financially.
"It definitely sucks when people are like, 'So what are you doing now?,'" Salvadore, a Florida native, told CNBC. "I'm sitting in my parents' house on LinkedIn 24 hours a day."
A growing body of data shows Salvadore isn't alone. Young college grads are having a uniquely difficult time trying to clinch their first full-time jobs and feeling the brunt of the weakening labor market.

The firm initiated coverage of the Italian supercar maker with a buy rating, noting "there is significant investor interest, which is starting to coalesce with our view on the group's 2026 price/mix, although there were mixed but high capital markets day (CMD) expectations. Many investors now accept that Ferrari is a high-quality compounder. Several expressed regret about staying on the sidelines, while a small minority raised concerns about residual values."

The shutdown of the federal government is likely to worsen the delays student loan borrowers are already facing in accessing programs required by Congress and mandated in their loan terms.
More than 1 million borrowers are in a backlog to enroll in an income-driven repayment plan, according to court records from mid-September.

During the shutdown, Federal Student Aid staff "will not be able to perform regular operations, including working on the IDR backlog," a spokesperson for the Education Department told CNBC on Wednesday. That day, the U.S. government shut down after lawmakers failed to reach a funding deal, meaning that most of the federal workers at the Education Department would be temporarily put on unpaid leave.
"Even before the shutdown, borrowers were at a breaking point," said Michele Zampini, associate vice president of federal policy and advocacy at The Institute for College Access & Success.
"Now, with application processing reportedly at a standstill, borrowers will continue to face unaffordable payments."

Congress created the first IDR plans in the 1990s to make student loan borrowers' bills more affordable. Historically, the plans cap people's monthly payments at a share of their discretionary income and cancel any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years.

Here's what student loan borrowers need to know about getting into a new repayment plan right now.

Delays are 'disruptive to the lives of borrowers'

As of Aug. 31, there were already 1,076,266 income-driven repayment plan applications pending with the agency, court records show.
"It is not surprising that there will be no progress on the IDR backlog during the shutdown, as the staff who work on it aren't considered 'essential,'" said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.
But, Kantrowitz said, "the failure to clear the backlog is disruptive to the lives of borrowers."


Many of the borrowers in the backlog are likely trying to switch out of the Biden administration-era SAVE, or Saving on a Valuable Education, plan. A court struck that program down in February and now borrowers who remain in the SAVE forbearance, which borrowers were placed into during the legal challenges, are seeing interest grow on their debt. (The Trump administration started charging interest as of Aug. 1.)
"Interest has been accruing on their loans, but they have been unable to switch to another plan," Kantrowitz said.
In the meantime, borrowers stuck in the backlog may not be making progress toward loan forgiveness, either under the terms of an IDR plan or through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. PSLF offers debt cancellation to certain public servants or non-profit workers after a decade.

What borrowers in the backlog can do

For now, the best move student loan borrowers stuck in the backlog can do is to salt away the money they would have directed to their payments, Kantrowitz said. That way, you'll have plenty of cash to draw on when the Education Department switches you into another IDR plan and your first bill comes due.




This remains a waiting game.


Carolina Rodriguez
director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program



While this waiting period likely doesn't count toward IDR or PSLF forgiveness, when you first applied for an IDR plan, you were supposed to be put into a 60-day administrative forbearance at first, and those two months still do count on your forgiveness timeline, Kantrowitz said.
"Our advice to borrowers is to maintain thorough records and monitor any applications submitted during this period," said Carolina Rodriguez, director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program, speaking about the backlog.
"Once processing resumes, it's important to follow up promptly to ensure their application remains on track," Rodriguez said. "Beyond that, unfortunately, this remains a waiting game."]]></content>

Quantum computing stocks are wrapping up a big week of double-digit gains.
Shares of Rigetti Computing, D-Wave Quantum and Quantum Computing have surged more than 20%. Rigetti and D-Wave Quantum have more than doubled and tripled, respectively, since the start of the year. Arqit Quantum skyrocketed more than 42% this week.

The jump in shares followed a wave of positive news in the quantum space.
Rigetti said it had purchase orders totalling $5.7 million for two of its 9-qubit Novera quantum computing systems. The owner of drugmaker Novo Nordisk and the Danish government also invested 300 million euros in a quantum venture fund.
In a blog post earlier this week, Nvidia also highlighted accelerated computing, which it argues can make "quantum computing breakthroughs of today and tomorrow possible."
Investors have piled into quantum computing technology this year, as tech giants Microsoft, Nvidia and Amazon have embraced the technology with a wave of new chip announcements, multi-million dollar investments and research plans.

Smaller companies have also made strides.

Earlier this year, Maryland-based IonQ bought U.K.-based quantum computing startup Oxford Ionics in a roughly $1.1 billion deal, while Finland-based IQM said it raised $320 million in funding last month.
Proponents argue that quantum computing can solve problems too complex for regular computers and parse larger quantities of data. But critics say there's more work ahead before the technology successfully hits the market.
Google Quantum AI's director of hardware Julian Kelly told CNBC in March that the technology is "five years out from a real breakout."

The price of used electric vehicles has come down to levels comparable with gasoline cars, a dynamic poised to boost their popularity despite the loss of a federal tax incentive for EVs, according to auto analysts.
In August, the price premium for used EVs relative to used vehicles with a gasoline engine narrowed to just $897, on average, the smallest price gap on record, according to Cox Automotive.

The average list price for used EVs was $34,704 in August, down 1.1% from July and 2.6% from a year earlier, it found.
This price tag excludes a federal tax credit that ended after Sept. 30, after Republicans scrapped it as part of a multitrillion-dollar legislative package in July. That tax break was worth up to $4,000 for used EVs (and $7,500 for new EVs) — meaning the average used EV cost less than its gasoline counterpart after incentives.

Consumers bought nearly 41,000 used EVs in August, up 59% from a year earlier, Cox data shows.
Analysts expect that momentum to continue, driven in large part by affordability even absent the federal tax break.
2026 will be "the year of the used EV," said Scott Case, the CEO of Recurrent, an EV market research firm.


Why leased EVs help drive down prices for used ones

Automakers leaned heavily on leasing in recent years to move electric vehicles, analysts said.
Since 2023, more than 1.1 million EVs have been leased, Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox, wrote in an analysis last month.
This was partly due to the so-called leasing "loophole." Consumers could more easily claim a $7,500 tax credit when leasing a new EV than buying one, the latter of which came with more restrictions.

Now, a large volume of electric vehicles are reaching the end of their lease term. Lease returns and trade-ins are boosting the supply of used EVs, driving down prices, Valdez Streaty wrote.
In fact, 14 used EV models had a lower average price than their gasoline counterparts in August, according to Valdez Streaty.
"For mainstream buyers, EV affordability in the used-vehicle space is finally within reach," Valdez Streaty wrote.


The top-selling models — Tesla Model 3, Tesla Model Y, the General Motors-owned Chevrolet Bolt EV, Tesla Model S and Ford Mustang Mach-E — all had prices below the market average in August, which shows their appeal to budget-conscious buyers consumers, Valdez Streaty wrote.
For example, two high-volume models — the Renault-owned Nissan Leaf and the Tesla Model 3 — carried an average price tag of $12,890 and $23,278, respectively, according to Valdez Streaty. The Chevrolet Bolt EV was $14,705.

Not the 'end of affordable EVs'

By contrast, the market for new electric vehicles is likely to struggle for the rest of 2025 and into next year, analysts said.
Average new EV prices in August were $57,245, representing a nearly $9,100 premium over the average gasoline car, according to Cox Automotive.
That doesn't include the now-expired $7,500 federal tax credit, which brought new EVs closer to price parity with their gasoline counterparts.
"The tax credit helped get a lot of butts in seats," Aaron Bragman, Detroit bureau chief for Cars.com, told CNBC. "It helped a lot of people get into EVs."

However, there are still some relatively affordable new electric vehicles even without the federal tax break, he said.
For example, the 2025 Nissan Leaf has a starting price under $30,000, Bragman said.
A few others — the Fiat 500e, Hyundai Kona Electric and Chevrolet Equinox EV — have a starting price under $35,000, according to Cars.com.
"The end of the [tax] credit doesn't mean the end of affordable EVs," Bragman wrote in an e-mail. "Brands like Nissan, Chevrolet, and Hyundai are rolling out lower-priced options, and used EVs are getting more attractive too, with plenty available under $25,000. Battery costs are also coming down, which will help keep prices competitive in the long run."




For mainstream buyers, EV affordability in the used-vehicle space is finally within reach.

In fact, the tax break's expiration doesn't seem to negatively influence interest among prospective new-car buyers, according to J.D. Power.
More than half of new-vehicle shoppers are either "very likely" (24%) or "somewhat likely" (35%) to consider buying an EV in the next 12 months, rates that have remained fairly consistent for the past year, according to a September study by J.D. Power.

Total cost of ownership

Consumers should focus on total cost of ownership rather than upfront purchase price when choosing a car, analysts said.
This means a car owner should account not only for upfront purchase price, but for the full suite of financial costs, like repairs, maintenance and fuel.
Such costs are generally cheaper for electric vehicles, and can therefore make the lifetime cost of EV ownership less expensive than that of a gasoline-powered car, according to studies and industry experts.
"I think this is the bigger argument" in favor of EVs, said Case of Recurrent.
Factors like geography and charging accessibility are important here, analysts said. For example, relying heavily on public charging networks may flip the economic calculus, since public charging is often more expensive than charging at home, they said.

State incentives are still available

While the federal electric vehicle tax incentive has disappeared, there are additional incentives available from utilities, automakers, and state and local governments that can, in some instances, shave thousands of dollars off an EV's upfront cost, experts said.
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island are among the states that offer relatively generous incentives, analysts said.
"There are a lot of state supports still for these EVs," said Al Salas, CEO of Eco Auto, an EV dealer with operations in Massachusetts and Washington state.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Direct connections between India and China were suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic and never resumed — until now. The announcement comes amid a thawing in relations between New Delhi and Beijing.

Direct flights between the world's two most populous countries, India and China, are set to resume at the end of October for the first time in five years.
India's leading airline IndiGo announced on Friday that it would be offering daily non-stop connections between Calcutta and Guangzhou from October 26.
A second route from the Indian capital. New Delhi, to an as yet unconfirmed Chinese city is also planned.
"It has now been agreed that direct air services connecting designated points in India and China can resume by late October," read an Indian government statement released on Thursday.
"This agreement of the civil aviation authorities will further facilitate people-to-people contact between India and China, contributing towards the gradual normalization of bilateral exchanges."
The announcement comes on the back of the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Shanghai at the end of August, his first trip to China in seven years.
Modi declared at the time, alongside Chinese Premier Xi Jinping, that India and China were development partners, not rivals.

Indeed, opening bookings for its China flights on Friday, airline IndiGo said the move would reestablish avenues for cross-border trade and strategic business partnerships and promote tourism between the two nations."
Relations between China and India collapsed in 2020 after troops from both sides clashed along a disputed border in the Himalayan mountains. Four Chinese soldiers and 20 Indian troops were killed in the worst violence between the two countries in decades.
Direct flights were suspended anyway due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and were never resumed —until now, with observers attributing the thaw in relations to tariff threats made against both countries by US President Donald Trump.
In June, Beijing already granted permission to Indian pilgrims trekking to Mount Kailash in Tibet, a holy site for Hindus and Buddhists, for the first time since the 2020 border clashes.

The Trump administration on Friday froze $2.1 billion in Department of Transportation funding for two projects to improve Chicago's transit system.
The DOT in a statement blamed Congress' two Democratic leaders — Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries — for the federal government shutdown, which the department claimed would slow a review of the Chicago projects to ensure they do not involve "unconstitutional practices" related to the race or gender of construction workers.

That statement echoed a Trump administration talking point that Democrats in Congress are refusing to vote for a short-term funding agreement that would reopen the government because they insist on providing health-care benefits for "illegal immigrants."
Democrats call that claim a lie designed to distract from their goal of continuing the offer of enhanced Affordable Care Act health insurance plan subsidies to more than 20 million Americans.
"At a time when federal agents are sowing chaos in Chicago, the Trump administration is holding bipartisan funding hostage," Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said in a social media post on X after the DOT's announcement.
"It's attempting to score political points but is instead hurting our economy and the hardworking people who rely on public transit to get to work or school," wrote Pritzker, who, like Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, is a Democrat.
Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought first announced the freeze on the Chicago projects on Friday morning.

It was the third time in recent days that he revealed funding actions by the Trump administration targeting cities and states led by Democrats.
President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers have blamed Democrats in Congress for the shutdown, which hit its third day on Friday.
Trump said on Thursday that the shutdown had given him an "unprecedented opportunity" to cut what he called "Democrat Agencies."
Vought on Wednesday revealed that the Department of Transportation was freezing $18 billion in federal funding for two major infrastructure projects in New York City. Both Schumer and Jeffries are from New York City.
Later that same day, Vought said that the Department of Energy had cancelled nearly $8 billion in funding for climate-related projects and other efforts in 16 states, all of which were won by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.
On Friday, Vought, in a post on X, wrote, "$2.1 billion in Chicago infrastructure projects -- specifically the Red Line Extension and the Red and Purple Modernization Project -- have been put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing via race-based contracting."

Both projects are overseen by the Chicago Transit Authority, which operates the city's train and bus system.
The Red Line Extension project will extend that train line by 5.5 miles with four new stations between the existing terminal at 95th/Dan Ryan to 130th Street. The Red and Purple Modernization Project is reconstructing infrastructure along those color train lines.
The U.S. DOT later Friday said, "This week, USDOT issued an interim final rule (IFR) barring race- and sex-based contracting requirements from federal grants."
"To continue implementation of this rule, USDOT today sent letters to the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) to inform them that" the two CTA projects "are also under administrative review to determine whether any unconstitutional practices are occurring," the DOT said.
The DOT in its statement said the freeze on the Chicago money "is in addition to reviews of New York's Second Avenue Subway and Hudson Tunnel projects," the department said. "Illinois, like New York, is well known to promote race- and sex-based contracting and other racial preferences as a public policy."
The DOT also said that Americans "don't care what race or gender construction workers, pipefitters, or electricians are. They just want these massive projects finally built quickly and efficiently."
"Unfortunately, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries' decision to shut down the government has negatively affected the Department's staffing resources for carrying out this important analysis," the department said.
"We urge Democrats in Congress to stop holding the federal government's budget hostage so USDOT can get back to the important work of the American people," the DOT said.
"Benefits for illegal immigrants are not worth potential impacts to important investments in our nation's transportation infrastructure," the department said.]]></content>

Google on Friday joined Apple in removing apps that can be used to anonymously report sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and other law-enforcement authorities.
Apple on Thursday night said it was removing ICEBlock and other similar apps used to track authorities.

Apple's move came after direct pressure from Attorney General Pam Bondi, and amid controversy over the Trump administration's aggressive enforcement of immigration law with ICE agents and other authorities.
The FBI said last week that a gunman whose attack on a Dallas ICE facility led to the deaths of two detained immigrants and the wounding of a third detainee had recently searched apps tracking the presence of ICE agents.
The gunman, Joshua Jahn, intended to kill ICE agents in the attack, which ended with him fatally shooting himself, authorities said.
"We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps," Apple said in a statement to NBC News on Thursday.
"Based on information we've received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store," the company said.

On Friday, Google followed suit.
"ICEBlock was never available on Google Play, but we removed similar apps for violations of our policies," a Google spokesperson told NBC News.
The spokesperson said Google was not contacted by the Department of Justice about its prior offering of such apps.
Fox Business first reported Apple's booting of ICEBlock and other similar apps.
ICEBlock has been downloaded more than 1 million times since it was introduced this year, according to data provided to NBC News by the app tracking firm Appfigures. The app hit a high of nearly 114,000 downloads in a single day on July 1, a day after a CNN article about the app sparked criticism from the Trump administration.

Bondi, in a statement to Fox News Digital on Thursday, said, "We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store — and Apple did so."
"ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed," Bondi said in the statement.
"This Department of Justice will continue making every effort to protect our brave federal law enforcement officers, who risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe," she said.
CNBC has requested comment from Bondi.
Trump administration border czar Tom Homan, in an interview Thursday night with Fox News' Sean Hannity, said, "They're gonna investigate these people who put these apps up — because it puts law enforcement at great risk."
CNBC has reached out for comment from ICEBlock's creator, Joshua Aaron.
ICEBlock, which was introduced last spring, is free.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a post on X last week, noted that the man who opened fire at the ICE facility in Dallas on Sept. 24 "was using one of these apps" to track ICE agents.
ICEBlock became the top social networking app in Apple's App Store shortly after Leavitt condemned the app during a White House press briefing on June 30.
CNN, that same day, had published an article on the app that quoted Aaron as saying that he developed ICEBlock after seeing the Trump administration's deportation efforts escalate.
"When I saw what was happening in this country, I wanted to do something to fight back," Aaron said at the time, suggesting that the immigration enforcement efforts were reminiscent of Nazi Germany.
"We're literally watching history repeat itself."
ICE's acting director, Todd Lyons, on June 30 said, "Advertising an app that basically paints a target on federal law enforcement officers' backs is sickening."
"My officers and agents are already facing a 500% increase in assaults, and going on live television to announce an app that lets anyone zero in on their locations is like inviting violence against them with a national megaphone," Lyons said.
But Aaron, in an NBC interview days later, called the Trump administration's criticism of ICEBlock "another right-wing fearmongering scare tactic."
He said he designed the app to help immigrants who are afraid of being deported.
"I grew up in a Jewish household, and being part of the Jewish community, I had the chance to meet Holocaust survivors and learn the history of what happened in Nazi Germany, and the parallels that we can draw between what's happening right now in our country and Hitler's rise to power are undeniable," Aaron said.

EV market share in the U.S. hits 10.5%
Squawk on the Street




DETROIT – Tesla and General Motors are leading the U.S. automotive industry this year in record domestic sales of all-electric vehicles, as consumers hurried to buy EVs before up to $7,500 in federal incentives for each purchase ended in September.
New data provided to CNBC from Motor Intelligence shows U.S. sales of EVs, excluding hybrids,  topped 1 million units through the first nine months of the year and set a new quarterly record of more than 438,000 units sold during the third quarter — achieving market share of 10.5% for the period.

That record market share is up from 7.4% during the second quarter and 7.6% during the first three months of the year, according to Motor Intelligence. Sales of all-electric models were estimated to be 1.3 million in 2024, with a roughly 8% market share.
U.S. EV industry leader Tesla, which does not report sales by region, is estimated to have retained its leadership position with a 43.1% market share through September, according to the data. That's down from 49% to end last year, as competitors continue to release new EVs.

GM, which offers the most EV models in the U.S., has made significant gains this year. Motor Intelligence reported that the Detroit automaker went from an 8.7% market share to begin this year to 13.8% through the third quarter – topping Hyundai Motor, including Kia, at 8.6% through September.
The sales data comes two days after GM estimated it leads the U.S. industry in EV market share growth so far in 2025, with the lowest incentives of any major automaker. It sold 144,668 EVs through September, which still only represented 6.8% of its total U.S. sales.  
"No one is in a stronger position for a changing U.S. market than GM," Duncan Aldred, GM president of North America, said in a release. "We have the best lineup of ICE [internal combustion engine] and EV vehicles we've ever had. Our brands have grown market share with consistently strong pricing, and low incentives and inventory."

Following Tesla, GM and Hyundai, Motor Intelligence data shows Ford Motor's EV market share was 6.6% through the third quarter, followed by Volkswagen at 5.4%; Honda Motor at 4.6%; and BMW at 3.6%.

Despite sales increasing each quarter of this year, EV startups Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group continue to have a relatively small EV market share. Lucid remains under 1%, while Rivian was at 3% through September.
Major automakers reported third-quarter results this week that were led by EV sales. The rush to buy electric cars came ahead of the federal incentives for those vehicles ending as a result of the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act."
Industry analysts and executives believe the incentives ending will create a boom-and-bust cycle for the sale of EVs in the U.S.
Ford CEO Jim Farley on Tuesday said he "wouldn't be surprised" if sales of EVs fell from an industry market share of around 10% to 12% in September to 5% after the incentive program ends.
The end of EV credits for the U.S. comes as the country continues to trail other major automakers in the adoption of zero-emission vehicles. The International Energy Agency reports China continued to lead EV adoption globally last year, with sales of 6.4 million all-electric vehicles, not counting hybrids, followed by Europe at 2.2 million units.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Tesla posted stronger-than-expected third-quarter vehicle deliveries , but shares fell sharply as Wall Street analysts flagged looming headwinds ranging from the end of U.S. electric vehicle tax credits to continued pressure on profit margins. Quarterly vehicle deliveries through Sept. 30, when a key tax credit for EV buyers in the U.S. expired, climbed 7% during the same period a year ago. Yet, despite the better-than-feared deliveries, Tesla shares tumbled 5.1% Thursday, cutting Elon Musk's flagship company's 2025 gain to 8%. TSLA 5D mountain Tesla over past 5 days Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan warned demand could soften once EV tax credits and other promotions fade. "In Q3, TSLA reportedly offered various incentives to buttress deliveries, including up to $2K discounts on U.S. Y/3 inventory, 18 months of free supercharging on M3 in the U.S./[Canada] & other supercharging promo packages," Langan wrote in a note. Langan expects Tesla's fourth-quarter deliveries to weaken, with added margin pressure and lower regulatory credit sales leaving his 2025 earnings estimate about 29% below the Wall Street consensus. Goldman Sachs analysts also said the expiration of tax credits will "likely be a headwind" in the fourth quarter, but seasonality and new model launches could mitigate the blow. Goldman is looking ahead for positive catalysts in the next few months, including third-quarter earnings that could benefit from the stronger deliveries and higher energy deployments, as well as Tesla's Nov. 6 shareholder meeting. "If Tesla can give investors more confidence on the longer-term profit opportunity," Goldman wrote, "that could help sentiment." — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.]]></content>

英國王儲威廉在一個串流平台節目，接受主持人加拿大演員尤真力菲訪問，罕有地廣泛談及他生活各方面。威廉形容去年是他度過最艱難的一年，特別是父親英王查理斯三世與妻子凱特相繼患癌，承認家庭相關的事令他有很大壓力。

英國王儲威廉說：「生命帶來考驗，而能夠克服考驗，才能讓我們成為真正的自己。」

至於2022年逝世的祖母伊利沙伯二世，威廉承認想念她。

主持問：「你想念你的祖母嗎？」

威廉回答：「確實是這樣，我確實想念我的祖母和祖父，這裡發生了很大變化，你會想到他們已經不在這裡了，尤其是在溫莎。對我來說溫莎就是她，她喜歡這裡，她大部分時間都在這裡度過。這天帶你四處參觀，我努力確保我是按照，她希望你看到的方式去做。」

英國廣播公司引述王室消息人士指，這次是威廉至今為止最坦誠的一次訪問。他亦被問及如何看待未來將要擔任國王的角色，威廉回應指變革已列入他的議程，將在成為國王後，為君主制帶來改變，對於好的變革，他會欣然接受、並不害怕。

訪問並未深入觸及威廉同弟弟哈里兩兄弟的關係，但當被問及在父母嚴密監督下成長的王室經歷時，威廉提到會盡自己所能，希望不要重蹈自己同弟弟成長過程的覆轍。]]></content>

破產欠薪保障基金委員會向立法會提交2024/25年度周年報告。期內接獲申請共5,188宗，按年增加百分之38.4，涉款逾6億元。

當中申請數目最多的行業是餐飲服務業，其次是建造業、體育及其他娛樂活動。這三個行業的申請佔總數六成半。

至於期內批准的申請，包括部分屬之前的申請，共有5,398宗，按年多逾七成；發放的特惠款項達2.97億元，按年升逾九成。

破欠基金上年度總收入3.2億元，其中商業登記費收入是1,660萬元。期內錄得虧損3,030萬元，而前一個財政年度有3.4億元盈餘。截至今年3月底，基金累積盈餘有72.8億元。

破欠基金委員會主席馬豪輝在周年報告指，環球經濟下行風險和不明朗因素顯著增加，為香港經濟帶來壓力，向基金提出申請的僱員相應增加。而特惠款項支出顯著攀升，主因是年內處理多宗大型倒閉個案。]]></content>

Walmart-backed OnePay to offer crypto trading
Squawk on the Street




OnePay, the fintech firm majority-owned by Walmart, will soon offer cryptocurrency trading and custody on its mobile app, CNBC has learned.
OnePay will offer customers access to bitcoin and ether later this year with help from the startup Zerohash, according to people with knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified before an official announcement.

The move shows that OnePay, founded by Walmart and venture firm Ribbit Capital in 2021, sees crypto as a core offering as it builds out its "everything app" for digital finance.
The fintech firm has methodically added new products in its quest to become an American super app akin to overseas offerings like WeChat. The company now offers banking services including high-yield savings accounts; credit and debit cards; buy now, pay later loans and even wireless plans.
By allowing OnePay users to hold bitcoin and ether in their mobile app, customers could presumably convert their crypto into cash and then use those funds to make store purchases or pay off card balances.
Spokespeople for New York-based OnePay and Chicago-based Zerohash declined to comment.

Crypto continues to gain mainstream adoption after the U.S. government's stance towards the nascent technology flipped with the election of President Donald Trump. Big banks that couldn't previously develop crypto offerings are now starting to do so; last month Morgan Stanley said it would soon offer retail clients direct access to crypto through its E-Trade subsidiary.

The overall trend has boosted a constellation of public and private companies involved in crypto. Last month, Zerohash raised $104 million in funding from financial firms including Morgan Stanley and Interactive Brokers, part of its strategy to enmesh itself with banks and brokers that are building crypto products.
For OnePay, which benefits from its ties with the world's largest retailer, there are signs that its mobile app is gaining traction, even before the crypto rollout.
The fintech firm is now No. 5 on Apple's app store ranking for free finance apps, ahead of larger companies including JPMorgan Chase, Robinhood and Chime. Nearly all the apps ahead of OnePay in that list, including PayPal, Venmo and Cash App, already offer crypto.
From the time it was created, OnePay's big advantage was in its distribution channel. The firm's app is integrated into the in-person and online checkout process at Walmart's U.S. locations, giving it access to the 150 million Americans who shop there every week.
But OnePay was created as an entity separate from the retailer so it wouldn't be limited to only Walmart customers, instead appealing to the broader population of Americans who are underserved by traditional banks.

Warren Buffett and Greg Abel walkthrough the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025. 
David A. Grogen | CNBC 


Berkshire Hathaway formally separated the roles of chairman and chief executive officer, a long-anticipated move that paves the way for Greg Abel to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO at the beginning of 2026.
In a new regulatory filing, the Omaha-based conglomerate said its board voted on Sept. 30 to amend its bylaws to distinguish the two top roles, effective immediately. Buffett, who has run Berkshire since 1965, will remain chairman of the board, while Abel, currently vice chairman for non-insurance operations, will take over as CEO on Jan. 1, 2026.

The move was first announced by the 95-year-old Buffett at the end of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in May, which took many by surprise. Shortly after the initial announcement, Berkshire's board unanimously approved Abel's appointment.
Buffett, even at his advanced age, has likely stayed active at the conglomerate. Just earlier this week, Berkshire announced it is acquiring OxyChem, the chemical arm of Occidental Petroleum, in a roughly $9.7 billion all-cash transaction. It marks Berkshire's biggest deal in three years.
Abel, 63, has been seen as Buffett's heir apparent since Charlie Munger, Berkshire's late vice chairman, publicly identified him as the chosen successor in 2021. He joined the Berkshire orbit when Berkshire acquired a controlling interest in MidAmerican Energy in 1999, and he later became CEO of the energy firm.
Since 2018, Abel has served as Berkshire's vice chairman for non-insurance operations, overseeing railroad, utilities, energy, manufacturing and retail businesses.]]></content>

豆腐渣「升級」再造，都可成為零食脆片。四名大學碩士生去年合資20多萬元成立社企，收集豆品公司廢棄的豆渣，再製造成產品銷售。

社會企業創辦人黃芷晴表示：「廚餘問題都是香港現在面臨的一個大問題；第二，就是香港真的很少地方會用到豆腐渣製造產品，而我們是比較特別一點。」

他們獲粵港澳大灣區青年創業資助計劃批出最高的60萬元資助。

主辦機構「香港新一代文化協會」以民青局批出的600萬元，配對民間慈善基金150萬元，向19個初創項目提供兩年期資助，涵蓋社會企業、人工智能(AI)、大數據、醫療及生物科技公司等。

同樣獲60萬元資助的，有這間電商科技及營商公司。

電商科技及營商公司創辦人石桉昊說：「作為一間初創公司，我們有很多部分尚未完善，例如在這個階段，雖然我們做了大半年生意，但是我們連自己的網站還沒推出，所以未來收到項目的資助，可能就會幫助我們做一些品牌的建立、宣傳和網上的營銷等。」

主辦機構指，過去兩期計劃合共資助了26個項目，包括有食品公司及智能檢測公司等。]]></content>

Stock markets are due a "drawdown" in the next year or two after years of being propelled to record highs by an AI frenzy, according to Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.
"Markets run in cycles, and whenever we've historically had a significant acceleration in a new technology that creates a lot of capital formation, and therefore lots of interesting new companies around it, you generally see the market run ahead of the potential ... there are going to be winners and losers," he said at Italian Tech Week in Turin, Italy, on Friday.

Solomon pointed to the mass adoption of the internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which led to the emergence of some of the world's largest companies — but also saw investors lose money to what became known as the "dotcom bubble."

"You're going to see a similar phenomenon here," he said. "I wouldn't be surprised if in the next 12 to 24 months, we see a drawdown with respect to equity markets ... I think that there will be a lot of capital that's deployed that will turn out to not deliver returns, and when that happens, people won't feel good."
An AI boom has gripped global markets in recent years, with a slew of new technologies, multibillion-dollar deals and the continued rise of ChatGPT-developer OpenAI. It's seen investors bet big on the tech and pour capital into stocks such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Palantir and Nvidia.


The AI trade could rapidly unravel – and one hedge fund is preparing for the fallout

The buzz around AI has helped to push indexes on Wall Street and beyond to record highs, even as the major U.S. averages were dented earlier this year by President Donald Trump's trade policies. However, as investors have continued to seek out opportunities in AI, concerns have been raised about the possibility of a bubble bursting somewhere down the line.
"I'm not going to use the word bubble, because I don't know, I don't know what the path will be, but I do know people are out on the risk curve because they're excited," Solomon said Friday.

"And when [investors are] excited, they tend to think about the good things that can go right, and they diminish the things you should be skeptical about that can go wrong ... There will be a reset, there will be a check at some point, there will be a drawdown. The extent of that will depend on how long this [bull run] goes," he added.
Solomon is not alone in having concerns about current market levels. Speaking at the same event, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said Friday that artificial intelligence is currently in an "industrial bubble."
And earlier this week, veteran investor Leon Cooperman told CNBC that we are in the late innings of a bull market where bubbles can form — something Warren Buffett had warned about.
Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer of equities at Selwood Asset Management, meanwhile, warned of "enormous risks" on the horizon for the AI trade which could rapidly unravel. "The AI trade is beginning to resemble one of the great speculative manias of market history," Moussalem, who runs a market-neutral equity strategy at the London-based hedge fund, said in a post on LinkedIn.





But while Solomon predicted some money would be lost, he also appeared optimistic about artificial intelligence.
"I sleep very well. I'm not going to bed every night worried about what will happen next," Solomon said Friday. "Generally speaking, I think what's super exciting is the technology is expanding, new companies are being formed, and the potential of this technology deployed into the enterprise can be very, very powerful. So, it's an exciting time."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[內地國慶中秋長假期第三日，合共逾66萬人次內地旅客入境，有旅行團安排團員到連鎖快餐店午膳，爭取更多時間遊覽。

午飯時間，這間在尖沙咀星光行的快餐店，入面迫滿人，不少是內地旅客，更是旅行團客。

內地旅行團遊客張先生表示：「比較方便，都是這個旅行社他們包的，也不知道貴不貴，對，(團費)包括了。」

內地旅行團遊客藍先生說：「想食好食的，就跟大家推薦的找；單純想湊合一下，就快餐店解決就好。」

有旅行社指，近年旅客除了消費模式有轉變，午膳的地點及方式都跟了香港人，「要快」。

旅行社接洽人李先生稱：「很多團友傾向快及方便性，因為尖沙咀始終是旅遊景點，近星光大道及天星小輪，更傾向於附近食快餐，爭取時間瀏覽香港更多景點。」

有旅遊業界指，這些「散客團」兩日一夜團費承惠二百元，包車、包午餐及晚餐，但不包酒店，旅客要自行找「落腳地」。

旅行社會預先與快餐店洽談好，團客一到、就提供一至兩款快餐，如粟米肉粒飯、滑蛋牛肉飯等。

不想食快餐，旅客可選擇「團餐」。在土瓜灣榮光街午飯時間，見到不少旅客。酒樓坐滿七成人，有肉、有菜，白飯還有一大盆。

上海旅客竇女士指出：「清菜、魚餅這些，還可以、蠻乾淨的。」

廣州旅客李女士說：「跟團其實是便宜，只需百多元，相等於過來消費。」

食完午飯上車，前往下一個景點。有區議員指，部分旅行團分流到其他區用膳後，土瓜灣交通大有改善。

九龍城區議員關浩洋表示：「最高峰一條街見到六、七輛旅遊巴，旅客抵達後亦相對守規矩，餐廳有工作人員在街上指揮一下。沒有以前那種水洩不通情況，以前街坊完全行不到，車也塞到動不了。」

他亦指，旅遊業界與地區多了溝通，減少旅行團帶來的不便。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Freeport-McMoRan is likely to rebound from an environmental disaster last month at its giant Grasberg mine in Indonesia that led the copper-and-gold producer to cut its production estimates, according to UBS. The investment bank upgraded Freeport to buy from neutral in a report out Thursday, raising its 12-month price target on the stock to $48 from $42.50, implying more than 23% upside from Thursday's close. "We believe the market is pricing in an overly pessimistic outcome for Grasberg recover, therefore see the risk vs reward as attractive," UBS analyst Daniel Major wrote to clients. Freeport last month declared force majeure at its Grasberg mine in Papua, Indonesia, in the western half of New Guinea, following a mud rush at the site that killed two and left five missing. Phoenix-based Freeport later slashed its 2026 estimate for copper production at the mine by 35%. FCX 1M mountain Freeport-McMoRan over the past month. The lower production forecast dented Wall Street's confidence in Freeport's growth estimates, but the effect of the environmental incident on its mining business is likely to be short-lived, according to UBS. "We have consulted various mining experts & they see the risk of a structural impairment to Grasberg's production/value as low with water challenges relatively easier to resolve at Grasberg (up a mountain) vs many underground mines," Major wrote. The UBS call is in line with the majority on the Street, where 12 of 22 analysts rate Freeport a buy or strong buy, according to LSEG data. Freeport shares rose about 2% on Friday, after tumbling 20.5% last week.]]></content>

Elon Musk this week urged his followers to cancel their Netflix subscriptions over a controversy surrounding an animated show and its creator.
Musk on Wednesday posted on his X platform saying, "Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids." The post was in response to an image accusing Netflix of carrying out a "transgender woke agenda."

The controversy seems to stem from conservative backlash over an animated Netflix show, "Dead End: Paranormal Park," which features a transgender character. The show was canceled in 2023 after two seasons.
In addition to several anti-trans posts, Musk also responded to a post criticizing alleged statements made by the show's creator, Hamish Steele, that a prominent conservative X account said "mocked" the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Steele responded to Musk's callout on rival social media platform Bluesky saying, "It's probably going to be a very odd day." Steele also shared a post by TV writer Jack Bernhardt that called "Dead End" a "brilliant show about kind, wonderful characters."
Also this week, vocal conservative activist Robby Starbuck began posting about Netflix, echoing anti-trans sentiments and arguing the company has promoted an ideology that is "hateful to White Americans." Starbuck, who has repeatedly targeted major corporations in recent months over diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, said in one of his X posts on Netflix, "No one should give this woke company another dime." 
Netflix did not respond to requests for comment from CNBC.

‘Fast Money’ traders talk Netflix shares dropping after Elon Musk tells people to cancel
Fast Money




Analysts say the backlash might not pose as big of a threat to Netflix as Musk may be hoping for.
Netflix reported 301.63 million subscribers as of the fourth quarter of 2024, the last time it reported the metric before shifting priority to revenue over user growth. The company has a roughly $490 billion market cap, and its stock is up more than 60% in the past year.
Shares are down about 5% so far this week.
"Is that going to move the needle necessarily? ... You're going to see people sign up on the back of that to counter it," CNBC contributor Guy Adami said Wednesday on "Fast Money."
"I don't think this is a reason to sell the stock," he added.
Wedbush Securities' Alicia Reese told CNBC that the comments came too late in the third quarter to make any meaningful impact on subscriber counts.
Still, she said she believes the backlash won't make a major dent and that any impact will be offset by an increase in ad revenue.
"Their numbers should come out just fine," Reese said. "I think that shares haven't been hit too hard."
Seymour Asset Management's Tim Seymour said though a day of headlines may move the stock around, Netflix shares are ultimately too expensive to be significantly affected by internet backlash.
"We've had these moments in time where, whether it was an ad campaign that went wrong or whether it was some sense that a company was aligned in a particular political channel... I don't think that that's going to be the reason to sell Netflix here," Seymour said Wednesday.
The calls for a boycott mirror those against Anheuser-Busch InBev in 2023 after it released an ad campaign with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. But the boycott of Bud Light, CNBC contributor Karen Finerman noted on Wednesday, yielded "far greater" destruction than any other recent examples.
"I feel like this will be very fleeting," Finerman said.]]></content>

民航局長何淑萍今日接受媒體專訪時表示，今年我國在國際航權上已有多項進展，包括與芬蘭簽署新航約，以及大幅增加義大利航權。尤其在義大利部分，原本台義航權每周僅有7班，此次將增加至19班。何淑萍指出，義大利是台灣旅客熟悉且需求穩定的市場，無論是羅馬或米蘭，都具有高度觀光與商務價值。

根據統計，2024年台義雙邊旅運已達17.9萬人次，隨著班次大幅增加，市場規模可望持續擴大。她也舉例，目前台灣飛米蘭每周僅4班，未達每日直飛標準，旅客往返常須額外停留一至兩日，若能達到每日直航，將大幅增加便利性，對商務客更為重要。


據了解，國籍航空均有表達對義大利有興趣，紛紛提出申請，不論是增班還是新增，目前除了已經有在飛的華航與長榮外，星宇此次也有對米蘭提出申請並取得航權。


不過，星宇原先就積極布局明年歐洲航線，如今成功搶下米蘭航權，意味台灣三大航空公司將齊聚義大利。對此，星宇回應，相關航點都在積極規劃中，有最新進展會立即對外公布。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[一號戒備信號現正生效，並會在明日中午前維持。強烈熱帶風暴麥德姆逐步增強，天文台考慮在明日下午初時改發三號強風信號。

下星期一就是中秋節，這晚還可以見到皎潔的明月，但隨後一兩日天氣將會轉差。

天文台表示，強烈熱帶風暴麥德姆晚上至周六早上，會與本港保持約500公里或以上距離。按照現時預測，麥德姆會逐步增強，並靠近雷州半島至海南島東部一帶。

本港風勢周六稍後將逐漸增強。天文台會考慮周六下午初時改發三號強風信號。

署理天文台高級科學主任呂旭昇表示：「之後天文台會視乎麥德姆的強度、其烈風區與珠江口的距離，以及本地風力的變化，去評估是否需要掛更高的熱帶氣旋警告信號。」

預料周六日間仍然酷熱，稍後有幾陣狂風驟雨及雷暴，離岸及高地間中風力達8級，即烈風程度，海有湧浪及大浪。

九天天氣預報顯示，到下星期一、即中秋節當日，大致多雲，有一兩陣驟雨，日間部分時間有陽光。

另外，天文台回顧上月天氣，除了經歷塔巴、米娜及樺加沙三個熱帶氣旋吹襲，9月有15日須發出酷熱天氣警告，是有紀錄以來其中最多的一個9月。另外錄得13個熱夜，打破2021年的紀錄。

OpenAI's new artificial intelligence video app Sora has already grabbed the top spot in Apple's App Store as its number one free app, despite being invite-only.
Sora, which was launched on Tuesday, allows users to create short-form AI videos and share them in a feed. The app is available to iPhone users but requires an invite code to access.

Here's how to snag a Sora app invite code:

First, download the app from the iOS App Store. Note that Sora requires iOS 18.0 or later to be downloaded.
Login using your OpenAI account.
Click "Notify me when access opens."

A screen will then appear asking for an access code. 
Currently, OpenAI has said that it is prioritizing paying ChatGPT Pro users for Sora access. The app is only available in the U.S. and Canada, but is expected to roll out to additional countries soon, the company said.

If you do not know someone who can provide an access code, several people are sharing invite codes on the official OpenAI Discord server, as well as on X and Reddit threads.
Once you input your access, you will be able to start generating AI videos using text or images. Users are also able to cameo as characters in their videos as well as "remix" other posts.
The app is powered by the new Sora 2.0 model, an updated version of the original Sora model from last year. The video generation model is "physically accurate, realistic, and more controllable" than prior systems, the company said in a blog post.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[IT之家 10 月 3 日消息，美国亚马逊 FAR、麻省理工、加州大学伯克利分校、斯坦福大学、卡内基梅隆大学等高校团队本周公布了最新研究成果 —— OmniRetarget，这是一个基于交互网格的交互保留数据生成引擎，可以生成运动学上可行的轨迹。
 
根据研究团队放出的演示视频，宇树 G1 人形机器人完成了一个复杂、长时程的动态序列，完全由本体感觉策略驱动（无需视觉 / 激光雷达）。
在一个任务中，宇树 G1 机器人携带一把椅子到桌子旁，将其作为踏板爬上去，然后跳下并执行类似跑酷的翻滚动作来缓冲落地。

OmniRetarget 是一个基于交互网格的交互保留数据生成引擎，它明确建模并保留了智能体、地形和被操作物体之间关键的空间和接触关系。通过最小化人类和机器人网格之间的拉普拉斯变形，同时强制执行运动学约束，OmniRetarget 生成了运动学上可行的轨迹。
研究团队通过从多个数据集中重新目标追踪运动，全面评估了 OmniRetarget，生成了超过 9 小时轨迹，这些轨迹在运动学约束满足和接触保持方面优于广泛使用的基线。这种数据使本体感觉强化学习策略能够在宇树 G1 人形机器人上成功执行长时程（长达 30 秒）的跑酷和运动操作技能，仅使用 5 个奖励项和所有任务共享的简单领域随机化进行训练，没有任何学习课程。

该团队放出了多个演示案例，包括翻滚、爬桌子、跳上小箱子、爬行等。

此外，OmniRetarget 能够让人形机器人以多种风格进行运动操作，比如 8 种搬箱子的动作。

该研究的论文、数据集均已公布，代码将在后续放出，IT之家附研究页面地址：

賴正鎰強調，現在房市因第七波信用管制措施，買氣低迷，他認為當前市場仍有買盤，只是銷售期從原先半年拉長至1年半，建案完工前大都能完銷，因此不易撼動預售建案房價。


他認為，未來2~3年是房價調整期，雙北市中心、蛋黃區房價不會降價，且還有可能因為營造成本波動出現2~3%漲幅。


不過，賴正鎰表示，蛋白區因供給量相對大，有機會出現10~15%盤整下修空間，認為口袋深的建商不會降價，但對資金需求高的中小建商，有可能有下修空間。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[IT之家 10 月 3 日消息，《绝地潜兵 2》游戏开发者 Brendan Armstrong 今天在 Steam 发布博文，解释这款游戏的 PC 版本体积为何非常庞大。

开发者表示，《绝地潜兵 2》的 PC 版大小是 150GB，几乎是主机版的三倍，这部分多出来的体积主要是为了照顾机械硬盘而特意弄出来的重复数据，好让这些硬盘能够用重复数据更快速寻道，减少加载时间。

而本世代的游戏机都采用了 SSD（IT之家注：固态硬盘），没有这部分重复数据，游戏体积自然就会变小。

Armstrong 解释道，目前他们的 PC 版游戏并没有强制要求使用固态硬盘，同时根据后台数据推算，仍有 12% 玩家仍在使用机械硬盘玩他们的游戏，所以公司没有放弃机械硬盘，让这些玩家可以更快地玩上在线游戏。
尽管如此，Armstrong 的工作室仍在探寻多种解决方案，但他强调，这些重复数据无法彻底消除，否则机械硬盘的加载速度将变慢 10 倍，这是不可接受的，至少他认为在绝大多数玩家都换用 SSD 前，牺牲游戏体积来换取体验提升是必要的。

不过 Armstrong 也表示，他们还是需要探索更折中的方案，谨慎权衡各种成本，在游戏体积和加载时间之间找到新的平衡。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[美國聯邦政府停擺，民生服務受阻，有當地華人指，特朗普就任總統大半年，社會分歧越來越大。

臨時撥款法案陷入僵局，爭議之一是民主黨要求在共和黨提出的法案中，延長醫保補貼，即所謂「奧巴馬醫保」，但遭到否決。

洛杉磯華人Jordan Chan稱：「由奧巴馬年代買到現在，因為其實有保障到自己，我們可能支付數十元美金，就可能買到一個月(醫保)。」

因應「奧巴馬醫保」，美國聯邦政府每年補貼超過500億美元，但就被特朗普政府批評是財政負擔，Jordan說，特朗普上任大半年，社會分歧越來越大。

Jordan Chan說：「我們移民或內地人都會覺得，好像政策越來越奇怪，令很多人都想離開美國。整天都會人心惶惶的感覺，即是明天會這樣、後天又那樣，政府究竟想怎樣。」

特朗普上任後，經常說要削減開支，有本港學者指，民主黨要求在臨時撥款法案中，延長醫保補貼，是想贏得基層支持。

時事評論員趙雨樂指出：「特朗普揮動大棒，指著無論醫療、教育、所有社會福利都會削減。對於窮人來說，教育削減、津貼減少，子女讀書怎麼辦？醫療方面，你又說這些不保障、那些不保障，那怎麼辦呢？」

路透社9月做的民調顯示，特朗普支持度仍有百分之42，對比1月上任時，跌了5個百分點。

智明研究社研究總監許楨指出：「特朗普第二次回朝，他要做甚麼呢？第一我不是做總統，我要做王；第二要做甚麼人的王呢？是一半美國人的王，只要拿到一半美國人的支持，在行政、立法權各方面就會取得勝利，政策永遠只求滿足一半美國人。」

美國聯邦政府自1976年以來，曾停擺超過20次。最長一次是2018年，特朗普第一屆任期內就持續了35天。

 Trump's ultimatum to Hamas: Agree to deal 'or be hunted down, killed'
    
US President Donald Trump said the Hamas militant group had been "a ruthless and violent threat, for many years, in the Middle East!"
"They have killed (and made lives unbearably miserable), culminating with the October 7th MASSACRE, in Israel," Trump wrote. 
The Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel of October 7, 2023, killed nearly 1,200 people and saw 251 more taken hostage. 
"As retribution for the October 7th attack on civilization, more than 25,000 Hamas 'soldiers' have already been killed," Trump said, adding that those that remained "are surrounded and MILITARILY TRAPPED."
Trump said that he only needed to give the word "'GO' for their lives to be extinguished."
The US president said members "will be hunted down, and killed" if the group did not agree to his peace proposal.
Trump also reiterated that the plan includes the release of all remaining hostages. There are 48 hostages still in captivity — Israeli officials believe that about 20 are alive.

 Situation facing mothers and newborns 'never been worse' — UNICEF

The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) reports that mothers and newborn babies are facing dire conditions in Gaza, as the Nasser hospital in the south is becoming increasingly overwhelmed by patients who fled from northern Gaza.
"The situation for mothers and newborns in Gaza has never been worse. In Nasser hospital, we're seeing hospital corridors lined with women who've just given birth," UNICEF spokesperson James Elder told reporters in Geneva via video link from Gaza.
Elder described new mothers and newborn babies lying on the hospital floor and reported seeing three premature babies sharing a single supply of oxygen.
"They shared 20 minutes each. The other two children cry while the third child gets that oxygen for 20 minutes," Elder said.
Elder said there was no safe space in the south of the Gaza Strip, and that designated safe zones were "places of death."
"The notion of a safe zone in the south is farcical," Elder.
Palestinians have been repeatedly urged by Israel to move to a "humanitarian area" in Al-Mawasi, where aid is provided.
Elder said Al-Mawasi "is now one of the most densely populated places on Earth. It's grotesquely overcrowded and has been stripped of the most basic essentials of survival."

 Activists says all Global Sumud Flotilla vessels intercepted
    
Organizers of the Global Sumud Flotilla said the Israeli military had intercepted the last boat that had been attempting to reach Gaza on Friday.
This comes a day after most of the vessels were stopped with Israeli security forces detaining about 450 activists, including Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg.
In a statement, the Global Sumud Flotilla said Israeli naval forces had "illegally intercepted all 42 of our vessels — each carrying humanitarian aid, volunteers, and the determination to break Israel’s illegal siege on Gaza."
The Israeli Foreign Ministry said it was making arrangements to deport the activists, journalists, lawmakers and lawyers who made up the convoy.
"Procedures are under way to wrap up the Hamas-Sumud provocation and to finalize the deportation of the participants in this sham," Israel's Foreign Ministry said.
"Attached are photos of Greta Thunberg and other members of this provocation while arriving to Israel. All are safe and in good health," the ministry said in a post on X.

 Trump gives Hamas new deadline, issues threat via social media
    
US President Donald Trump has set Sunday, 6 p.m. Washington time (2200 UTC/GMT), as the deadline for the militant group Hamas to accept a deal to end the war in Gaza or face "all hell."
"An Agreement must be reached with Hamas by Sunday Evening at SIX (6) P.M., Washington, D.C. time," Trump wrote on his Truth Media platform.
"Every Country has signed on! If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas. THERE WILL BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER," Trump wrote.
The US president unveiled the plan alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party said on Friday that the government of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is dividing the country. 


October 3 marks the 35th anniversary of the reunification of West and East Germany. 


"Today, the CDU government under Chancellor Merz is splitting the country with its policy. It creates divisions and builds barriers, excluding millions of citizens and voters simply because, from their point of view, they have the wrong opinion or vote for the wrong party. Instead of creating prosperous environment, recent policies have sparked multiple crises and pushed the nation to the brink of collapse," the AFD said on X on the occasion of German Unity Day. 






The CDU/CSU coalition, part of Germany's ruling government, follows a "firewall" policy of boycotting AfD initiatives and refusing any cooperation. 

On October 3, 1990, the official reunification of Germany took place, dissolving the GDR (East Germany) and West Berlin as separate entities. By the Moscow Treaty signed in September 1990, a united Germany gained full sovereignty in domestic and foreign affairs.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ニューヨークのウォール街=AP

【NQNニューヨーク=矢内純一】3日の米株式市場でダウ工業株30種平均は6日続伸して始まり、午前9時35分現在は前日比150ドル66セント高の4万6670ドル38セントで推移している。前日に付けた最高値（4万6519ドル）を上回っている。市場参加者の関心が高い米雇用統計の9月分の発表が延期となった。手掛かりに欠けるなか、米連邦準備理事会（FRB）の利下げ期待が引き続き相場を支えている。
ダウ平均はその後も上げ幅を500ドル超にまで広げ、初めて4万7000ドル台に乗せた。
与野党対立で10月からの新会計年度の歳出をまかなうための「つなぎ予算」が成立しておらず、政府機関の一部閉鎖が3日目に入った。閉鎖が長期化すれば、米国の消費や企業収益の下押しにつながる可能性がある。
政府閉鎖の影響で、3日朝に予定されていた9月の米雇用統計の発表は延期となった。ダウ・ジョーンズ通信がまとめた市場予想によると、9月の米雇用統計で非農業部門の雇用者数は前月比5万1000人増えると見込まれている。
労働市場の減速を背景にFRBが10月の米連邦公開市場委員会（FOMC）でも利下げを決めるとの観測は根強い。株高基調が続き、買い遅れないように投資家が持ち高を増やしているとの見方もある。
ダウ平均の構成銘柄ではユナイテッドヘルス・グループやIBM、セールスフォースが上昇している。キャタピラーやJPモルガン・チェースも高い。半面、ナイキが下落している。
ハイテク株比率の高いナスダック総合株価指数は6日続伸して始まり、前日に付けた最高値（2万2844）を上回って推移している。半導体のブロードコムやマイクロン・テクノロジーに買いが入っている。一方、半導体製造装置のアプライドマテリアルズ（AMAT）は安い。米政府の新しい対中輸出規制が売上高を押し下げるとの見通しを示したことが重荷となっている。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[【环球网报道 记者 赵建东】国庆中秋假期伊始，中国旅游市场呈现强劲活力。在江西景德镇，一位鸡排摊主因特色经营方式意外走红网络，被网友亲切称为“鸡排哥”。据美国彭博社报道，“鸡排哥”的摊位连日来吸引大批游客，形成独特假日景观。

彭博社称，最近社交媒体爆火的“鸡排哥”，他的摊位在被誉为中国瓷都的景德镇，这里销售制作瓷器已有数千年之久，但是现在人们开始选择“鸡排”。彭博社的主持人还在节目中，将“鸡排哥”的特色制作方式描述为“表演性运动”，主持人还不断重复“鸡排哥”的标志性台词，“做你的，做你的，做完你的再做你的”。
报道称，“鸡排哥”走红后，现在游客们正蜂拥而至到景德镇品尝他制作的“鸡排”，就连彭博社的主持人都迫不及待询问“这个鸡排好不好吃”，另一名主持人回答：“一定，不然人们也不会在这排队几小时”。随后，主持人介绍说还有一个温暖人心的现象是，当地人对远道而来的游客们也都非常热情，他们送来椅子提供给游客，让游客们坐等享用鸡排。

彭博社的主持人还在节目中称，“鸡排哥”的爆火还得到当地政府支持。当地政府在“鸡排哥”摊位所在的路段铺设道路，形成“鸡排大道”，以至于他的摊位现在都成为热门打卡地，并在中国的社交媒体上成为热门话题。
据悉，“鸡排哥”名叫李俊永，江西南昌人，因亲切的服务态度、独特的经营方式以及快溢出来的情绪价值，吸引了大批顾客。由于“鸡排哥”稳定的出摊时间和亲民风格，不少学生或各地的顾客每天都会按时前来购买，若他临时缺席还会被追问去向，被网友笑称为“鸡排主理人”，6元的鸡排卖出了60元的情绪价值。
“炸不到位，我是无法原谅我自己的”，“你可以拒绝我，但是请你不要拒绝美味”，新加坡《联合早报》称，“鸡排哥”李俊永凭借幽默口才和真诚服务态度，加上时刻爆出无厘头金句，受到中国网民喜爱，他的档口成了今年国庆中秋假期全中国最火热的打卡地标之一。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[【Now新聞台】英國曼徹斯特猶太教堂襲擊案，釀成2死4重傷。當地警方公布，分別有一名死者和一名傷者身上有疑似槍傷，不排除是警員制止兇徒時造成。

                                
                            
                            
                            
                        
                    
                        
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                
猶太教的贖罪日當天，曼徹斯特有猶太教堂遭遇恐怖襲擊。附近街道事發翌日，即當地周五早上仍被封鎖，多名警員駐守，有民眾在附近擺放鮮花悼念。

                                
                            
                            
                            
                        
                    
                        
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                
35歲疑兇、敘利亞裔英國公民阿什邁被警方當場擊斃。曼徹斯特警方周五公布，其中一名死者驗屍後發現有與槍傷相符的傷口，由於疑兇沒有持槍，而現場只有警員曾開槍，警方形容傷勢可能是警員為迅速制止襲擊所導致的不幸意外，另外亦有一名正留醫的傷者身上發現非致命的槍傷，推斷兩人案發時身處教堂門後，試圖阻擋疑兇進入並遭擊中。

                                
                            
                            
                            
                        
                    
                        
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                
而襲擊案當晚，倫敦白廳有大批民眾示威，要求以色列釋放打算進入加沙的國際人道救援船隊，並聲援巴勒斯坦人。示威其後隨民眾湧出馬路，演變成警民衝突。倫敦警察廳公布拘捕了40人。

                                
                            
                            
                            
                        
                    
                        
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                
內政大臣馬曼婷接受英國天空新聞專訪時表示對示威感到失望，強調英國法律不會容忍任何涉及種族仇恨的行為。

                                
                            
                            
                            
                        
                    
                        
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                
英國內政大臣馬曼婷：「我認為這種行為從根本上非英國精神，我認為令人蒙羞。我們絕不容忍任何針對猶太社區、基於中東局勢而產生的敵意。」

                                
                            
                            
                            
                        
                    
                        
                        
                        
                            
                                
                                
英國一個組織周末將舉辦示威活動，聲援被英國當局列為恐怖組織的「巴勒斯坦行動」，預料有過千人參與。倫敦警察廳不希望抽走原本保障社區安全的警力去維持示威秩序，呼籲活動延期或取消，但該組織已表明不予理會。]]></content>

Japanese restaurants, bars and stores are running low on beer and other beverages from industry leader Asahi Group as the impact from a cyberattack entered a fifth day on Friday, with no resolution in sight.
Known for its Super Dry beer and Nikka Whisky as well as non-alcoholic beverages, Asahi suspended operations in Japan on Monday, including order processing, shipping and call center functions after a cyberattack caused a system outage.

The company began processing orders for some products on Wednesday by visiting customers in person and handwriting orders, it said. While it continues to take orders for food and soft drinks, it has not taken further orders for alcoholic beverages to prioritize outgoing shipments, which began on Friday for the first batch of manually filled orders, it said.

Full recovery not in sight yet

In updating its emergency responses, Asahi announced on Friday evening that ransomware attacks on company servers had been confirmed, and that it aimed to restart call center operations to handle phone enquiries from customers next week.
Asahi is working with outside specialists to restore its computer system, but it is unclear how soon the company can resume full operations, it said.
Asahi also said it was looking into the potential impact on its earnings.
The breach is the latest in a string of cyber and ransomware attacks targeting global companies.

In Britain, luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover was forced to shut down its factories last month, while Marks & Spencer and the Co-op Group have also fallen victim to sophisticated breaches.
On Friday in Tokyo, one eatery that normally only serves Asahi-branded beer said it was on its last keg of Asahi Super Dry, and that its supplier brought beer from rival Sapporo a day earlier, citing the shortage.
"It's a bit of a problem," said Tomiko Yano, a chef at restaurant Kushiyaki Tosaka. "We specialise in yakitori (skewered chicken) and it pairs really well with Super Dry. A lot of customers say that, so I'm a little worried (about the shortage)."
Convenience store operator Lawson said it was expecting a shortage of Asahi products soon and it was making preparations to sell alternative products. FamilyMart and 7-Eleven also said they were affected.
Asahi's shares have fallen about 4% to their lowest level since February after the company said it was attacked.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[教育局公布優化高中中史和歷史科課程框架，計劃2027/28學年起在中四推行。

教育局向學校發出通函，公布優化高中中史及歷史科課程框架，中史科必修部分，古代史及現代史各分五個時期，其中近代史加入「中國共產黨成立」、「中國特色社會主義新時代」等課題，選修單元就由六個減至三個。

歷史科必修部分，分為三個單元，其中一個單元涵蓋內容是「中國與世界」，包括認識中國特色大國外交、構建人類命運共同體的理念等，也重設選修部分，兩個單元二選一。

當局指，現行課程已實施逾16年，有必要檢視更新。新課程將於2027/28學年在中四級全面推行，適用於2030年及以後的香港中學文憑試。

有教育界人士認為，局方應進一步考慮將中史科列為高中免考核的必修科。

教育評議會會長何漢權說：「國民教育根本是國史教育，如果在這個大前提下，確確實實，高中中國歷史科(選修學生)一定要提量提質，或者他覺得，優化課程後很不錯，可能有部分，三、四成甚至五成人，是否可選擇獨立必修，不需要考試，一周一課，輕鬆學中國歷史科。」

教育局局長蔡若蓮在社交平台發文，指兩科的優化課程以現行課程為基礎，平衡並突顯兩科的互補特色，培養具備愛國精神和世界觀的人才，局方將舉辦課程簡介會，闡釋優化課程理念和收集意見。]]></content>

With a Georgetown University degree and several internships under her belt, Christina Salvadore thought she'd be starting a career in New York City's fashion or beauty industries around now. The problem: She can't find a job.
The 23-year-old hasn't been able to land a full-time role despite filling out hundreds of applications and taking dozens of networking calls since graduating in the spring. She's currently applying to part-time gigs to tide her over financially.

"It definitely sucks when people are like, 'So what are you doing now?,'" Salvadore, a Florida native, told CNBC. "I'm sitting in my parents' house on LinkedIn 24 hours a day."
A growing body of data shows Salvadore isn't alone. Young college grads are having a uniquely difficult time trying to clinch their first full-time jobs and feeling the brunt of the weakening labor market.
On a macro level, this group's tough luck is moving the needle in broader data sets that are used in part by economists and monetary policymakers to determine the health of the economy. For the hundreds of thousands of Americans in this camp, it's altering their visions for what they thought this era of life would look like.


The unemployment rate for "new entrants," a group that includes new college grads and others trying to break in to the full-time workforce, hit a nine-year peak this year, federal data shows. The group's share of the total unemployed population spiked to its highest percentage in decades.
Put simply: The U.S. has become "no country for young grads," according to Gad Levanon, chief economist at Burning Glass Institute, and his team at the labor-focused think tank.


An 'unusual' trend

In a report published this summer, Levanon and his team found that the bachelor's degree isn't delivering on its "fundamental promise" of access to white-collar jobs for the first time in modern history. The once-lauded path from college campus to career, the team concluded, is increasingly less reliable.
After Levanon fielded questions about whether the trend was affecting all young workers or just those with college diplomas, he conducted further analysis of federal data. It shows 20- to 24-year-olds with bachelor's degrees have seen the most extreme levels of unemployment compared with historical levels than other educational groups.



Bachelor's degree holders in this age bracket have long benefited from a lower unemployment rate compared with those with just high school diplomas. But Levanon's data shows the gap between the two groups is the smallest it has been since at least the early 2000s.
"You clearly see here something unusual for the bachelor's degree," Levanon told CNBC.


On popular social media platform TikTok, young adults fresh out of college have made the trials and tribulations associated with finding their first post-grad job a sort of subgenre. They're documenting the journey and lamenting the discouragement they feel. They're moving home with their parents. They're questioning why entry-level job postings require several years of experience. They're wondering why companies "ghost" them, meaning they never get a response to an application.
Several have used the slang phrase "crashing out" to describe how they're faring emotionally.
"I feel like I'm behind right now," said recent Boston College grad Michael Hartman, who said he recently sought insight from a psychic about his career trajectory after around 10 months of unsuccessful job hunting. Hartman has an economics degree and has been seeking a consulting or business strategy role.

'Very stressful'

This turn of fortune for America's newest college grads has caught the attention of top economic policymakers and comes amid mounting concerns about the labor market at large.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged a few weeks ago that young people are having a harder time locking down work. He pointed to a "low-firing, low-hiring environment," a landscape that economists have said makes it particularly tough for those looking to break into the full-time workforce.
The number of workers getting hired and quitting slowed in August, according to government data released Tuesday. Figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released in September show the number of people staying unemployed for at least 27 weeks has ballooned around 25% year over year on a seasonally adjusted basis. Federal labor data previously expected to be released this week is on hold for the duration of the government shutdown.

Burning Glass' Levanon said the problem stems in part from the rising share of young Americans obtaining four-year degrees. The demand for workers with this education level isn't keeping up, he said, meaning current conditions may not improve anytime soon.
This could result in a hit to college enrollment as young people realize higher education is not the career pipeline it once was, Levanon added.

On top of that, the rise of artificial intelligence has raised alarms that entry-level, knowledge-worker roles will be automated away.
In August, Stanford published a bombshell study finding U.S. workers ages 22 to 25 in jobs most exposed to AI have seen a 13% decline in employment since 2022. Anecdotally, executives at companies ranging from Walmart to Accenture have said the technology will drastically reshape their labor forces.
Tightening in the labor market has made an entire generation more worried about what the future will hold. Reported probability of losing a job over the next five years among 18- to 34-year-olds in May jumped to highs last seen in 2013, according to University of Michigan data.


These concerns have changed the outlook for recent and soon-to-be college grads alike. After seeing friends struggle to secure employment, student Emma Zatkulak began firing off applications several weeks earlier than she previously anticipated. The 21-year-old finds herself scheduling interviews for sales and insurance roles in between a full class load and two jobs.
"It's been very stressful," said Zatkulak, who is in her final semester as a communications major at Boise State University in Idaho. "I have not felt calm in a couple months."

A 'real phenomenon'

However, not all new grads may be feeling this shift to the same extent.
On job board Indeed, software development job listings are at around 66% of the volume seen before the Covid pandemic. On the other hand, nursing position postings are up about 16% compared with the same baseline.
"It's a real phenomenon," said Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America. "But at the same time, I do not think it applies to all students or all young people. It depends on what sector they're working in."


Still, Ullrich acknowledged that there's reason for young adults' anxiety. She pointed to an analysis by Moody's Analytics that found fewer tracked industries have added jobs over the last six months than removed them, which has historically only happened during and around recessions.
In the technology industry, the decline in entry-level hiring is particularly clear. The number of hires with little work experience has plunged more than 50% at large-cap tech companies between 2019 and 2024, according to venture capital firm SignalFire. At startups, that number has dropped more than 47%.


Young job seekers told CNBC that the difficulty of finding a job has brought up feelings of social isolation and self-doubt. As rejections pile up, they said it can become hard not to take it personally.
Over recent months, Julia Vasedkova has watched fellow graduates from Tennessee's Rhodes College start their new lives as young professionals. Meanwhile, Vasedkova has been in a state of self-described "limbo" with only a part-time job, despite sending off hundreds of applications. The English major has applied for teaching, publishing and social media positions.
The 24-year-old finds herself turning down invitations for social gatherings to conserve money for rent and other expenses. It's also time that she could be spending trying to find the increasingly elusive post-grad job, anyway.
"It's definitely exhausting. Some days, it feels like I have a full-time job just to apply for jobs," Vasedkova said. "It just feels like I don't really have a life outside of that."

The much-needed modernization of the U.S. Army's battlefield communications network being undertaken by Anduril, Palantir and others is rife with "fundamental security" problems and vulnerabilities, and should be treated as a "very high risk," according to a recent internal Army memo.
The two Silicon Valley companies, led by allies of U.S. President Donald Trump, have gained access to the Pentagon's lucrative flow of contracts on the promise of quickly providing less expensive and more sophisticated weapons than the Pentagon's longstanding arms providers.

But the September memo from the Army's chief technology officer about the NGC2 platform that connects soldiers, sensors, vehicles and commanders with real-time data paints a bleak picture of the initial product.
"We cannot control who sees what, we cannot see what users are doing, and we cannot verify that the software itself is secure," the memo says.
Palantir and Anduril did not comment for this story.
The assessment, seen by Reuters and first reported by Breaking Defense, comes just months after defense drone and software maker Anduril was awarded a $100 million to create a prototype of NGC2 with partners including Palantir, Microsoft and several smaller contractors.
The Army should treat the NGC2 prototype version as “very high risk” because of the “likelihood of an adversary gaining persistent undetectable access," wrote Gabrielle Chiulli, the Army chief technology officer authorizing official.

Despite the early September memo's scathing critique, Leonel Garciga, Army chief information officer and Chiulli's supervisor, said in a statement to Reuters that the report was part of a process that helped in "triaging cybersecurity vulnerabilities" and mitigating them.
In March, the 4th Infantry Division used the system in live-fire artillery training at Fort Carson, Colorado, in an exercise Anduril described as demonstrating faster and more reliable performance than legacy systems.
The Army memo identifies some major security gaps.
The report says the system allows any authorized user to access all applications and data regardless of their clearance level or operational need. As a result, "Any user can potentially access and misuse sensitive" classified information, the memo states, with no logging to track their actions.
Other deficiencies highlighted in the memo include the hosting of third-party applications that have not undergone Army security assessments. One application revealed 25 high-severity code vulnerabilities. Three additional applications under review each contain over 200 vulnerabilities requiring assessment, according to the document.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[当前加沙地带局势几乎呈现无解状态。以色列与哈马斯之间的尖锐政治对立，以及对未来加沙地区政治与安全格局的根本分歧，决定了双方只能在短期内达成有限性的和解，难以在长期层面实现持久和平。
王晋
责任编辑：辛省志
在加沙地带军事冲突接近两周年之际，美国总统特朗普最终提出了新的停火方案，即所谓的中东和平“二十点计划”。按照该计划，以色列和哈马斯均需作出一定让步，美国与阿拉伯国家则通过外交努力推动停火早日达成，并启动战后加沙的人道主义救助与经济重建。值得注意的是，美国在该方案中也展现出一定的政策调整，例如不再强调“清空加沙”以及不再要求当地民众强制迁移。在美国压力之下，以色列似乎表现出相对更大的妥协态度，从而使停火的可能性再度浮现。
以色列国内结束战争的诉求逐渐强化
美国所提出的“二十点计划”，是在美国总统特朗普和以色列总理内塔尼亚胡会面之后做出的。之所以美国此次下定决心推动停火，并且得到了以色列的配合，是由美国和以色列面临的一系列变化所推动的。
在过去两个月中，以色列国内舆论呈现出新的变化特征。尽管多数民众仍然倾向于支持在加沙地带继续进行军事行动，但社会内部关于战争能否有效实现既定战略目标的质疑日益增加。越来越多的以色列公众开始强调调整战略与战术路径的必要性，尤其是将尽快解救被哈马斯扣押的人员视为首要的战争目标。相关民调结果印证了这一趋势：根据以色列权威机构在2025年9月公布的数据，有“64%–70%”的受访者表示支持接受一项能够确保所有人质获释并结束战争的协议。这一结果说明，国内对于结束战争的诉求正在逐渐强化。长期军事消耗以及由此带来的军民伤亡，进一步推动了社会内部的反思与对尽快止战的呼声。在这一背景下，以色列政府被迫重新审视其在加沙地带的作战目标，在2025年8月安全内阁的决策中，将原计划在加沙地带全境发动新一轮攻击，调整为攻占加沙北部中心城市加沙城，即可

朝日集团一名发言人3日说，黑客攻击动机仍在调查中，但集团员工1日起以手动录入信息的方式完成一些紧急订单发货。

            
目前，朝日集团仍接收食品和软饮料订单，但为优先保障货物出库，已暂停接受酒精饮料新订单。

据日本媒体报道，受此影响，日本一些便利店朝日产品库存紧张，甚至断货。罗森便利连锁公司表示，预计店内朝日产品将很快出现短缺，准备推出替代产品。东京一家7-11便利店的店员说，店内仍有朝日啤酒库存，但即将售罄。
一些餐饮店也受到影响。“这确实有点麻烦，”烧鸟店厨师矢野富子说，“我们主打烤鸡肉串，很多顾客说这道菜适合搭配啤酒，所以我对断货有些担心。”
朝日集团表示，已取消多项推广活动并推迟发售新品，目前尚不清楚系统何时能恢复正常运行。一些日本媒体报道，朝日集团可能遭勒索病毒攻击，但该集团拒绝置评。遭网络攻击以来，朝日集团股价已下跌约4%，跌至2月以来最低水平。
近期，多个知名企业遭到网络攻击，包括英国哈罗德百货和玛莎百货公司，造成正常业务停滞。]]></content>

A huge fire broke out on Thursday night at a Chevron oil refinery in California, one of the largest on the U.S. west coast, following reports of an explosion.
No injuries were reported from the incident at the El Segundo plant, Chevron said on Friday, with the U.S. energy major's fire department personnel and emergency services "actively responding" to the situation.

It was not immediately clear what caused the blaze.
"All refinery personnel and contractors have been accounted for and there are no injuries," Chevron said in a statement, according to NBC.
"No evacuation orders for area residents have been put in place by emergency response agencies monitoring the incident, and no exceedances have been detected by the facilities fence line monitoring system," the company added.
The El Segundo oil refinery is capable of refining 290,000 barrels of crude oil per day, Chevron says on its website, and its primary products are gasoline, jet and diesel.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[獲批准「港車北上」的車輛，本月13日起，毋須申請俗稱「禁區紙」的封閉道路通行許可證。有汽車業界人士相信，是為年底「粵車南下」做準備。

現時「港車北上」車輛駛經指定路段，要提前申請俗稱「禁區紙」的封閉道路許可證，並在車輛擋風玻璃上展示，才可以出行。

申請許可證需時約兩周，有效期一年，每次申請540港元，如有遺失要再續領。

由本月13日起，「港車北上」車主只需下載申請計劃時，運輸署發出的「電子批准信」，毋須再申請許可證，車輛就可駛經港珠澳大橋香港連接路，與順朗路、赤鱲角路、屯赤隧道公路等路段。

相關安排亦會在本月20日，擴展至另外兩個跨境駕駛計劃，包括「港珠澳大橋澳門口岸泊車轉乘計劃」，和「深圳灣一次性特別配額計劃」，涵蓋深圳灣口岸與廈村交匯處起的支路，及港深西部公路路段。

運輸署指，新安排有助便利跨境出行，提高效率，預計逾10萬輛合資格車輛受惠。

香港汽車工業學會榮譽會長李耀培說：「我們覺得這次可能來說『港車北上』，我們取消(許可證)，和試行一段時間、可行的方法，有機會『粵車南下』的朋友或車，亦可能會取消這個『禁區紙』，這樣大家就方便很多。」

運輸署強調，特區政府與廣東省政府持續優化「港車北上」安排，進一步善用港珠澳大橋的承載力，促進粵港澳大灣區融合發展。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[IT之家 10 月 3 日消息，科技媒体 MacWorld 今天发布博文，探访苹果 Apple Music 洛杉矶录音室大楼，内部充满“果味”，苹果员工和合作音乐人将在这里一站式完成 Apple Music 全流程创作。

据介绍，该录音室占地面积超 15000 平方呎（IT之家注：约 1394 平方米），参观行程从门口的两个“绿屋”开始，该空间布置有沙发、桌子，可让艺人登上 Apple Music 电台之前休息，也可以在这里拍摄社交媒体照片，每个房间墙上都挂满了艺人照片，装饰比较独特。
苹果还在大楼内设置了专业摄影棚，用于拍摄专辑封面等宣传内容，配有专业的相机和灯光，还专门布置了几台 Mac Studio 主机和 ProDisplay XDR 显示器，能让艺人们不出大楼就能直接完成拍照、修图等流程。

大楼内还拥有两间顶尖的电台录音室，可随意转换为直播间、播客间、访谈空间或小型表演舞台，整体设计极具未来感，中间是一张摆满电台设备的桌子，前方则是一张大沙发，对面整面墙都是超高分辨率的显示屏，内部安装了多台摄影机，可从不同角度录制节目，制作水准“堪比好莱坞”。

值得注意的是，录音室内的所有麦克风都是定制款式，机身上印有“Apple Music”标志，同时麦克风的机械臂调节支架长得很像“台灯电脑”iMac G4。紧挨着录音室的是导播室，配有多台显示器和切换器，桌子看起来、摸起来都很像 Apple Store 直营店“同款”，可以将各种设备隐藏在桌子中间。


最令人惊叹的还是空间音频混音室，里面配有 9.2.4 PMC 扬声器系统，可让人仿佛置身在音乐之中，整套系统由两台苹果芯片的 Mac Pro 台式电脑驱动，同时可以看到混音台采用了“混合设计”，上半部分是屏幕显示出的虚拟音频条，下半部分则是真实的推子。


不过遗憾的是，目前这栋大楼并未向公众开放，只有少数苹果员工和合作艺人才能进入这里。]]></content>

TURIN, Italy — Artificial intelligence is currently in an "industrial bubble" but the technology is "real" and will bring big benefits to society, Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos said on Friday.
The term bubble usually refers to a period of inflated stock prices or valuations of companies that have disconnected from the fundamentals of a business. One of the most famous bubbles that burst was the 2000 dotcom crash where the value of internet companies plummeted.

Exor CEO John Elkann asked Bezos on stage at Italian Tech Week in Turin, Italy whether there were signs that the current AI industry is in bubble.
"This is a kind of industrial bubble," the Amazon founder said.
Bezos laid out some of the key characteristics of bubbles, noting that when they happen, stock prices are "disconnected from the fundamentals" of a business.
"The second thing that happens is that people get very excited like they are today about artificial intelligence," Bezos added.
During bubbles, every experiment or idea gets funded, he told the audience.

"The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and the bad ideas. And that's also probably happening today," Bezos said.

"But that doesn't mean anything that is happening isn't real. AI is real, and it is going to change every industry."
Bezos gave the example of a six-person company receiving billions of dollars of funding. This is "very unusual behavior" and yet this kind of activity is happening today, he said without making it clear what company he was referring to.
The billionaire however, said that ultimately industrial bubbles could be positive. He pointed to the biotech and pharmaceutical company bubble in the 1990s, which led to the development of some life-saving drugs even though many companies eventually went bust.
"The [bubbles] that are industrial are not nearly as bad, it can even be good, because when the dust settles and you see who are the winners, societies benefits from those inventions," Bezos said.
"That is what is going to happen here too. This is real, the benefits to society from AI are going to be gigantic."

AI bubble warnings grow

Bezos is not the only major business figure warning about an AI bubble. In August, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly said the AI market is in a bubble, and many investors have also raised the issue.
Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon on Friday expressed some concerns about stock market levels amid the AI hype.
"When [investors are] excited, they tend to think about the good things that can go right, and they diminish the things you should be skeptical about that can go wrong ... There will be a reset, there will be a check at some point, there will be a drawdown," Solomon said at Italian Tech Week. "The extent of that will depend on how long this [bull run] goes."
Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer of equities at Selwood Asset Management, said last week that the "AI trade is beginning to resemble one of the great speculative manias of market history."

OpenAI now has two of the top three free apps in Apple's App Store, and its new video generation app Sora has snagged the coveted No. 1 spot.
The artificial intelligence startup launched Sora on Tuesday, and it allows users to generate short-form AI videos, remix videos created by other users and post them to a shared feed. Sora is only available on iOS devices and is invite-based, which means users need a code to access it.

Despite these restrictions, Sora has secured the top spot in the App Store, ahead of Google's Gemini and OpenAI's generative chatbot ChatGPT.
"It's been epic to see what the collective creativity of humanity is capable of so far," Bill Peebles, head of Sora at OpenAI, wrote in a post on X on Friday. "Team is iterating fast and listening to feedback."

Sora is powered by OpenAI's latest video and audio generation model called Sora 2. OpenAI said the model is capable of creating scenes and sounds with "a high degree of realism," according to a blog post. The startup's first video and audio generation model, Sora, was announced in February 2024.
OpenAI said it has taken steps to address potential safety concerns around the Sora app, including giving users explicit control over how their likeness is used on the platform. But some of the initial videos posted to the app, including one that depicts OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shoplifting, have sparked debates about its utility, potential for harm and legality.
"It is easy to imagine the degenerate case of AI video generation that ends up with us all being sucked into an RL-optimized slop feed," Altman wrote in a post on X on Tuesday. "The team has put great care and thought into trying to figure out how to make a delightful product that doesn't fall into that trap, and has come up with a number of promising ideas."

OpenAI's Sora 2 sparks AI 'slop' backlash
TechCheck




Fresh off a $6.6 billion share sale that made it the world's most valuable private company, OpenAI's TikTok-style video app, powered by its new artificial intelligence model, Sora 2, is going viral.
Despite the gated release that requires an invite code, the video creation tool has already shot to the top of Apple's App Store and sparked a wave of deepfakes, including a viral clip of CEO Sam Altman shoplifting GPUs.

Internally, the rollout has reignited a long-running debate inside OpenAI about how to balance safety with creative freedom.
A person familiar with internal strategy at the company said leadership views strict guardrails as essential, but also worries about stifling creativity or being perceived as censoring too much.
That tension remains unresolved.
OpenAI's culture has long favored speed, often shipping new tools ahead of rivals and letting the public adapt in real time.
One former employee, who asked not to be named to discuss internal matters, told CNBC that during their tenure, OpenAI leadership had a pattern of prioritizing fast launches. That strategy was on full display after China's DeepSeek released a powerful model at the end of last year that was cheaper and faster to build than anything out of Silicon Valley.

OpenAI responded within weeks, debuting two new models in what was widely viewed as a defensive move to preserve its lead.
But OpenAI has a key advantage: Its growing institutional muscle.
Once a scrappy research lab in San Francisco's Mission District, the company has since become more structured, enabling it to spin up cross-functional teams more quickly and accelerate the development and deployment cycles for products like Sora.

OpenAI said Sora includes multiple layers of safeguards meant to prevent unsafe content from being generated, using prompt filtering and output moderation across video frames and audio transcripts. It bans explicit content, terrorist propaganda, and material promoting self-harm. The app also uses watermarks and bans likeness impersonation.
But some users have already found ways to skirt those protections.
Sora 2, the AI model powering OpenAI's app, is a sharp improvement over the first version. The new system generates longer, more coherent clips that look strikingly real.
Multiple viral videos feature Altman after he granted permission for his likeness to be used on the platform, while others depict popular cartoon characters like Pikachu and SpongeBob SquarePants in unsettling roles.
The content has fueled criticism that OpenAI is once again moving faster than its own guardrails. Its use of copyrighted material — unless rights holders opt out — is consistent with the company's current policy, though that approach is being challenged in court.
Altman has brushed off concerns, saying in a post on X that Sora is as much about transparency — showing the public what the technology can do — as it is about building commercial momentum to fund OpenAI's broader ambitions around artificial general intelligence.
The launch comes amid intensifying competition. Meta rolled out Vibes last week, a new short-form AI video feed inside its Meta AI app. Google has Veo 3, while ByteDance and Alibaba have also debuted rival systems.
OpenAI, meanwhile, just committed to fresh spending of $850 billion, deepening its push into infrastructure and next-gen models.

Experts say the push into video isn't just about drawing more users into the ecosystem with another sticky consumer app.
Professor Hao Li, a leading expert in video synthesis, told CNBC that most AI systems today are still trained on linguistic data like books and internet text. But to move toward general intelligence, he said, models need to learn from visual and audio information, much like a baby discovers the world through sight.
"We use AI to generate content to then train another model to perform better," he said.
Li added that his lab already uses AI-generated video to enhance model performance, feeding synthetic data back into the system.
It's part of a broader trend among researchers who see video generation as a way to simulate reality and help models reason more like humans.
Former OpenAI executive Zack Kass, whose forthcoming book "The Next Renaissance: AI and the Expansion of Human Potential" explores the societal implications of artificial intelligence, echoed that view.
On the broader question of how model makers should approach deployment, Kass argued that the trade-offs of releasing powerful technology early are worth it.
"There are two alternatives to building in the open: Not building at all, or building privately. And those alternatives, to me, are worse," he told CNBC. "If we have a groundbreaking technology, I think people should know about it and use it so that we can all update to it."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The disruption comes as Munich hosts its world-famous Oktoberfest beer festival, which runs until Sunday. Last week, Denmark and Norway closed airports due to drones.
    Germany's interior minister said the temporary closure of Munich airport after drone sightings was a 'wake-up call' Image: Ayhan Uyanik/REUTERS   
Munich Airport said early on Friday that drone sightings on Thursday evening had forced air traffic control to halt operations. An airport spokesperson later said operations resumed as of 5 a.m. local time (0300 UTC/GMT).
"Passengers who were affected by the closure yesterday have been booked on new flights and flights cancelled yesterday will be rescheduled for today," a spokesperson told the AFP news agency.
A Lufthansa spokesperson said, "Flight operations have since resumed according to schedule."

What was the disruption at Munich airport?
The drone sighting prompted the cancellation of more than 30 flights, disrupting travel for nearly 3,000 passengers at the airport in the southern German state of Bavaria.
German police said the airport's runways were closed late in the evening as a precaution. 
Police officers searched the area for suspicious individuals but found nothing. A police helicopter was also deployed.


German interior minister says drone sightings a 'wake-up call'
German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt told the mass-market daily Bild that the drone incident in Munich was a "wake-up call."
"The drone sightings over Munich are another wake-up call: The race between drone threats and drone defense is becoming increasingly fierce," Dobrindt told the country's largest circulation publication.
"We now need more funding, support, and research — nationally and at the European level," he added.

Dobrindt said a meeting of European Union interior ministers on Saturday would also address anti-drone defenses.
"At the meeting of European interior ministers this weekend in Munich, we will, in addition to the migration issues, also
explicitly address the situation of drones and the threat posed by drones," he told reporters.
Bavarian Premier Markus Söder called for allowing his state's police force to quickly shoot down drones, a step some experts warned against as it could lead to dangerous debris in civilian areas. 
German authorities have launched a search to identify the origin of the drone or drones.
Recent airport closures in Denmark and Norway
The development comes after sightings temporarily shut airports in Denmark and Norway last week.
The incident comes as Germany's Oktoberfest, which draws hundreds of thousands of people every day to Munich, is approaching its final weekend.

It remains unclear who is behind the drone flights, but there is speculation that Russia may be involved. Moscow has rejected the allegations.

Electronic shelf labels, digital screens that display the price of an item, are replacing traditional paper price tags in grocery stores across America.
The technology can already be found at Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and Kroger, along with stores in Canada, Europe, Asia and other regions. Electronic shelf labels are expected to become more common: The global market for the products was estimated at $1.85 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $7.54 billion by 2033, according to Grand View Research.

"It's definitely an industry that is looking at significant double-digit year-over-year growth for the foreseeable future," said Cullen Hendrix, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
Walmart, the largest U.S. retailer, has said it plans to roll out electronic shelf labels to 2,300 stores by 2026. The company said the technology allows employees to update shelf prices using a mobile app, reducing a price change that typically takes an associate two days to a matter of minutes.
"The only impediment to how quickly they can change prices at this point is how long it takes the human in the loop to decide to change the prices," said Hendrix.
But some lawmakers fear that electronic shelf labels could enable grocery stores to raise prices during periods of high demand.
"Digital price tags may enable Kroger and other grocery chains to transition to 'dynamic pricing,' in which the price of basic household goods could surge based on the time of day, the weather, or other transitory events — allowing stores to calibrate price increases to extract maximum profits," Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and then-Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., wrote in an August 2024 letter to Kroger's then-chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen.

"To be clear, Kroger does not and has never engaged in 'surge pricing,'" Kroger said in a response letter. [The labels] provide us with operational data to better manage inventory. Those insights allow us to pinpoint opportunities where we can lower prices on items that are perishable, seasonally specific or which otherwise need to move more quickly, including key staples."
Dynamic pricing reduces food waste by up to 21%, according to a study from the University of California, San Diego's Rady School of Management that was last revised in December 2023.
Ioannis Stamatopoulos, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the researchers behind a separate study on the topic published in June, said "the facts show there is no surge pricing currently occurring."
"The basic economics of grocery retail is that they want to acquire customers and retain customers," Stamatopoulos said. "It's silly of them to risk upsetting you over gaining a few extra cents on an ice cream when it's hot outside."
Amazon said it has "no plans to utilize surge or dynamic pricing." Amazon-owned Whole Foods declined to comment.
Walmart did not respond to CNBC's request for comment in time for publication.

Android Authority 将 6.48 版本的谷歌相册 App 进行 APK 安装包拆解，发现该版本的 AI 图生视频功能新增了一个提示词输入框，当用户选择图片并打开“图片转视频”功能时，该提示框会自动出现在屏幕底部，允许用户自己输入提示词，直接按用户指定的命令生成视频。

作为比较，目前谷歌相册 App 中相关功能只有两个选项，分别是“添加轻微动作”（为人物添加轻微的动作）和“手气不错”（IT之家注：随机生成视频），用户不太能自己掌控内容生成方向，很多时候只能一遍遍随缘点击“手气不错”来慢慢碰运气。
谷歌相册的“AI 图生视频”功能最初发布于今年 7 月，可利用 Veo 2 模型将用户提供的照片转化为 6 秒的短视频，后续谷歌将模型升级为 Veo 3，生成出的视频画质更高，且可以更改横屏 / 竖屏。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[簽約儀式由亞昕集團董事長姚政岳（左）與中興大學副校長蔡清標（右）主持。記者宋健生／攝影
                
                
亞昕（5213）集團董事長姚政岳3日表示，目前國內房地產景氣仍不明朗，市場多呈個案表現，不過亞昕仍對台中充滿信心，目前計有水湳經貿園區、科博館特區等4案正申請建照之中，合計總銷逾430億元案量「準備好了」，將伺機進場。


姚政岳表示，現階段整體房市景氣仍不明朗，「政府水龍頭不開大一點，換屋族根本出不來」他建議政府，應該要調降銀行存準率，及放鬆對銀行不動產放款集中度的管制措施，擴大貨幣供給量，及讓銀行在不動產放款的占比上享有更多彈性。

.article-content__abbr__text {display:inline-block;} /* to be remove */




  










對於台中房市，姚政岳並不悲觀。他指出，以南屯區的「亞昕織御」為例，開案一個月就賣了兩成，成交單價已站上7字頭，其中已購客戶中，有近八成為看長線的置產客，完全沒有短期投資客。「亞昕織御」共規劃300餘戶住宅，總銷72億元。


至於推案規劃，目前已申請建照的建案，計有水湳「文商段案」，總銷130億元；北屯崇德段「亞昕嶼森之嶼」，總銷40億元；北屯都更案「大連路案」，總銷300億元（亞昕約占185億元）；西屯科博館都更案「麻園頭案」，總銷80億元。4案合計總銷達435億元。


為應對全球化浪潮下營建產業的人才需求，並為集團的永續經營布局，亞昕集團今日與國立中興大學簽約推動產學合作，宣布攜手中興大學成立全國首創的「土木工程國際專班」。


簽約儀式由姚政岳與中興大學副校長蔡清標主持，包括副校長暨國際長周濟眾、工學院長楊明德、研發長宋振銘、土木系主任余志鵬、專班負責人熊彬成教授等人共同見證，


姚政岳表示，此一前瞻性的產學合作計畫，不僅是亞昕集團國際化戰略的延伸，更彰顯了集團「根本從教育做起」的深層理念，從源頭培育產業未來新血的決心。


亞昕集團深耕台灣營建市場逾30年，從早期的住宅建案開發，到近年來積極拓展飯店、商辦地產等多元化產品線，始終秉持「品質第一、日系精工」的經營理念。


亞昕集團早在15年前即開始布局海外市場，目前在馬來西亞已成為當地重要國際開發商。集團在馬六甲市中心擁有多項大型綜合開發案，包括高端住宅、商場大樓，以及備受矚目的國際級五星飯店項目。


值得一提的是，亞昕集團在馬來西亞投資興建的豪華度假飯店，不僅成為當地的地標建築，更榮獲多項國際建築獎項的肯定，充分展現亞昕集團在跨國營建項目上的實力。


宋振銘表示，中興大學將為專班學生量身打造完整的國際化職涯發展路徑，此專班的課程設計完全以國際化為導向，主要特色包括：全程英語授課，接軌國際標準。


同時導入亞昕集團在馬來西亞飯店項目的實際案例，安排學生進行海外實習，深度體驗國際化營建環境；學生的論文主題須由教授與合作企業亞昕集團共同討論決定，碩班第二年亦安排業界實習，深化對產業實務的理解與掌握。


近年來，台灣土木工程領域普遍面臨人才斷層的困境，年輕學子因傳統印象中的辛勞工作環境而卻步。亞昕集團洞察此趨勢，深知企業的永續發展繫於人才的持續投入。


為此，亞昕集團積極推動「國際產業人才教育專班」政策，除了配合教育部學費補貼政策之外，更獨家提供學生所需的生活費補貼、零用錢以及宿舍住宿費，讓來自世界各地的國際學生，能夠無後顧之憂地專心學習。


更重要的是，表現優秀的學生，將前往亞昕集團在馬來西亞的飯店及台灣建案進行實習，親身體驗國際化營建項目的運作模式。畢業後，還可直接進入亞昕集團工作，享有優於市場行情的薪資待遇，並擁有輪調至海外據點工作的優先機會。

冯德莱恩表示，车企们应该在欧洲范围全力探索自动驾驶汽车领域，振兴当今陷入困境的欧洲车企，还有助于提升道路安全；还呼吁欧盟的战略性企业优先走向“人工智能优先”战略，带动 AI 产业发展，重点应关注流动性。

她还表示：“中国和美国已经将自动驾驶汽车化为现实，欧洲也应当如此，为此我们计划在欧洲某个城市建设自动驾驶汽车试点区域，目前已有 60 位意大利市长有意向参与，我相信这些东西终将变成现实”。
同时冯德莱恩认为，整个欧洲的汽车产业拥有数百万名劳动力，他们之中的某些人在脱碳化和数字化的浪潮下被迫失业，但 AI 似乎能改变这一局面，至少能缓解交通拥堵、帮助保护就业，还能让偏远地区更快地连接市中心，减缓发展不均衡现象。
IT之家注：都灵是意大利北部的重要工业城市，号称是“意大利的底特律”，是汽车品牌菲亚特、蓝旗亚和阿尔法・罗密欧的总部所在地，举办过 2006 年冬季奥运会。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[新华社俄罗斯索契10月3日电（记者栾海 郝建伟）俄罗斯总统普京2日在俄西南部城市索契表示，中方提出的全球治理倡议“与我们的欧亚安全构想密切关联”，就此进行“对表”具有双边性和全球性，因而非常重要。
普京当天出席俄智库瓦尔代国际辩论俱乐部第22届年会全体会议时说，俄方高度评价这类“对表”结果，这是俄中关系向前发展迈出的正确步伐。
普京说，俄中两国元首相互出席对方国家举办的纪念世界反法西斯战争胜利庆典，意义非凡。通过抗击纳粹和并肩消灭日本军国主义，俄中两国付出了巨大牺牲，共同作出了重大贡献。在庆典活动期间，俄中元首讨论国际形势，探讨两国在经济、文化和教育等领域发展双边关系。

            
2024至2025年是“中俄文化年”。普京表示，俄中愿共同开展青年工作，着眼未来。谈及中国对俄公民试行免签政策，他表示自己说过将对中方实行对等政策，俄方将尽力推动这一进程。
据俄媒报道，普京2024年2月在向议会两院发表国情咨文时提出，美国及其附庸国的行动导致欧洲安全体系瓦解，俄应提出在欧亚大陆建立平等且不可分割的安全体系构想。此后俄方曾表示，俄准备与金砖国家和上合组织国家合作，构建新的欧亚安全架构；建立欧亚安全新体系可以是多边互动模式，其中可包括欧亚经济联盟、集体安全条约组织和有志加入的亚欧、欧洲国家。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[My top 10 things to watch Friday, Oct. 3 1. Boeing problems: The planemaker's new 777X widebody jet is now set to make its commercial debut in early 2027 instead of next year, Bloomberg reported this morning. That delay could expose Club name Boeing to sizable non-cash accounting charges. Safety certification work is taking longer than expected. 2. BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners is seemingly negotiating to buy everything. This time, GIP is in talks to buy Aligned Data Centers in a transaction valued at roughly $40 billion, according to Bloomberg . Earlier this week, the Financial Times said GIP is eyeing a nearly $38 billion takeover of power provider AES . 3. No September jobs report this morning, as the federal government shutdown reaches day three. And yet, Wall Street is on track for a solid week, with the S & P 500 up 1% so far. It's headed for a higher open this morning, too. 4. Johnson & Johnson was upgraded to buy from hold at Wells Fargo, as the existential risks around tariffs and drug pricing policy changes are now off the table. Analysts are also upbeat on J & J's cancer franchise. This has become a beloved stock. 5. Constellation Brands ' price target at UBS was cut to $175 from $205, but analysts kept their buy rating on the Modelo brewer. The beaten-up stock trades at over 11 times forward earnings and supports a 2.9% dividend yield. But I don't trust it. 6. UBS is sticking with its sell rating on Tesla stock, even after third-quarter deliveries were better than expected. That's wrong. The analysts think the EV tax credit expiration pulled forward demand, and they are worried that investors may continue to sell the news. Tesla shares, which dropped 5% yesterday, were up nearly 1.5% this morning. 7. Defense drone maker AeroVironment got price target bumps to $400 and $415, respectively, at Citizens JMP and BTIG. Both firms have buy ratings on the stock and are very bullish. I have been championing this one since $75 per share. Now, everyone loves AeroVironment. 8. KeyBanc downgraded Corteva to hold from buy after the provider of seed and crop protection announced plans to split into two companies. Is this the twilight of the breakups? Club stocks Honeywell and DuPont stalled after breakup announcements. Spin purgatory . It makes them big underperformers. 9. After CSX's surprise CEO ouster , Citi analysts suggest a three-way merger between CSX, Canadian Pacific Kansas City , and Berkshire Hathaway -owned BNSF. They say it would be a "savvy counter-measure" to the planned Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern merger, which would create the first coast-to-coast freight rail operator. 10. Barclays lowered its price target on PepsiCo to $140 from $144. The analysts, who kept their hold rating, said they are more cautious heading into earnings – slightly more cautious than the consensus on sales and margins. Pepsi reports third-quarter results next week.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[新华社北京10月3日电 美国媒体2日披露，波音公司将再次推迟交付波音777X型客机，可能因此损失数十亿美元。
美国彭博社援引消息人士的话报道，首架波音777X型客机最新的预计交付时间从2026年推迟到2027年年初。波音777X的首批客户德国汉莎航空公司和阿联酋航空公司已更改了该机型入役时间表。

波音777X项目启动于2013年。该机型即使2026年实现交付，也比最初的预计迟了6年。

            
波音首席执行官凯利·奥特伯格9月曾说，由于“大量工作”仍有待完成，波音777X的认证已落后于计划。他表示这一项目并没有出现新的技术问题，当时也没有暗示交付时间会延迟。
彭博社援引行业人士所作估算报道，波音可能因最新的推迟交付而损失10亿至40亿美元。
另据法新社2日援引波音内部备忘录报道，8月初开始的波音军用机部门雇员罢工可能还将持续相当长一段时间。
波音位于美国密苏里州圣路易斯地区和伊利诺伊州的大约3200名军机组装工人8月4日开始罢工。波音内部备忘录写道，鉴于圣路易斯地区工厂工会领导层在过去数周的行动，罢工可能还将持续数周甚至数月。因此，波音已决定启动第二阶段危机应对方案，包括雇用更多替代工人和确定更多可外包完成的工作。
去年，因超过3万名民品部门雇员罢工，波音位于美国西北部太平洋沿岸地区的工厂停工超过7周。（惠晓霜）]]></content>

乌克兰能源部表示，俄军袭击的重点是天然气输送设施。乌救援人员和技术专家正在抢修相关设施。
乌克兰波尔塔瓦州军事管理局局长弗拉基米尔·科古特在社交媒体发文称，当天凌晨，波尔塔瓦州遭到导弹和无人机袭击，当地能源基础设施受损。

            
波尔塔瓦州是乌石油和天然气重要生产基地。据乌媒报道，今年2月以来，俄军对波尔塔瓦州的炼油厂和天然气生产设施发动轮番袭击，导致乌天然气产能锐减40%以上，对乌今年冬季越冬天然气储备造成严重影响。
乌空军在社交媒体发文说，2日晚至3日凌晨，俄军从库尔斯克州、布良斯克州、罗斯托夫州、奥廖尔州、斯摩棱斯克州、克拉斯诺达尔边疆区向乌境内发射381架无人机和35枚导弹。俄军袭击重点是关键基础设施，尤其是哈尔科夫州和波尔塔瓦州的能源基础设施，此外，苏梅州、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克州、敖德萨州、基辅州也遭到俄军袭击。截至3日上午10时，乌防空火力和电子战部队拦截了303架无人机和17枚导弹。]]></content>

長榮航空睽違9年再度開拓北美新航點，宣布自今（3）日起正式啟航桃園－達拉斯直飛航線，首航儀式於桃園機場舉行，外交部長林佳龍出席活動時表示，新航線不僅提升台美交通便利性，更具深遠的外交與經貿戰略意義，將成為深化科技產業合作、促進企業全球布局的重要助力。


林佳龍指出，外交部與長榮航空長期保持緊密合作，長榮在北美九個航點皆設有我國駐外辦事處，是政府推動國民外交與經貿布局的重要夥伴。他肯定長榮航空在服務國人與外籍投資者上的貢獻，並形容長榮是政府「最好的夥伴」。

他提到，外界高度關注台美關稅談判的進展，雙方亦有意合作設立科學園區，其中德州將扮演關鍵角色。近年多家電子大廠已加碼投資美國，訂單不斷湧入、擴廠腳步加快，除了亞利桑那州外，德州同樣是布局重點。林佳龍以親身經驗笑稱「德州真的很大，不只是牛排大，面積真的很大。」他強調，直飛航線可大幅縮短企業與專業人才的交通時間，加速合作進程。


面對外界對產業外移的疑慮，林佳龍明確表示，台灣企業赴美投資並非產業外移，而是策略性運用美國在科技、人才與資金方面的優勢。他以亞利桑那州的半導體聚落為例，說明航空網絡對產業群聚與生態系發展的推動力，並強調「電子七哥們走向海外，不是離開台灣，而是共同打造台美的聯合艦隊。」


林佳龍進一步指出，德州已成為台灣對美投資的重點區域，達拉斯、休士頓與奧斯汀構成的「德州三角」更是科技產業與製造業的熱區。新航線啟用後，不僅有助於雙邊人員與貨物流通，也對台美經貿談判及科技合作產生加乘效果。政府將持續整合外交與產業資源，協助台灣企業拓展國際市場，深化與美國的全面合作夥伴關係。


長榮航空董事長林寶水表示，公司早在1998年即開辦達拉斯貨運航線，今年進一步啟動客運航線，主要是因應企業進駐增加及當地經濟、人口快速成長，使達拉斯成為德州重要的經濟與商業中心之一。此次新開航線，讓長榮成為亞洲唯一同時營運德州兩大航點的航空公司，並可藉由全球第三大客運量的達拉斯機場轉運優勢，銜接美國國內與中南美洲城市，提供旅客更高便利性。


新航線初期每週飛航3班，11月18日起增為每週5班，12月15日起更將改為每日飛航。桃園－達拉斯航線由波音787-9執飛，首航班旅客搭乘率超過9成，幾近滿座。首航活動現場除展示全新機上服務用品與商品，也設有拍照打卡區並安排牛仔舞表演，讓旅客登機前就能感受濃厚德州風情。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[IT之家 10 月 3 日消息，据央视财经昨日报道，2025 国庆中秋假期，自驾游出行火热。眼下一种新的出行方式正在流行：人坐飞机或火车，汽车提前托运走，游客到目的地后，开启“落地自驾”新模式。
报道称，将汽车托运到目的地再进行自驾游，不仅方便，还能节省不少开支。不少车主发现，相比全程自驾或在当地租车，汽车托运反而更加经济实惠。

报道还提到，热门托运线路主要从北上广深等一线城市出发，目的地则集中在成都、青岛、西安、乌鲁木齐、昆明、三亚等热门旅游城市。
从费用上看：

热门线路如北京至上海 1200 公里，里程单价为每公里 1.2 元至 1.5 元，总费用约 1440 元至 1800 元；

冷门线路如西安至酒泉 1500 公里，里程单价为每公里 1.6 元至 1.8 元，总费用约 2400 元至 2700 元。


IT之家注意到，除了常规的汽车托运汽车，国铁 12306 已在今年 6 月上线火车托运汽车业务，也就是通过货运列车（使用 JSQ6 型凹底双层运输汽车专用车）将民众的汽车托运至指定地点。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The death penalty remains a divisive issue in Taiwan, with activists calling for it to be abolished. Although a court ruling limits the use of capital punishment, a recent execution has drawn debate.
    Opponents of capital punishment say that the death penalty violates the right to life Image: Sergey Nepsha/Zoonar/picture alliance    
In January 2025, the execution of Huang Lin-kai reignited Taiwan's death penalty debate, with activists saying authorities acted in disregard of the law. 
The execution, the island's first in five years, came just months after Taiwan's Constitutional Court issued a landmark ruling narrowing the scope of capital punishment and requiring stricter safeguards for its application.
 At the time, some observers thought the ruling meant Taiwan was edging toward "de facto abolition" of the death penalty.
Supporters argue capital punishment delivers retributive justice, deters crime and is backed by public opinion. Opponents counter that the death penalty violates the right to life, risks wrongful execution and lacks proven deterrent effects.
How is the death penalty applied in Taiwan?
The 2024 ruling stipulates that the death penalty is to be applied only in the "most serious cases of intentional homicide." It also opens avenues for appeal and rules that executions must be agreed upon unanimously by trial courts and courts of appeal.
Huang Lin-kai was convicted of a double murder in 2013.
According to the Death Penalty Project, a UK-based NGO providing legal assistance to people on death row, the execution took place while an appeal was pending.
The NGO said Huang was executed "summarily and unlawfully. He and his legal team were given less than four hours' notice of his execution."
This amounted to an "indefensible disregard for the right to life and the due process of law enshrined in the Taiwanese Constitution," the NGO wrote in a press release.
According to the Death Penalty Project, executions in Taiwan are carried out by shooting, with prisoners sedated, laid face-down and shot through the heart.


A political statement for the death penalty?
Justice Minister Cheng Ming-chien defended the decision, saying Huang's case was the only one among the dozens of inmates currently on death row to be fully reviewed by the prosecutor general, in line with the Constitutional Court ruling.
His crimes were considered the most serious, defense counsel was present, verdicts were unanimous, and all legal remedies had been exhausted.
Taiwanese Premier Cho Jung-tai said the process "was carried out within constitutional bounds."
Catherine Appleton, a criminal justice researcher specializing in capital punishment, told DW that she believes Huang's execution had political motivations.
"You've had five years of no executions before. That to me is a political statement saying we want the public to know: We are in favor of the death penalty," she said.
The execution was the first under Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te, who took office in 2024.
Saul Lehrfreund, co-executive director of the Death Penalty Project, told DW that the execution seemed "so random and so political."
"Why him?" he said. "And what's the rational thinking behind that execution?"
Surveys consistently find that about 80% of Taiwanese people oppose abolishing the death penalty.
Lehrfreund said the issue was far more nuanced. 
Based on his own surveys in Taiwan, he said, if the question were "Do you support the death penalty?" most people would answer "yes." But only about 30% would say they "strongly support" it, he said.
Taiwan is often praised for democratic progress — from legalizing same-sex marriage to its free speech laws. But experts warn that its retention of the death penalty undermines these advancements.
"All the other positives are such a big contrast with China," said Lehrfreund. "But on the death penalty, Taiwan looks the same."
In a statement, the European Union condemned the execution and called on Taiwan to "pursue a consistent policy towards the full abolition of the death penalty."
"If Taiwan is at a crossroads, it must decide what kind of democracy it wants to be. A true democracy cannot keep the death penalty," Appleton said.


A complicated outcome for families of victims
Victims groups in Taiwan remain among the strongest supporters of keeping the death penalty. A 2024 survey by the Association for Victims Support found that over 96% of homicide victims' families opposed abolition.
Lehrfreund acknowledged their pain but insisted that executions are not the answer.
"The death penalty doesn't heal. The death penalty re-traumatizes these people," he said. He cited a new study from the United States of what he called "co-victims."
Though many respondents said they supported executions immediately after crimes were committed, the study found, years later "none of them" said they continued to. 
"They felt that the death penalty just harmed them even more," Lehrfreund said.
In Taiwan, 36 prisoners are on death row. The average span between sentence and execution is 13 years, and some have waited over 20. "The death penalty doesn't allow for any closure and an ability to heal," Lehrfreund said. 


What are the alternatives to execution?
Appleton supports sentences for life in prison with the possibility of parole for the most serious offenses.
Appleton warned that life without parole is simply "another death sentence."
"People will die in prison. It creates hopelessness. That's why many inmates in the US say they'd rather be executed," she said.
She pointed to Taiwan's 2015 Kaohsiung prison crisis, when six long-term inmates took hostages before killing themselves. "Hopeless sentences create dangerous conditions," she said.
Instead, she argues for life imprisonment with parole — not a guarantee of release, but periodic reviews that uphold human dignity.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[IT之家 10 月 3 日消息，据《今日印度》昨天报道，苹果 Apple Watch Ultra 的上浮警报功能成功拯救了一名潜水员，使这名潜水员从致命危险中逃生。

Kshitij Zodape 几个月前到孟加拉湾潜水，当天水流很急，且能见度只有 5-10 米，他下水后发生意外，下潜至 36 米深时身上的配重带突然松脱，使他无法继续下潜，被快速推升至水面。
由于事件发生得过于突然，他一开始完全没有意识到发生了什么，但他手上戴着的 Apple Watch Ultra 手表迅速检测到了异常，弹出“上浮速度过快，必须放慢速度，否则可能受到伤害”通知，但当时他完全无法控制场面，还是被快速推升。

就在这时，手表在检测到持续异常后启动了紧急警报，自动发出警告声音，这时他身旁的教练才注意到异常，迅速解救了 Kshitij。
事后他专门写信感谢苹果，并将这段经历分享给苹果 CEO 蒂姆・库克，而这位 CEO 也亲自回信，IT之家附内容如下：

我对你的教练听到警报并及时救下你感到高兴，非常感谢你与我们分享这个故事，保重。

后来 Kshitij 回忆道，如果当时他没有戴 Apple Watch，那他可能完全没法被教练注意到，这种快速上浮可能会导致他的肺部像气球一样急剧膨胀并发生破裂，足以致命。]]></content>

The biotech company BIOCAD produced 305,000 packs of medicines for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases in the first six months of this year, Moscow Deputy Mayor for Transport and Industry Maxim Liksutov reported.


BIOCAD is part of the pharmaceutical cluster and a resident of the Technopolis Moscow special economic zone. The company has been producing medicines for cancer and autoimmune diseases for four years.

“As part of Mayor Sergey Sobyanin’s directives to ensure medicine security, the city signs offset contracts with pharmaceutical companies, guaranteeing sales in exchange for investments in production creation and modernization. This allows companies to invest in technology development, R&D, and scientific research while supplying products under city contracts and to the market. Under such a contract, BIOCAD built the PK-137 production complex, which has produced five million packs of medicines for socially significant diseases since 2021,” Liksutov said, as reported by the Moscow Department of Investment and Industrial Policy.

Two million packs were supplied to Moscow hospitals, while another three million were distributed across Russia's regions.

The pharmaceutical production facility is located in Technopolis Moscow at Alabushevo. Under the offset agreement, the company set up production of 18 international nonproprietary medicines for cancer and autoimmune diseases, included in Russia’s list of essential and vital medicines.

Anatoly Garbuzov, head of the Moscow Department of Investment and Industrial Policy, noted that the investor had built and launched a 43,000-square-meter production facility and created over 300 new jobs.


“The company invested 8.2 billion rubles in the project,” Garbuzov emphasized.






Over eight years, the Moscow government signed 35 offset contracts for supplying medicines, medical devices, dairy products, infrastructure elements, traction batteries for electric transport, compact electric utility machinery, elevator equipment, and more. The total procurement volume under these contracts will exceed 700 billion rubles, creating over 9,000 new jobs and generating investments of more than 126 billion rubles in production development.

Under nine offset contracts, investors have completed construction and modernization of production facilities, with deliveries already underway for city needs.]]></content>

        <updated>2025-10-03T12:06:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[In his hugely influential 1992 bestseller, The End of History and the Last Man, the political scientist Francis Fukuyama famously asserted that “history” as the German philosophers Hegel and Marx understood it—that is, the evolution of human societies—had come to its conclusion. Liberal democracy and free-market capitalism, although they might never be adopted in every country, represented the end point of millennia of ideological development and transformation. Fukuyama called the United States a “post-historical” country, positing that it had long ago finished its political evolution and was merely waiting for China and other countries to draw back from the historical dead-end of authoritarianism.
The subsequent spread of this philosophy among the United States’ intellectual, political, and business elite was remarkable. In particular, a conviction that the Internet and free trade would attract benighted countries toward liberal democratic capitalism became commonplace. “By joining the [World Trade Organization],” U.S. President Bill Clinton asserted in March 2000, “China is not simply agreeing to import more of our products. It is agreeing to import one of democracy’s most cherished values: economic freedom. The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people.”
Instead, since China joined the WTO in 2001, it has seen its economy grow 1,400 percent under a one-party state-capitalist system. It has, since 2010, become the world’s largest exporter while systematically violating the WTO’s foundational principles. The Chinese government steals intellectual property through cyber-operations and human-intelligence recruitment. It forces foreign companies operating in China to share their technologies with local firms. It also spends ten times what the United States does to subsidize domestic firms. Since 2012, when Xi Jinping became the country’s paramount leader, China’s domestic politics have grown significantly less liberal, and state authorities have exploited greater connectivity and advanced technology in an ever-expanding effort to surveil and police its citizens.
If the evolution of China’s political and economic systems was merely disproof of Fukuyama’s thinking, that would be striking enough. But China’s movement away from liberalism and laissez-faire economics is only half the story. The other, more striking half is that the United States has become much more like China. As the U.S. and Chinese economies have deepened their integration, a phenomenon the historian Niall Ferguson has dubbed “Chimerica,” American politics have also moved in a distinctly illiberal direction. And China’s rise has played a major part. Compelling studies have linked the so-called China shock, in which an exodus of manufacturing jobs devastated many U.S. communities, to an abrupt rise in U.S voter polarization and demands for robust political action. In the 2016 presidential election, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump singled out China’s rise as a principal cause of U.S. economic malaise.
Fukuyama did not foresee such a development. But the U.S. turn toward illiberalism would hardly have surprised another twentieth-century thinker: the jurist and political historian Carl Schmitt. Schmitt came to prominence in the failing German Weimar Republic of the 1920s and then to notoriety after supporting and assisting the rising Nazi dictatorship. It is his version of history that is currently playing out in the United States. And it is by his principles that the Trump administration is turning the country in an ever more authoritarian direction.
THE EXCEPTION BECOMES THE RULE
Since Trump’s first term, the White House has increasingly relied on untested or dubious assertions of presidential authority—such as executive orders based on “emergency” or “national security” threat designations—in order to shield U.S. industries and jobs from rapidly growing Chinese competition and to protect the United States against Chinese government efforts to steal its data and intellectual property, infiltrate its critical networks, make it dependent on Chinese entities, and undermine its defense capabilities. Under Trump’s second administration, such practices have expanded well beyond what had previously been justified by the economic and security threats posed by China. Such authority is now used indiscriminately to impose sweeping global tariffs, sanctions, export bans, and investment restrictions; issue corporatist edicts, blacklists, and polygraphic loyalty tests for law enforcement officers; militarize policing; institute mass firings, mass pardons, and mass deportations; weaponize the legal system against political and media “enemies”; impound or redirect funds; create new government entities and abolish or downsize existing ones; and exert government direction over private institutions such as universities and law firms.


As a result, the United States has moved decidedly away from liberal democracy and toward what Schmitt called a “plebiscitary” democracy—that is, one in which an elected (or merely ratified) president rules, but legal checks on the president’s power are dispensed with. Trump, of course, tried to cling to power after losing the 2020 election, stoking a seditious riot at the Capitol. He has also threatened to skirt a constitutional ban on a third presidential term. Fukuyama’s thesis is silent on this phenomenon. Illiberalism, by his reasoning, was destined only to contract, not to spread to liberal democracies—in particular, not to the world’s oldest.
It is noteworthy that the economic symbiosis between today’s two great powers, the United States and China, was completely missing from the Cold War competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. Moscow did not interact with the vast panoply of U.S. trade and investment rules. U.S.-inspired norms enforced at the international level by the WTO, the International Monetary Fund, and other international institutions therefore went unchallenged by Washington’s ideological rival. The effect was to reinforce a liberal democratic political regime in the United States and foster the illusion that the United States could only spread liberal democracy—and never itself depart from it.
Had Schmitt lived a bit longer (he died in 1985, at the age of 96), he would have seen the possibility of a different trajectory. Born to a devout, lower-middle-class Catholic family in predominantly Protestant Plettenberg, Westphalia, in 1888, Schmitt rose to prominence as a scholar of constitutional law and European political history. His thinking was shaped by angst over Germany’s political and economic struggles during the 1920s—struggles he blamed on a liberal constitution that promoted paralyzing proceduralism over the forging of national unity and decisive leadership. Although Schmitt never argued that liberalism would inevitably be supplanted by illiberalism, he did argue that liberalism was inherently fragile and would necessarily be broken by crises—that is, by events that could not be contemplated by a constitution or set of laws. In those events, a decision-maker would need to act beyond legal boundaries in order to defend the liberal system supposedly circumscribed by those boundaries.

 The U.S. turn toward illiberalism would hardly have surprised Schmitt.
History for Schmitt did not reveal the unfolding of progress, as it did for Hegel or Fukuyama, but rather the persistence of struggle—specifically, a struggle between political identities. Schmitt saw the liberal notion that politics could be reduced to rules-based debate and voting within and between countries as a dangerous fiction. The “friend-enemy” dichotomy was eternal among organized human societies. Indeed, any group set on disowning it would only prove its existence by provoking other entities to resist the group’s self-serving assertions of supposed universal values. Schmitt thus considered liberal pacifists the most dangerous of political ideologues, as they necessarily cast their opponents as “enemies of humanity”—thereby justifying their utter destruction.
The United States has long had enemies not because it sought them out but because it has sometimes stood for allegedly universal values (such as liberty, freedom, democracy, and human rights) that clashed with more particularist ones held by others (such as the preservation of national autonomy, dignity, or culture). As American values brooked no exceptions, they were arguably more likely to breed total war—as in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq—than were particularist national values.


In seeing itself as “post-historical,” Schmitt would have argued, the United States became vulnerable to exploitation by countries following “historical” political theologies. China, first and foremost, was able to exploit weak, rules-based liberal mechanisms—such as those enshrined in the WTO and U.S. trade and investment laws—to dominate global economic sectors, impinging directly on U.S. national and economic security. The result was a growing sense of threat in the United States, which in turn created public demand for—or at least toleration of—a decision-maker who would declare a state of “crisis” and act outside normal legislative or judicial restraints. Such restraints, Schmitt argued, gave the illusion of liberal democratic governance in between periods of crisis. If crises became frequent or persistent, this illusion became apparent, leading to a rapid slide toward authoritarianism.
Schmitt would have considered the WTO a disingenuous liberal effort to hide politics behind the cloak of economics. In his view, trade conflicts were nothing less than political conflicts; trade wars merely unmasked power imbalances that could never be resolved by multilateral rules, dispute-settlement mechanisms, appellate bodies, and the like. After China’s rapid rise as a major economic power following the country’s WTO accession, the U.S. backlash that began in Trump’s first term—his refusal to approve appellate judges to the WTO, his imposition of import barriers through nonjusticiable national security notifications, and his levying of sweeping global tariffs in violation of “most favored nation” commitments—was, by Schmittian reasoning, inevitable.
As China’s economic and military might continued to grow, Schmitt would have expected the United States to either neuter or leave collectives such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, NATO, and even the United Nations. He saw all these institutions, erected by Washington in the immediate aftermath of World War II, as manifestations of its determination to impose hidden forms of hegemonic control in the guise of a commitment to internationalism. As Washington’s relative dominance continues to decline, however, that control will wane. The United States will, in response, fall back on claims that its beneficence has been abused, that the institutions on which it bestowed this beneficence have become obsolete, and that it must therefore disengage from them.
RED SCARE
One does not have to buy into Schmitt’s cynicism toward liberal motives to see the logic of his belief in liberal declinism. It is necessary only to accept his premise that politics is eternal and inherently adversarial and that liberalism is vulnerable to crisis because of its reliance on the fiction that the law—rather than the decision-maker who oversteps it—is sovereign.
To quote from Schmitt’s earliest work of note, Political Theology, from 1922, “The sovereign is he who decides the exception”—that is, the instance when a legal order must be suspended in the name of preserving it. In periods of intense conflict with other polities, democratic liberalism has either to give way to more unifying forces—that is, to communism, fascism, or other forms of dictatorship—or to confront the possibilities of anarchy and defeat.
China’s rise to the status of near-peer competitor to the United States, together with its capacity to realize its ambitions to reshape international relations, institutions, and norms, led Washington to see the country as a looming existential threat. Over the past decade, the relationship between the two countries has transformed into a civilizational showdown. In 2005, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick called on China to become a “responsible stakeholder” in a liberal international order. Instead, the country grew into what the Trump administration in 2017 branded a “revisionist power”—or in Schmitt’s terminology, an “absolute enemy” of the existing order. The China threat prodded the United States to undergo a radical and self-contradictory transformation in which it became, in supposed defense of its liberal identity, progressively less liberal and more absolutist. It was Fukuyama in reverse.

 China’s illiberal rise is the force pulling the United States away from liberalism.
Conforming to Schmitt’s dictum that the sovereign decides “the exception,” Trump in his second term has, on a near-daily basis, declared implausible emergencies and threats to national security to justify acts that violate legal norms. Under Trump, even phenomena as banal as current account deficits, which have existed for decades and show no negative correlation with economic performance, have been branded emergencies that require the president to assume unlimited tariffing powers—powers that the U.S. Constitution assigns exclusively to Congress.
Defending Trump’s unprecedented presidential actions as consistent with the once fringe legal theory of “the unitary executive,” the president’s advisers conjure Schmittian notions of the sovereign decision-maker unconstrained by liberal myths of governance according to rules, debate, and divided authority. That Congress fails to guard its prerogatives jealously, as the founders had intended, is an unmistakable sign that the constitutional order is crumbling.


Clearly, China is not the reason for all these sweeping new assertions of presidential power. But it was the chisel used to weaken the foundation of constitutional checks and balances in the name of protecting the imperiled American worker. Just as Fukuyama saw liberal democracy as a gravitational field that pulled illiberal regimes toward it, Schmitt would have seen China’s illiberal rise as the force pulling the United States away from liberalism—ironically, in defense of a liberal international order.
It is notable that China’s intellectual class has, since 2003, experienced what Chinese and Western intellectuals have called “Schmitt fever”: surging interest in a Western thinker who had allegedly debunked the notion that American liberal democracy was inherently superior to other forms of political organization. From 1979 until 2003, references to Schmitt in scholarly articles on China’s national published works database were paltry. Since then, however, they have soared virtually every year and are now more than 30 times as high as they were in 2003. Schmitt has, in effect, become the Chinese Fukuyama.
THE ROAD TO ILLIBERALISM
Is the road to American illiberalism one way? No. Schmitt’s theories about liberalism, unlike Fukuyama’s, were never teleological—they did not claim inevitabilities, only tendencies.
In this regard, it is worth recalling the full title of Fukuyama’s bestseller: The End of History and the Last Man. The “last man” refers to the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche’s portrait of the type of person likely to emerge from the consummation of a true liberal consumerist society. He was, Nietzsche and Fukuyama feared, a passionless, convictionless being who valued security and comfort over nobility and heroism. He might even come to undermine liberalism by shrinking from the need to defend it.
Similarly, the last man on Schmitt’s path to a führer-forged society may be one who tires of “winning” and “greatness”—particularly if neither actually materializes—and grows nostalgic for the relative tranquility of reliable rules, procedures, and routines. With his refusal to engage with existential politics in which every political or economic challenge is an emergency requiring presidential action, he emboldens dormant institutions, such as Congress, to reassert historical prerogatives. The problem of the Schmittian enemy and its capabilities and intentions remains, of course, but the scope of asserted presidential powers shrinks to a level commensurate with the actual threat.
History, however, suggests that reversions in the direction of liberal democracy—as in the case of West Germany after Word War II—are never smooth or mechanical. They are more likely to be jagged, bloody, and costly. The founder James Madison famously warned about the dangers rising factionalism and failing checks and balances—two developments demonstrably in evidence today—pose to the American republic.
What could revive the fortunes of democratic liberalism is a reformulation of the ideological, security, and economic glue that bound the United States to European and Asian allies during the Cold War. That glue strengthened the role of political friends in the Schmittian calculus, which in turn limited invocations of the kinds of exceptions to constitutional order that weaken the glue and undermine the safety and prosperity of all.
The possibility of such a reformulation, however, seems remote at present, particularly given that the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom—long-standing Schmittian friends of the United States—have all witnessed the rise of right-wing populist parties that question the continued benefits of postwar liberal democracy. Indeed, then, the West’s flirtation with Schmittian illiberalism seems to have only just begun.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[IT之家 10 月 3 日消息，节假日用微信工作算“免费加班”吗？据极目新闻、央视新闻本周报道，离职工程师王先生（化姓）将前公司告上了法院，追讨自己两年来节假日和休息日期间的加班费。
据湖北武汉东湖高新技术法院消息，经审理，法院认为：在休息时间通过社交媒体付出实质性劳动，同样构成加班，用人单位必须依法支付报酬。经核算，判决公司支付王先生加班费 5000 元。
2020 年 5 月，王先生入职某建设公司担任主办工程师。2022 年 10 月，他被公司口头要求提交离职申请。离职后，王先生将前公司告上法庭，要求支付长达两年多的加班工资。
王先生表示，在职时他存在大量延时加班、节假日加班和休息日加班，包括元旦、清明、劳动节、端午、中秋、国庆及春节等，这些加班大多通过微信进行 —— 需要在工作群中回复消息、汇报工作进度、发送现场照片等。
庭审中，前公司辩称王先生是主动离职，并否认存在加班事实，认为其诉请的加班时间和金额没有事实依据。经审理，法院认为：

王先生提供的微信聊天记录中的开会记录和照片等证据，能够证明其在休息时间付出了实质性劳动。公司明显占用了劳动者休息时间，应当认定为加班；

由于王先生没有提供具体的打卡记录，微信记录的加班时长难以精确量化，全部认定为加班有失公平。最终，法院综合考量其工资情况、职务要求、加班频率、时长和内容后，酌定该建筑公司向王先生支付加班费 5000 元。

法官表示，随着工作方式多元化，通过微信等线上工具在休息时间处理工作的情况非常普遍。判断加班的核心在于是否在标准工作时间外付出了实质性劳动。如果劳动者在国庆节等法定节假日通过线上方式处理了明确、具体的工作任务，而非仅仅是偶尔回复简单信息，就可能被认定为加班。
法官详细解释了法定节假日加班的工资计算标准（IT之家注：以 2025 年为例）：

国庆 10 月 1 日至 3 日及中秋节（10 月 6 日）属于法定休假日，安排加班应支付 3 倍工资，且不能以补休替代；

10 月 4 日、5 日、7 日、8 日为休息日调休，安排加班且不能补休的，需支付 2 倍工资。]]></content>

颱風靠近，為本港帶來酷熱天氣，周五下午多處地區氣溫上升至33度或以上。在中環碼頭，想吃雪糕消消暑，都要先在烈日當空下排隊。想沒有那麼熱，出動電風扇。

在美国社交论坛“红迪”（reddit）上，“今日新知”话题区有一条热帖，迄今有3109次点赞，658条评论。
“我今天才知道，中国在二战中对打败日本，发挥了重要作用。中国伤亡超过800万。”帖文写道。
评论区众说纷纭，大量回复叠起了高楼。在一个不起眼的角落里，有人予以纠正，“死亡人数远超于此……大多数西方人对日本当时造成的破坏一无所知。”
“如果问当前美国学龄儿童，甚至包括他们的父母，他们都会自信地回答，二战开始于1941年12月7日。因为日军袭击了正在夏威夷珍珠港休整的美国海军舰队。”美国退役陆军军官、国际军事史委员会主席哈罗德·拉夫告诉南方周末记者，“很多美国人对中国本土战场，以及中国在印缅战场和太平洋战场作出的贡献知之甚少。”
2025年8月，美国国务院发言人在广岛核爆80周年纪念日时说，“美国与日本结束了太平洋地区一场毁灭性的战争。”引发国际社会抗议。中国国防部新闻发言人在答记者问时，讽刺美方对日本法西斯罪行“得了健忘症”，谴责美国粉饰美化日本侵略战争罪行，“这是对历史正义的严重亵渎，更是对受害国人民感情的严重伤害”。
作为世界反法西斯战争东方主战场，中国战区牵制日军50%以上的海外兵力，中国人民付出了伤亡3500万人的沉重代价。哈罗德·拉夫认为，二战期间太平洋战区分为两条战线。如果没有中国军队英勇地与日军交战，日本会派出更多军力进入太平洋岛屿。“中国在世界反法西斯战争胜利中，发挥了重要的作用。但当今世界军事史里，这一作用被严重低估。”

双重标准
2025年3月29日，美国国防部长皮特·赫格塞思出席了一场由日美联合举办的纪念活动，以纪念硫磺岛战役80周年。赫格塞思在发言中称赞时任日军司令栗林忠道，“以坚忍、决心和勇气领导着他的士兵和水手。”引发轩然大波。
硫磺岛战役是二战中最血腥、最具象征意义的战役之一。长达36天的夺岛战役中，美军付出了超2.5万人伤亡的惨重代价才攻占全岛，伤亡人数首次超过日军。正是此次战役的重大伤亡，促使美国下决心对日本使用原子弹。
一场如此悲壮的攻坚战里，日本法西斯处心积虑负隅顽抗，却被美国国防部长誉为“英勇无畏”。韩国延世大学汉学研究所研究员金凯撰文质疑，美国官员极少赞扬纳粹德国的军事努力，为什么同样作为二战法西斯轴心国之一的日本，却成了例外？
他认为，赫格塞思的发言，凸显了日本作为美国东亚地缘政治核心盟友的战略重要性，而美日之间的战争历史则基本被

As with much of the real estate industry, property technology, generally defined as the use of tech and software to make real estate and property management more efficient, took a big hit in recent years. 

Higher interest rates, a capital market retraction and a push by almost all venture capital into artificial intelligence collectively hit property tech hard. While there is, of course, some AI in property tech, it hasn't been enough to really drive interest in a sector that has historically been extremely slow to modernize. 
"I'd say we just lived through probably the most challenging three years that certainly I've ever experienced," said Brendan Wallace, co-founder and CEO of Fifth Wall. "You saw a lot of companies and new businesses and venture funds die. We just lived through an extinction event."
Fifth Wall is a venture capital fund managing over $3 billion in capital, the largest investment firm focused on technology for the built environment.

Wallace said the winter is over for property tech, citing last year's IPO of ServiceTitan, a cloud-based field service management software for trades such as HVAC, plumbing, electrical and landscaping. The company raised about $625 million in its initial public offering, and shares jumped 42% in their Nasdaq debut. 
Wallace also noted new unicorns, such as Juniper Square and Bilt, which bode well for the future of property tech investing. Bilt, a platform offering loyalty rewards for housing, raised $250 million in July at a $10.75 billion valuation in a funding round led by General Catalyst and GID, including a strategic investment from United Wholesale Mortgage.  

"The amount of enterprise value destruction that happened to prop tech was unprecedented from 2022 to 2024, but the amount of enterprise value creation that has just happened in the last 15 months has also been unprecedented," Wallace said.
That is not the case, however, in climate-related property tech. That space is becoming increasingly challenged due to the political winds in the U.S. that have shifted dramatically away from sustainability and climate resilience, not to mention climate science overall. As a result, the entire climate tech ecosystem in real estate is suffering. 
Again, real estate has always been slow to modernize and was particularly slow to decarbonize. It got a huge boost, however, from President Joe Biden's administration and billions of dollars in public funding, much of which went to decarbonizing real estate overall. Then, Wallace said, the world shifted under its feet.
"Many climate funds are struggling to raise. Many real estate owners are deprioritizing sustainability, decarbonization and ESG [environmental, social and governance], and there is a palpable, negative sentiment shift that has set on climate-related prop tech," Wallace explained. "And so what that means is we're still supporting our companies. We're actually still seeing lots of good progress, but the sentiment is negative."
Despite the shift, he said he is optimistic about the sector for one powerful reason: While national policy may be anti-climate, local governments are not. Cities are running out of money, and carbon taxes are a very attractive way of raising capital. New York City is a prime example. It is not only moving much further left in its politics, but it has consistently been more environmentally progressive. 
Fifth Wall, one of the biggest investors in this space, is taking the long-term play, investing while the negative "halo" around climate persists because valuations are attractive.
"My view is the real estate industry is still responsible for 40% of carbon emissions. It's still this industry that has shirked its responsibility for years, and it's going to cost a lot to decarbonize. It's a lot of money, and capital is going to flow into that space ... which is one of the reasons why we're still deploying capital, because we're the only ones," Wallace said.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[新华社罗马/上海10月2日电（记者李彦南 许晓青 徐欣涛）意大利中部马尔凯大区的小城马切拉塔安宁平静，这里山城景色迷人。沿着起伏蜿蜒的街道行走，仿佛能感受到时间短暂停滞。此地正是意大利著名传教士利玛窦的故乡。
入住酒店时，一张名为“利玛窦旅行路线”的城市地图吸引了记者注意。地图上有不少以利玛窦命名的街道、大楼和广场，其中最引人注目的是一个以中文拼音“利玛窦”命名的广场。广场虽小，却处于城市核心位置，在这里竖立着一组以利玛窦与中国明代科学家徐光启为原型的雕塑《利徐谈道》。

走近这组两米多高的青铜雕塑，可见利玛窦身着儒服，一只手指向远方似在讲述，身旁的徐光启则望向他所指的方向认真倾听。雕塑旁的讲解牌以意、中、英三语写道：17世纪的这两位圣贤开创了中欧文明互鉴的先河，为我们指明了携手同行的正确方向。
这组雕塑的创作者是上海视觉艺术学院教授杨冬白。他说：“意大利是雕塑大国，整个国家的街道、社区充满艺术气息，这次创作代表着中意两国间的文化交流，对我而言责任重大。”杨冬白说，他从内容设定、艺术风格等多角度考虑，最终创作出蕴含中国文化气质、风格粗犷洒脱的雕塑作品。“我畅想两位贤者漫步在马切拉塔街头，二人亦师亦友，边走边谈，画面既亲切又朴实自然。”
17世纪初，徐光启结识了来华传教士利玛窦，两人合作翻译了《几何原本》等多部西方科学著作，为中国科学技术发展作出贡献。利玛窦还将中国的四书五经传播到西方，他的《利玛窦中国札记》让西方世界逐步了解当时的中国。
今年5月，由利玛窦国际基金会捐赠的《利徐谈道》雕塑在马切拉塔市正式落成，为这座小城与中国的情缘续写新篇。马切拉塔市政府文化部门负责人卡蒂乌莎·卡塞塔说，数百年前利玛窦踏上东方之旅并融入中国文化，如今中意两国人民间的深厚情谊仍在延续，“在马切拉塔有许多与利玛窦相关的雕塑和纪念场所，人们能深入了解这座小城与中国的历史联系，铭记两国之间的深厚友谊”。

在徐光启的故乡上海，还有一组名为《徐利谈道》的雕塑竖立在徐汇区光启公园，与马切拉塔的《利徐谈道》遥相呼应。中意文化交流学者宋浩杰介绍，早在2014年，徐汇区就与马切拉塔市互赠雕像。“利玛窦把西方文化带入中国，徐光启则真诚地接纳西方的科学技术和文化，二人之间友好平等，互相尊重，互相欣赏，为当今两国人民交往作出表率。”
谈及利玛窦与中国的渊源，利玛窦国际基金会主席达里奥·格兰多尼（中文名：高达理）告诉记者，正是通过利玛窦，欧洲才真正认识了中国。作为一名传教士，他谦逊友好，尊重中国文化，深入了解中国，潜心研习中文，最终逐渐被博大精深的中华文明所折服。利玛窦与徐光启的珍贵情谊值得延续，如今意中两国人民应当增进交流，促进理解互信。

“以中文拼音命名这处‘利玛窦广场’，是希望中国友人来到此地也能感到宾至如归。昔日徐光启帮助利玛窦融入中国，而今我们希望让徐光启也能在这座城市留下足迹。”高达理说。（视频：吴念）]]></content>

On Friday, 24-year-old Tayra McDaniels will scamper down the stairs of her East Village apartment building and pick up four preordered vinyl editions of Taylor Swift's new album, "The Life of a Showgirl" — each a different color and with a different collectible cover. Then she'll head over to Target to snag three more exclusive CDs and another vinyl, she said.
The haul will cost her more than $200. "I know it's a lot of money," she said. "But I don't want to miss out."

One point of reprieve in the price: McDaniels and other vinyl fans won't have to worry about tariffs on their hauls.
Vinyl records, CDs and cassettes were spared from the Trump administration's late-August rollback of the "de minimis" exemption. The exemption, which had allowed packages valued at less than $800 to be imported without tariffs, was designed to simplify customs for low-cost imports and reduce fees for both consumers and small retailers. Trump's rollback of the exemption allowed tariffs to take effect on such shipments — but not on physical music.
A Cold War-era carveout known as the Berman Amendment to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act prevents presidents from regulating the flow of "informational materials," a category that includes physical music, books and artwork.
"If vinyl had gotten tariffed, you could have possibly seen the price of a record going up to $40 and $50," Berklee College of Music professor Ralph Jaccodine told CNBC. "So, this is welcome news for people buying physical music."
The exemption, which is protecting one of the fastest-growing segments of the music industry, is also welcome on Wall Street.

Vinyl sales have roared back in the past decade, particularly during the pandemic, driven by younger buyers and an appetite for nostalgia. The PVC discs now account for nearly three-quarters of all U.S. physical music revenue — a nearly 20% jump since 2020, according to data from the Recording Industry Association of America.
"It is very encouraging and a bit of a relief that physical music formats have been classified as exempt to tariffs," said Ryan Mitrovich, general manager of the Vinyl Alliance, a nonprofit promoting physical media that works with manufacturers, distributors and music labels. "However, we're not really taking anything for granted here with the chaotic climate around trade disruptions."



The sales boom has been lucrative for record labels such as Universal Music Group, or UMG, which works with Swift.
Her last album, "The Tortured Poets Department," sold 3.49 million physical and digital copies, according to entertainment data company Luminate, driving a 9.6% jump in UMG's second-quarter revenue in 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. Physical revenue, which includes vinyl, surged by 14.4% during the quarter.
Without a Swift album on shelves so far this year, UMG's most recent earnings report, in July, showed a 4.5% uptick in revenue year over year, but physical revenue decreased by 12.4%. UMG shares fell 24% after the July earnings release.
Universal Music Group declined to comment.
The downturn could be short-lived. Estimates from Billboard predict that first-week vinyl sales of Swift's new 12-track album, which debuts Friday, could top 1 million — breaking her own record of 859,000 for "The Tortured Poets Department."
"Taylor Swift has unique ability to drive the market through her decisions of what and how to release music," said Jaccodine, who has worked with artists such as Bruce Springsteen. "Swift's release can and will likely cause a boom in the music business."

Tariff trade-offs

Not everyone is celebrating the tariff exemptions. Some American record manufacturers say they're missing out on business.
"We support the tariffs because it helps U.S. manufacturing, and we want to be a part of the wave of making things in the USA," Alex Cushing, co-founder and president of Dallas-based Hand Drawn Records, told CNBC.
Most vinyl is pressed overseas, industry experts said, with the largest manufacturer, GZ Media, based in the Czech Republic. GZ CEO Michal Štěrba said the company has made top-selling albums for artists such as Lady Gaga, Madonna and U2. On average, the company produces 1 in 4 records from plants around the globe, including ones in Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee, he added.
"Our goal is to keep production as close to the customer as possible, so that a record sold in the U.S. is also made in the U.S.," Štěrba told CNBC.
If tariffs were imposed, Štěrba said, costs would get passed on to consumers.
"By keeping tariff costs out of the supply chain — regardless of the product or country — consumers benefit through better pricing," Štěrba said in a statement. "Ultimately, it's usually the customer who has to pay a higher price if tariffs are applied."
Cushing, a board member of the Vinyl Record Manufacturers Association, said he believes there would be more American jobs if tariffs were to apply to vinyl.
"We could put more hard-working Americans to work with good wages," he said. "Our company makes 2 million records annually with a staff of just 60. If you want to grow manufacturing jobs, this would be a great industry."
Cushing said U.S. manufacturers like his don't have the capacity to handle the demand for an album on Swift's scale. But for smaller-scale artists, he said, tariffs on imports could shift more business stateside.
"Our raw materials are tariffed, but with skyrocketing shipping and material costs globally, regional shipping in the U.S., coupled with having lower inventory, could help lower costs," Cushing said.
Some American manufacturers preempted extra costs earlier this year.
"Tariffs were definitely forecasted, and the industry was preparing for this for quite a while," Vinyl Alliance's Mitrovich said. "We saw a lot of companies defend against this by increasing their stocks of ink, PVC and other things in the months leading up to the tariffs."

Artists' earnings

For many artists, physical sales remain more lucrative than streaming.
On Spotify, earnings usually range between $0.003 and $0.005 per stream based on an artist's contract with their record label, Jaccodine said. Meanwhile, artists typically enjoy between 10% and 25% of royalties on physical records, according to the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.
"Unless you are just a handful of musicians, you basically are not making enough money from streaming to sustain," Jaccodine said. "For artists large and small, merchandise like records, CDs, cassettes, hats, hoodies and ticket sales are the bread and butter."
For comparison, Swift's Eras Tour, which was the highest-grossing tour of all time, sold over $2 billion worth of tickets for 149 shows over two years, The New York Times reported. Meanwhile, she earned between $200 million and $400 million from streaming platforms over that same period, according to figures from Billboard.

Gen Z's buying power

Analysts expect the vinyl market to keep expanding, though not at the explosive pace seen during the pandemic.
"The market for vinyl is strong and is likely to be for the foreseeable future, but there could always be supply troubles," Jaccodine said.
Gen Z has fueled vinyl's resurgence, industry experts said. Nearly 60% of 18- to 24-year-olds in a survey by music manufacturer Key Production said they listen to physical music, the highest of any demographic group. The survey was conducted Feb. 27-March 5, 2024, in the U.K., and had 503 respondents.
The vinyl comeback also kicked off an explosion in the number of "variants" released: collectible editions of albums or singles with alternative cover art, colored discs or vinyl-exclusive bonus tracks.
On TikTok, "vinyl hauls" rack up millions of views as fans show off rare variants and collections, sparking demand and motivating fans such as McDaniels to buy.
"It's sort of like Pokémon where you 'gotta catch 'em all,'" McDaniels said. "There's FOMO [fear of missing out] if someone has a variant that you don't."
Experts said Gen Z's interest in vinyl is also a response to digital burnout.
"So many groups are on their screens paying fees to have access to content but do not ever actually own anything, so this gives them physical ownership," Cushing said. "Vinyl is counter to all the ease of modern music listening and that's why people want it."
No artist has capitalized on the trend more than Swift.
"The Tortured Poets Department" was 2024's top album, accounting for over 6% of total album sales — more than seven times the next-best-selling artist, according to Luminate. Swift released 36 different album variants in the U.S. across digital and physical music.  
"The Life of a Showgirl" comes in at least seven different variants of colored vinyl, each with a unique cover. For Swift and UMG, every exclusive edition of a vinyl record, CD or cassette has the potential to generate millions in extra revenue.
"Sales of Swift's albums act as drivers for the fortunes of almost the entire music industry," Jaccodine said. "Her fans are waiting with bated breath for the release, but so is the industry."
For McDaniels and thousands of other superfans, the lingering question is how easy it will be to get the exclusive variants first.
"I know people think it's crazy," she said. "As long as a vinyl stays under $75 for a new release, I feel like it is worth it. It's like an addiction to getting these, but I love collecting them."]]></content>

The European Union (EU) wants to grab frozen Russian assets, but that would be theft and lead to legal proceedings, Russia has warned.


"Essentially, the proposal is to progressively confiscate assets — about $300 billion," Georgy Ostapkovich, academic supervisor at the Center for Market Studies at the Higher School of Economics, tells Sputnik.  

But that spells trouble for all involved, the pundit warns.  


"Belgium will suffer first of all, because these assets are held in Euroclear there," Ostapkovich warns. "In the future, investors are unlikely to place their assets in Euroclear, knowing they could be so easily liquidated without trial or due process, just as Russian assets are being liquidated."  







The seizure of another state’s central bank funds is an unjust and unprecedented step

 Lawsuits will follow, since Russia will not accept that 

The authority of Western countries and Western finance houses will be undermined 

The future of Belgian international trade payment service Euroclear would be uncertain  



"The likely consequence of such action by EU member states will be Russian confiscation of all assets of these countries, their companies and their citizens in the Russian Federation," international relations and Russian affairs analyst Gilbert Doctorow tells Sputnik. "That may create a political storm when the companies seek legal redress against their governments."






Euroclear has expressed concerns over its future and the future of the euro currency if the Russian sovereign assets are seized by the EU. Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has asked other EU leaders for guarantees they will share the risks.  

The European Central Bank has also voiced concerns over any asset seizure. At a virtual meeting of deputy finance ministers on September 30, it urged the European Commission to prove the move would not undermine the euro’s credibility.]]></content>

今年第1季房貸期數319期，再創歷史新高；信義房屋統計不動產資訊平台數據顯示，今年首季全國平均房貸期數達319期、平均房貸年限約26.58年，較前季平均貸款又多了兩個月，房貸期數再刷新紀錄。


信義房屋不動產企研室專案經理曾敬德分析，2022年首季全國平均房貸期數還在300期、約25年以下，但最新六都首季平均房貸期數皆超過26年，顯示30年房貸已逐漸取代20年房貸，成為市場主流。

以六都來看，今年首季平均房貸期數皆逾26年，其中高雄市期數最長、達328期、約27.33年，其次為新北市327期、約27.25年，桃園市325期、約27.08年，台南市324期、約27年，台中市321期、約26.75年，反倒是房價最高的台北市首季房貸年期平均僅312期、約26年，為今年首季六都房貸年期最少的都會區。


曾敬德建議，長年期房貸雖然降低眼前的每月房貸負擔，但民眾應該要留意寬限期過後開始償還本金時，每月負擔會突然大幅增加，另外，以前房貸利率高長輩會希望快點把房貸還完，現在房貸利率低民眾多希望可以多留些錢運用或投資，倘若35歲以後才用30年期房貸，真的有可能一路繳到退休，建議要做好自身財務規劃，檢視每月支出與退休後的生活資金來源等。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The German carmaker requires substantial amounts of minerals for its transition to electric vehicles. But new research by DW shows that some of Africa's most notorious smelters are part of Volkswagen's supply chain.

The 3TG, a group of raw materials that include tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold, makes a huge difference for the auto industry of our times as it strives to transition to electric vehicles (EV).
These materials are critically important for building suspension systems, wiring, lighting and electronic displays. Durable, resistant to corrosion and great for conducting electricity, 3TG minerals are currently high in demand from carmakers in Europe and elsewhere.
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) boasts some of the biggest deposits of such minerals in the world, and exploiting them could be a source of prosperity for the country in Central Africa.
However, current profits from mining 3TG help fuel a violent conflict in the country, so that they are often also called "conflict minerals."

DR Congo: What role do minerals play in the conflict?

According to new investigative research by DW and Dutch magazine De Groene Amsterdammer, 3TG conflict minerals are very likely to have ended up in the electric vehicles of Europe's biggest carmaker, Volkswagen (VW).
Based on VW's own Responsible Raw Materials Report, DW has found that at least six entities that have been linked by the DRC and the European Union to conflict minerals are part of the German company's supply chain. Another supplier, a gold refinery in Sudan, was until recently controlled by an armed group that the United States has accused of genocide.
In an emailed statement, a VW spokesperson wouldn't "confirm or rule out with absolute certainty" that the smelters are supplying the carmaker. 
Their appearance in VW's raw materials reporting system "does not indicate that they are necessarily part of our supply chain," the statement added.
The smelters identified by DW include tin smelters Malaysia Smelting Corporation, Thailand's Thaisarco and Chinese Yunnan Tin Company, and for tantalum the Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry, also from China. For gold, DW identified the Gasabo Gold Refinery in Rwanda and the African Gold Refinery in Uganda.
"Volkswagen Group does not have a direct business relationship with any of the listed companies or mines," the statement said, and that the "complexity of global supply chains" was responsible.

Volkswagen is the only major European car manufacturer that provides insight into where it sources its 3TG metals. This transparency has made this analysis possible, while other car manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Renault and Stellantis say nothing publicly about where 3TG metals in their cars come from.
Sasha Lezhnev, a senior policy advisor at the investigative news platform The Sentry in Washington, D.C., thinks the car industry is "not paying enough attention to what is happening in Congo."
"Companies such as Volkswagen need to do their best and pay attention to the war," he told DW.

Carmakers' dirty supply chains
Volkswagen, Europe's largest car manufacturer, says that by 2030, at least 70% of the cars it sells in Europe must be electric. This means more electronics, more wiring, more 3TG metals.
On the other end of the supply chain is DRC. But it's been shaken by violence, especially in the resources-rich east of the country, bordering Rwanda.
Minerals are smuggled from eastern DRC into Rwanda, where they are mixed with local production and exported worldwide, United Nations experts say. According to them, the Rwanda-backed rebel group M23 earns around $800,000 a month from this trade.

To expose this system, DRC filed criminal complaints against Apple, an end user of 3TG minerals, in a landmark case in 2024. DRC accused the smartphone maker of complicity in the conflict minerals trade. Apple denied the accusations.
DW found that four tin and tantalum smelters named in DRC's criminal complaint in Belgium for their links to smuggled minerals also appear on VW's 3TG suppliers list. These include Malaysia Smelting Corporation, Thaisarco, Yunnan Tin Company and Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry.
VW's supply chain also includes gold from Gasabo Gold Refinery in Rwanda and African Gold Refinery in Uganda, which have processed gold smuggled from DRC, according to the EU. The former refinery was sanctioned by the EU in early 2025.

In 2023 and 2024, Volkswagen's supply chain included gold from the Sudan Gold Refinery in Khartoum, which at the time was controlled by the Sudanese paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The group has been accused of genocide by the US.
"This means that Volkswagen's supply chain is contaminated with conflict gold and there is a huge risk that it's indirectly funding those conflicts," says Marc Ummel, a raw materials researcher at the Swiss nonprofit organization Swissaid.
"It's very surprising and disappointing that [VW] has some of the worst, most notorious smelters in the world in its supply chain," he told DW.


A patchy certification system
Companies in need of 3TG resort to business initiatives to check their sourcing policy through the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). Smelters have their procedures checked by independent audit agencies. If everything is in order, they receive a positive assessment by the RMI.
Volkswagen is also a member of RMI. In its code of conduct VW says that its suppliers may only use raw materials from smelters and refineries that can present a relevant audit.
But not all of the suppliers adhere to that. From all 344 entities that supplied Volkswagen with 3TG in 2024, only 61% were assessed by the RMI. This number has been decreasing. Some companies don't present any certificate of quality at all.
VW says working with RMI-checked smelters is its "objective" and that it "works to encourage and support suppliers" in completing the assessment.
The EU established rules for monitoring imports of 3TG metals in 2021, but they have so far not changed anything on the ground in Congo, according to a study conducted by the European Commission.
Only direct importers of the materials to the EU have to comply with new rules. When companies such as Volkswagen often do not import the materials themselves, the rules don't apply to them directly.
In Germany, the ruling coalition of the conservative CDU/CSU bloc and the center-left SPD pledged in their 2025 coalition agreement to prevent "excessive regulations" on conflict minerals by the EU.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[IT之家 10 月 3 日消息，随着近两年 AI 的迅猛发展，关于 AI 替代人类就业成了热门话题。微软联合创始人比尔・盖茨曾预测，AI 将取代人类大多数工作，但将保留某些专门为人类设计的任务。他开玩笑说，“没有人愿意看计算机打棒球”。
然而英伟达 CEO 黄仁勋有不同的看法，他认为人类未来将会更加“忙碌”。AI 即将创造新的工作领域，这些领域将需要人类的干预、创造力和监督。

黄仁勋在今年 9 月福克斯商业频道的采访中解释说，虽然 AI 将自动化重复性任务，但它也将创造全新的工作领域，这些领域将需要人类的创造力和监督，比如机器人、生物技术和设计等行业，在这些领域，AI 将扮演合作伙伴而非替代者的角色，从而增加现有的工作机会。
根据黄仁勋的说法，即将到来的创新浪潮将扩展人类可以构建的范围，而不是减少他们参与的需求。
IT之家注意到，在英国 Channel 4 News 今年 9 月的一次采访中，黄仁勋还称，AI 时代的真正赢家不会是办公室工作人员，而是电工、水管工和木匠。他认为每个经济体的技术工人领域将迎来繁荣，他认为 AI 数据中心的扩建将需要持续扩张，“每年都会翻倍，翻倍，再翻倍”。]]></content>

輝達（NVIDIA）來台設立總部「T17、T18基地」卡關，親近輝達的知情人士向本報透露，輝達明確表達「由新光人壽先興建、後移轉的方案」是絕對不可行，甚至T17、T18基地還陷入了政治議題，卡在政治口水戰，對此非常失望。


知情人士透露，外界盛傳，輝達與新壽「北士科T17、T18基地」MOU 30日到期後，有三大解決方案，包括「合議移轉方案」、「先建後移方案」、「解約返還方案」，其中針對先建後移方案，輝達有話想說，這方案絕對不可行。

知情人士透露，輝達不同意，主要有兩大原因，第一是輝達對建築設計要求高，已經找好建築團隊，營造工程等都會由輝達發包，若有第三人在中間協調，屆時興建過程容易不符合預期，且責任難歸咎。


第二是「北士科T17、T18基地」延伸成為政治攻防戰，不想被牽連到複雜的政治議題，因為輝達希望能夠快速完成總部興建的計劃，不希望因為政治議題遞延時程。


最後，知情人士透露，事實上，這個案子已經走到最後階段，輝達想來台設立總部，但卻因此卡關，感到非常失望。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[熱帶氣旋麥德姆成為今年第十二個影響本港的熱帶氣旋，打破歷年來最多熱帶氣旋影響本港的紀錄。

每年5月至11月是風季，在立秋過後形成的熱帶氣旋，一般俗稱「秋颱」。在秋季吹襲的熱帶氣旋，或者會與東北季候風，同時影響華南沿岸，帶來較強的風力，路徑和強度變數較大。現時只是十月初，天文台指，即使到十一月都有機會打風。

在2022年11月，強烈熱帶風暴尼格吹襲，天文台一度需要發出八號烈風或暴風信號。超強颱風雷伊在2021年，橫過南海並靠近廣東沿岸，天文台在12月20日發出一號戒備信號，是自二戰後最遲發出的警告信號，打破了超強颱風艾瑪1974年12月初創下的紀錄。

截至九月，今年累計有11個熱帶氣旋影響本港，平了1974年一年內發出最多警告信號的紀錄。

今年先後有韋帕、塔巴、樺加沙三個風暴，天文台需要發出八號烈風或暴風信號，其中，韋帕和樺加沙更帶來十號颶風信號。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[周五美市看什么（SPH Media Limited）
 星期五（10月3日）重点：

 
美国华尔街股市主要股指期货在星期五（10月3日）走高。市场投资者继续不被美国政府关门之事影响。原定在今晚较迟时候发布的美国9月份就业报告因政府关门而推迟发布。
在7时截稿时，标准与普尔500指数期货上升18.10点或0.27％，报6733.50点；以科技股为主的纳斯达克100指数期货起68.50点或0.28％，报24961.30点；重量级的道琼斯指数期货也升高131.40点，报46651.60点。
在科技板块的支撑下，华尔街股市三大股指在隔夜（星期四）小幅上涨，创下收盘新高。隔夜也是美国政府关门的第二天。由于无法取得官方的9月份就业报告数字，市场投资者只能从其他来源获取信息。根据全球职介公司Challenger Gray & Christmas的一份报告，美国雇主在9月份宣布的裁员人数减少，但开年至今的招聘人数是2009年以来的最低水平。
标准与普尔500指数隔夜微起4.15点，闭市报6715.35点。道琼斯指数上升78.62点，闭市报46519.72点。纳斯达克100指数也升高0.37％或91.90点，以24892.76点收市。
美国股市隔夜的交易保持活跃，交易所的总成交量是187亿7000万股，比过去20天的188亿3000万股平均成交量稍微少一些。
盘前交易重点：

 
晶片设备制造商Applied Materials的股价在今晚盘前下跌2.90%，截稿时报217.10美元。该公司表示，美国新的出口条规将导致该公司第四季度收入减少1亿1000万美元，2026年收入减少6亿美元。Applied Materials说，美国工业和安全局（Bureau of Industry and Security）扩大了受限制公司的名单。因为受到限制，公司原本不需要许可证就可以出口给中国客户的产品和服务减少了。
彭博社报道说，波音777x客机的交货期将推迟至2027年，导致波音公司股价在今晚盘前小幅退低0.01%，截稿时报217.41美元。彭博社援引知情人士的话说，777x客机的首次商业飞行将改为2027年初进行，而不是明年。
西方石油（Occidental Petroleum）的股价在今晚盘前回弹1.81%，截稿时报45.03美元。西方石油将把它的石化业务，以97亿美元的价格卖给伯克希尔哈撒韦公司（Berkshire Hathaway）。这个消息导致西方石油股价在隔夜下跌7.3%。
星期五下文我们来看看电动车制造商特斯拉（Tesla）的最新月份与季度交货量数字。今晚盘前该股起1.15%，截稿时报441.00美元。
盘前活跃股按序：Plug Power、特斯拉、英特尔（Intel）、英伟达（Nvidia）和QuantumScape Corp。截稿时，这五只活跃股的股价全部上升。

 

 之前华尔街分析师对特斯拉的第三季度交货量的共识是44万3000辆，而特斯拉发布的交货量比这个数字高出5万4000多辆。（法新社）

特斯拉（Tesla Inc）
（纳斯达克证券交易所代码：TSLA）
美国电动车制造商特斯拉隔夜发布的交货量，超出市场分析师的普遍预期。美国政府对电动车政策的改变，无疑推动特斯拉的交货量大幅“超出预期”。尽管如此，特斯拉的9月份以及第三季销售成绩还是令人另眼相看的。
在第三季里，特斯拉总共交出49万7099辆电动车，创下公司的历史新高。这个数字比第二季的38万4122辆增加29%，比2024年第三季的46万2890辆多出7.4%。之前市场分析师预计，特斯拉的交货量大概会取得约5%的增长。
这次特斯拉交货量激增，主要是美国总统特朗普在7月份生效的税收和支出法案“带动”的。特朗普把符合条件的电动车可享受到的7500美元联邦购置税抵免删除，而正式删除的时间是今年第四季开始。换言之，因为这个税收抵免在9月底到期，所以消费者都抢在截止日期到之前买车，刺激了9月份的销量。
目前美国的政策变化很快，不少分析师都表示这使得预测变得困难。之前华尔街分析师对特斯拉的第三季度交货量的共识是44万3000辆，而特斯拉发布的交货量比这个数字要高出5万4000多辆。
Future Fund Active ETFs联合创始人布莱克（Gary Black）之前的估计是众多分析师当中较为偏高的。他估计交货量是47万辆。在FactSet收集到的预测数字当中，最高的预测是48万辆。但特斯拉的表现还是超出这个最高预期。
不过因为特斯拉的出货量在第一季和第二季接连下滑，尽管这次特斯拉终于恢复增长，但截至9月底，特斯拉今年交出的121万7902辆电动车，仍比去年同期下降5.9%。
在股价方面，过去一个月特斯拉股价整体走高。在9月份，它的股价上涨了33%。这主要是因为投资者对特斯拉第三季的交货量有所期待。虽然特斯拉如投资者期望般表现大幅度超出预期，但它的股价在隔夜下跌5.11%至闭市的436美元。反映大盘的标准与普尔500指数和重量级的道琼斯指数则在隔夜小幅走高。
截至隔夜为止，特斯拉的股价在过去三个月上涨52%；开年至今上涨14%；在过去12个月上涨78%。电动车交货量并非推动股价上涨的主要因素。相反的，投资者越来越关注特斯拉的人工智能机遇。特斯拉在今年6月在德克萨斯州奥斯汀推出了人工智能训练的无人驾驶出租车服务，并计划尽快将它扩展到全美各地，以及该公司计划在2026年开始大量销售经过人工智能训练的人形机器人，这些都是投资者更感兴趣的。]]></content>

        <link href="https://www.yicai.com/news/102852590.html"/>
        <updated>2025-10-03T11:32:07.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[节后首日港股倾向于下跌，一周内“日历效应”将逐渐消散。
   
在周四大涨后，港股市场今日未能延续涨势，出现明显回调。恒生科技指数低开低走，截至收盘，恒生指数收盘跌0.54%，恒生科技指数跌0.9%。汽车板块成为拖累大盘的主要力量，其中，比亚迪股份（01211.HK）下跌3.95%，“蔚小理”等造车新势力也跌超2%。黄金股走势由强转弱。
市场波动中亮点犹存。氢能概念股逆势走强，上海电气（02727.HK）大涨13%，刷新逾10年收盘新高。
回顾本轮行情，9月港股表现亮眼，恒生科技指数累计上涨13.9%，在全球主要股指中大幅领跑。对于后市走势，机构观点出现分歧。业内认为，短期来看，节后首日港股大涨后倾向于调整，一周内“日历效应”将逐渐消散。但中长期而言，港股“下行有底”。
暴涨后回落
在此前连续多个交易日大涨后，10月3日港股市场大幅回调。恒生科技指数低开低走，开盘不久后，跌幅扩大至2%，恒指跌超1%。截至收盘，恒生指数收盘跌0.54%，恒生科技指数跌0.9%。截至目前，富时中国A50指数期货下跌0.31%。
板块方面呈现明显分化。截至周五收盘，汽车与零配件、硬件设备、石油石化等板块跌幅居前；电力设备、核电等板块逆市走强。
其中，汽车与零配件跌幅居前，该板块整体跌超2%，成为拖累大盘的主要力量。截至收盘比亚迪股份下跌3.95%，理想汽车-W（02015.HK）、小鹏汽车W（09868.HK）、蔚来-SW（09866.HK）跌超2%。消息面上看，比亚迪股份10月1日在港交所公告，9月新能源汽车销量39.63万辆，去年同期销量41.94万辆；本年累计销量326万辆，累计同比增长18.64%。
黄金股走势由强转弱。截至收盘，潼关黄金（00340.HK）、灵宝黄金（03330.HK）、中国黄金国际（02099.HK）分别下跌4.17%、3.53%、2.23%。消息方面，国际金价早盘一度转跌至3884美元附近。
值得注意的是，主要科网股出现大幅波动。阿里巴巴-W一度快速跳水达4.7%，成为上午拉动恒生科技指数走低的力量之一。不过随后情形反转，截至收盘，阿里巴巴-W报收185港元/股，上涨1.09%。
有市场消息称，美国白宫及国会官员在过去数个月来一直审查苹果与阿里巴巴的AI合作计划，因苹果希望将人工智能Apple Intelligence引入中国，而阿里巴巴是合作伙伴之一。
与上述板块相比，周五港股市场氢能概念股多数逆势走强，上海电气股价大涨13%，刷新逾10年收盘新高。亿华通（02402.HK）涨超11%。根据上海电气消息，当地时间10月1日上午，罗马尼亚帕劳二期342兆瓦光伏总承包项目签约仪式举行。此次签约的帕劳二期342兆瓦光伏总承包项目是上海电气在罗马尼亚落地的第四个光伏项目。
后市行情如何演绎？
拉长时间线看，9月份，港股市场主要宽基指数继续收涨，其中恒生科技指数累计涨13.9%，在全球主要股指中大幅领涨，恒生指数累计涨7.1%，恒生国企指数累计涨6.8%。10月，港股市场能否延续涨势？
历史数据显示，港股在国庆长假期间存在显著的“日历效应”。华泰证券近期研报显示，2010年以来，恒生指数在国庆期间的上涨概率高达86.7%，涨幅中位数为2.1%，高于五一长假表现。港股在国庆期间呈现明显的“节前防御-节中上涨-节后切换”规律，节前南向资金大幅流入消费及防御板块，节中市场普涨，成长和消费板块领涨。
这一规律在今年再次得到部分印证。10月2日，港股三大指数高开高走。其中，恒生指数涨超431点，并突破27000点关口，创下年内新高，当日涨幅达1.61%；恒生科技指数表现更为强劲，当日收涨3.36%,盘中创年内新高；恒生国企指数当日也上涨1.77%。
但周五回调后，市场担忧后续走势。
展望后市，机构普遍认为短期承压、中长期向好。
华泰证券指出，2010年以来，节后第一天港股倾向于下跌（上涨概率未超过50%）。节后当天大多回撤、风格再度切换至防御，一周内“日历效应”消散。
中长期来看，业内认为相对乐观。中信建投首席经济学家黄文涛指出，本轮港股长周期牛市自去年四季度确立，当前走到中段左右。三大周期性因素中流动性周期目前最领先，估值周期也已经显著启动，盈利周期目前还刚刚启动，以结构性行业景气修复为主。
黄文涛进一步指出，从港股主要行业板块来看，目前PB分位数较高的板块有工业制品业、原材料、能源业和医疗保健业，而公用事业及地产PB处于较低水平。港股互联网所在的资讯科技业及新消费所在的非必需消费PB分位数仍存在上升空间，景气板块的估值修复有望持续带动港股整体估值。
东吴证券海外策略首席分析师陈梦指出，尽管短期港股有所调整，但仍在震荡上行趋势中，下行有底。其一，美联储降息落地，并不是利好彻底出尽。未来，全球资金会进一步流向全球股市，有一部分切入中国资产，但大规模流入港股还需更多基本面改善信号。其二，结构性行情下，港股未来上涨的动力主要来自产业面的好消息。建议自下而上寻找相对低估的个股，持续关注景气赛道，全球产业链共振行情方向。]]></content>

Sarah Mullally has been named as the new Archbishop of Canterbury on Friday, making her the first female leader of the Church of England in its 1,400-year history.
The former chief nursing officer for England will be confirmed as the church's top bishop at a legal ceremony in the coming months.
In her first words after confirmation of her appointment, Mullally said while the role is a "huge responsibility," she feels a sense of "peace and trust in God to carry me."
Mullally will legally become Archbishop of Canterbury at a ceremony in Canterbury Cathedral in January.
Spiritual leader of Anglican Church
Mullally takes over the role from Justin Welby, who resigned in November 2024 and left office in January 2025 after failures in handling an abuse scandal. 

Mullally will become the ceremonial head of 85 million Anglicans worldwide, but GAFCON — a grouping of conservative Anglican churches across Africa and Asia, criticized Mullally's appointment.
The group said her appointment showed that the English arm of the Church had "relinquished its authority to lead."
Although King Charles III is head of the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury is the most senior bishop and is the spiritual leader of the Church.


Reforms allowed a woman to take Archbishop role
Mullally was ordained as a priest in 2002 and became one of the first women to be consecrated as a bishop in the Church of England in 2015.
She served as Bishop of London since 2018 and has been known to be progressive, championing causes such as allowing blessings for same-sex couples in civil partnerships and marriages.
Eleven years ago reforms were introduced to allow a woman to the hold the office, meaning Mullally could become the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury.

"I want, very simply, to encourage the Church to continue to grow in confidence," she said in her first statement since the historic appointment.
"I look forward to sharing this journey of faith with the millions of people serving God and their communities in parishes all over the country and across the global Anglican Communion."
King Charles gave formal consent for appointment
As is tradition, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office formally announced Mullally's appointment after the formal consent of King Charles.
As monarch, Charles is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. The role was established in the 16th century after King Henry VIII broke from the Catholic Church.
"The Archbishop of Canterbury will play a key role in our national life. I wish her every success and look forward to working together," Starmer said in a statement.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[歡迎收看《世界觀》。

歐盟成員國領導人到丹麥哥本哈根，商討安全事務，其中一項迫切議題，是如何防範懷疑來自俄羅斯的無人機。有成員國建議，要盡快建立一道無形之牆，防禦無人機入侵及滋擾，但法國及德國就對此大潑冷水。

丹麥哥本哈根機場上周緊急關閉，航班暫停升降近四小時，原因是當局在機場附近發現兩至三架大型無人機。隨後丹麥國內再多四個機場，皆發現無人機蹤影，為安全起見要一度關閉。鄰國挪威亦有機場受不明無人機困擾。

這兩個北歐國家，沒有指明這些無人機是來自哪個國家，但丹麥肯定事件並非巧合，形容丹麥正面對「混合戰爭」。

丹麥首相弗雷澤里克森說：「我希望所有人承認這是一場混合戰爭，一天發生在波蘭，另一天發生在丹麥，下周可能發生在另一地方，看到破壞及無人機在飛翔。」

外界相信，這些無人機是來自俄羅斯，但沒有證據，而俄羅斯當局亦否認涉及事件。而較早前東歐的波蘭及羅馬尼亞，就直指俄方無人機入侵她們領空，波蘭更出動F-16戰機，擊落部分「不速之客」。

事件令人擔心，俄烏戰事會否開始蔓延到其他歐洲國家。在哥本哈根召開的歐盟領導人非正式會議，其中一項議題，便是討論如何面對無人機威脅。

歐盟及北約成員國，固然有完善的防空系統，但這些防空系統，主要是應對如戰機及導彈等大型武器的襲擊，如用這套系統防範敵方無人機，顯然是「用牛刀殺雞」。

例如以近一億美元的F-35戰機，去攔截僅數萬美元的無人機，仿如瓷器撼缸瓦，長遠對國防開支是極大負擔。而相對於戰機及導彈，由玻璃纖維或塑膠等物料製成的無人機，現有的軍事雷達根本難以偵測出來。

愛沙尼亞防長佩夫庫爾稱：「當我們談及低空偵測能力，所有北約國都有明顯差距，我們看到波蘭(被無人機入侵)事件，大部分的無人機沒有被偵測到，這差距我們一定要解決。」

故歐洲現急切需要的，不是昂貴的國防系統，而是合乎經濟效益的反無人機技術，加上無人機往往出現在鬧市，貿然用導彈截擊，會對民居造成危險。面對迫切難題，東歐及北歐多國近日提出要盡快建立「無人機牆」。

所謂「無人機牆」，並不是如美墨圍牆般的實體牆，而是一道「無形之牆」，據報將設於芬蘭、愛沙尼亞、拉脫維亞、立陶宛及波蘭邊境。這幅「無人機牆」的主要功能，是能準確偵測、追蹤及截擊不明來歷的無人機。但這仍屬初步構思，沒有提及建造時間及技術，包括偵測範圍，以及用何種武器作截擊等，更沒有提及建造費用。

但西歐國家卻質疑「無人機牆」的成效。有份出席非正式會議的法國總統馬克龍認為，歐洲需要是更先進的預警系統，以及加強遠程射擊的威懾力。德國防長認為，「無人機牆」需時最少三至四年才能建成，不能解決燃眉之急。

無論贊成或反對建立「無人機牆」的國家，都是流於紙上談兵。在這問題上，東、北歐與西歐國家有著明顯分歧，「無人機牆」若要成事，似乎先要打破歐洲國家之間的「分歧之牆」。

我們下星期繼續《世界觀》，觀世界。

据介绍，0816 马达是一颗超宽频脉冲马达，从 0809 的 ELA 第一代技术平台，升级为 1016 同款的第三代 ESA 超宽频硬件平台，IT之家附上具体升级要点如下：

马达振动强度升级：相比前代稳态振动量提升 48%，瞬态振动量提升 82%

马达响应速度升级：50ms“闪电级”响应，相比前代 85ms 的响应速度快 41%

本次 GT8 Pro 手机还将重点关注 FPS 射击游戏场景，可为用户带来全新的 FPS 游戏体验，可在枪械扫射、引擎轰鸣等长时振动场景中提供更强劲、更稳定的物理反馈。

王伟还透露，他们还在软件适配方面下了不少功夫，这次 GT8 Pro 不仅拥有系统级的拟真触感方案，还为多款主流游戏进行了深度适配，定制专属振动波形，提供细腻的“4D 振感”，可在部分 MOBA 手游中让玩家感受首杀、单杀、释放大招等多种情景下不同的振感效果。
值得注意的是，王伟还在上个月末透露，真我 GT8 Pro 手机将首发苍穹信号芯片 S1 和苍穹电竞五天线，支持 21 个 5G 频段、支持 n79 频段等。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[美國聯邦政府停擺持續，參議院今日將再次表決臨時撥款法案。

美國聯邦政府繼續停擺，公共服務受影響，多個國家公園仍然關閉，部分開放的亦未必有管理員當值。亞利桑那州的大峽谷國家公園有限度服務。

基於民主、共和兩黨在醫保相關福利等方面的分歧，參議院未能在聯邦政府資金耗盡前，通過新的臨時撥款法案，聯邦政府周三起，時隔近七年再次陷入停擺。

參議院周五將再次就臨時撥款法案投票，不過，就算未能通過，預計周末都不會開會，意味停擺可能持續至下周。

美國總統特朗普周四在社交平台發文表示，共和黨必須藉民主黨促成政府停擺的機會，清除枯枝、浪費和詐騙，省下數以十億計美元。

特朗普還指會與官員討論「臨時或永久」削減開支，屆時將裁減聯邦僱員、削減民主黨支持的項目，施壓要他們通過法案，以結束停擺。

白宮發言人萊維特說，整個白宮團隊正研究可以削減哪些政府職位，很可能有數以千計聯邦僱員被裁減。團隊亦正查找哪些機構跟政府的價值觀不一致，浪費公帑。

美國有線新聞網絡引述消息報道，白宮已草擬一份計劃裁員的機構名單，預計稍後公布。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[江西景德鎮一名賣炸雞的小販「雞排哥」，近日走紅，更帶動國慶長假期整個鎮的人流。

雞排哥說：「做你的，做完你的，我做你的。我要把它炸到位，我不到位，我是無法原諒我自己的。」

獨特的「棟篤笑式售賣」，讓景德鎮賣炸雞的小販李俊永，在網上走紅，人稱「雞排哥」，國慶期間有不少人慕名而來。

有旅客稱：「排了三個小時，終於吃上了。」

「雞排哥」擺檔的行人路，甚至被網民稱為「雞排大道」，排隊的人龍看不到盡頭，同時帶動旁邊攤販生意上升。在「雞排哥」擺檔的位置，當地政府在長假期前用了半日鋪設好道路，並增設垃圾桶、流動廁所等設備。

不過「人紅是非多」，國慶節未過半，已有不少質疑聲傳出。

有人說：「他怎麼不說話了？」

雞排哥表示：「其他的崗位可以替代，但是我這個崗位是無法替代的，我並不是炸雞排本身，我是把它當成我真正熱愛的一項事業去做。」

亦有人質疑，他用來炸雞的油是否安全，「雞排哥」這樣回應。

雞排哥回應：「這是剛剛才出來的原材料的檢測報告、成品的檢測報告、油的檢測報告，你們所吃到的每份東西，食品安全、食品衞生都是可以的。」

景德鎮在國慶節當日，酒店入住率多三成。雞排哥的「叫座力」，被官方認證為景德鎮文旅推薦官，在早前景德鎮的文旅座談會上，他的發言更被網民形容，「6元雞排講出了6億項目的氣魄」。

雞排哥表示：「現在我的主要意思就是說，一個是現場的秩序是必須要維護好，我的主旋律就是一點，就是讚美瓷都，弘揚的是一種積極向上的精神。」

有學者表示，近年民眾的旅遊觀念有轉變，很多年輕人旅遊不再去景點打卡，反而想去一些更小眾的地方，體驗當地的人情味。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[新一份《施政報告》提出，訂立加快發展北部都會區的專屬法例。有立法會議員關注，專屬法例能否加快處理北都土地業權爭議。

《施政報告》提出成立北都發展委員會，下設三個工作組，其中由財政司副司長黃偉綸領導的規劃及發展工作組，舉行首次會議。工作組特設專案監督辦公室，加快北都私人項目審批，目標年底前敲定和公布運作細節。

工作組成員之一的發展局局長甯漢豪，出席立法會一個委員會時，介紹局方訂立加快發展北都專屬法例，授權政府制訂簡化的法定程序等。

有議員關注，專屬法例能否處理北都部分土地涉及逆權侵佔等問題。

民建聯新界北議員劉國勳指出：「專屬法例是否可解決這些土地(問題)，釋放更多的土地潛力？否則現時的土地仲裁需時過長，不利北都發展。」

發展局局長甯漢豪表示：「都是想利用這次的專屬法例，其中一個環節，看看有沒有條款便利我們作業權查核。最勇猛的方法是，目前土地註冊處列出最新的業權人是誰，我們就信是誰。雖然我們未實行業權註冊制度，但為了賠償及加快速度，可否折衷地先用這個方法？」

另外，《施政報告》提出發展遊艇經濟，在香港仔避風塘等地增加遊艇泊位。不過，超強颱風樺加沙襲港期間，香港仔避風塘防波堤被沖毁，海水湧入附近的富麗敦海洋公園酒店。

有議員關注，當局如何加強防波堤應對極端天氣的威脅，局方這樣回應。

甯漢豪說：「我們設計防波堤，都是以最新的風浪和天氣變化的數據去設計。這個防波堤也給了我們一個契機，除了擴展我們公用的避風塘，正正在平靜的水體預留泊位，做遊艇會設施，及岸上相應的康樂設施。」

她預計最快2027年，就香港仔避風塘的防波堤及遊艇設施招標。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[多區都有不同主題中秋燈飾，不過隨著風暴麥德姆迫近，部分節慶活動可能受到影響。

灣仔利東街、藍屋、銅鑼灣維園都已掛上中秋花燈，提醒大家中秋佳節即將來臨。

啟德這個5米高的巨型玉兔與圓月裝置，吸引不少人來「打卡」。主辦方預料可能有颱風吹襲，玉兔裝置將會將周六至周日暫時收起。

一連八日內地黃金周橫跨中秋節，有旅客專程來港過節，但迎月夜可能都受風暴影響。

海南旅客余先生說：「香港中秋的氛圍，來感受氛圍。有颱風的話就待在酒店，沒颱風就多出來逛幾天。」

天津旅客馬小姐稱：「覺得可能有遺憾，但在室內逛逛也是不錯的選擇。」

中秋傳統節慶活動大坑舞火龍，周日中秋迎月開始一連三日舉行，周一中秋當晚會按傳統舞入維園。龍身已製作好，這日用鐵線將龍身繞緊，作最後衝刺。準備工夫做足，但天氣難料，主辦方指有兩手準備。

大坑舞火龍總指揮張國豪指出：「若真的很大雨，我們會等等、先不起龍，細雨點或停雨才起龍。火龍最標誌是插在上面的1.2萬枝香，這些光令火龍很好看。若真正的大火龍，下雨會很失色，萬一到時真的不幸運，看看我們LED版的小火龍可否都服務觀眾。」

他又指，舞火龍時使用的龍鼓，不能被水沾濕，已經有額外準備。但如遇上八號或以上信號、紅雨或黑雨，舞火龍活動唯有取消。

 Merz says 'liberal way of life is under attack'
    
Speakers at the commemoration of German Unity Day highlighted the ways in which democracy is under attack as they reflected on the 35 years since the historic German reunification.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said "new alliances of autocracies are forming against us" and "our liberal way of life is under attack, from both outside and within."
Merz said European countries "must relearn how to defend ourselves" by "deterring our adversaries from further aggression."

French President Emmanuel Macron echoed the sentiment, calling on Europeans to mount a "resurgence" to "rebuild a 21st-century democracy."
If not, Europe would risk becoming "a continent, like many others, of conspiracy theorists, extremes, noise and fury," Macron said.
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier spoke about his concern in seeing that "the political center has less and less support, especially in the east of our country, and this at a time when our democracy as a whole is being increasingly challenged." 
Steinmeier said political forces that disdain democracy, want to undermine its institutions and poison political debates with hatred were seeing greater success, in a veiled reference to the rising popularity of the far-right Alternative for Germany.
"Let's not allow our democracy to be further damaged," said Steinmeier. "Let us stand against it."

 French President Emmanuel Macron: Europe also unified 35 years ago

French President Emmanuel Macron called it a great honor to be invited to celebrate 35 years of German unity, saying he was "humbled" by the invitation.
Macron spoke about the significance of German unity, describing reunification as "a turning point in history."
Macron said he was 12 years old on October 3, 1990, but nevertheless realized that "something special was happening."
He said it wasn't just Germany that unified 35 years ago — but Europe, as well.
"This had appeared so impossible. Imagine 75 years ago, how anybody could have imagined that our enemies that we waged wars against could be friends," Macron said.
The fragility of peace and prosperity 
Despite the promise of peace and prosperity that came with unification and everything that has been achieved, Macron said, the sithation "remains fragile."
"There are rifts, fractures in our democracies," he said. He added that what happened 35 years ago needs to be remembered.
"Our generation now has a choice, to be doubting, to be fatigued, to choose extremes that are fake promises or do we want to stand up and live with our new era and make it a bold, determined era, together," Macron said to applause.

 Germany celebrating 35 years of 'being united in peace' — Merz

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has been speaking to people who have gathered in Saarland to mark the 35th anniversary of reunification.
The guest of honor is French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte.
"We are celebrating the 35th year of being united in peace. For decades we were divided, but soon we will have lived in one country as long as we had been living in separate countries," Merz said in his address.
Merz said the day was a "festive occasion" and looked back on how much had changed since the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification.
Merz spoke about the need for a "new unity" in Germany and asked what type of country Germany wanted to be going forward.
"New alliances of autocracies are forming against us and attacking liberal democracy as a way of life," Merz said.
"The global economic order is being rewritten. Customs barriers are being erected and selfishness is growing," he added. "This too is weakening us economically."
The German leader spoke about the impact that irregular migration was having on society.
"Years of irregular, undirected migration to Germany have polarized our country and dug new divisions into our society," Merz said while asking Germans to recognize the value of living in a democracy governed by the rule of law.
"Politics, the state, the government have their responsibility," he said. "But the scale of the challenge must be understood by us all, by every citizen in our country."

 German interior minister says drone sightings a 'wake-up call'
    
German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt told the mass-market daily Bild that the drone incident in Munich was a "wake-up call."
"The drone sightings over Munich are another wake-up call: The race between drone threats and drone defense is becoming increasingly fierce," Dobrindt told the country's highest-circulation publication.
"We now need more funding, support, and research — nationally and at the European level," Dobrindt said.
German authorities have launched a search to identify the origin of the drones.

 Flights resume at Munich airport after drone sightings trigger overnight closure
    
Germany's Munich airport restarted flights on Friday after drone sightings forced its closure overnight.
Its the latest disruption at a European airport and follows a string of similar incidents.
Munich airport was forced to close its airspace on Thursday night after several drone sightings caused more than than 30 flights to be cancelled or diverted.
More than 3,000 passengers stranded.
A spokesperson for German flagship carrier Lufthansa said "flight operations have since resumed according to schedule."
"Nineteen Lufthansa flights were affected — either cancelled or re-routed — because of the the airport suspension," the spokesperson said.
Aviation operations have been impacted at airports in Denmark, Norway and Poland with flights suspensions due to unidentified drones.
While authorities in Germany have not publicly blamed anyone for the Munich drone incident, some European officials have suggested Russia was behind other recent airspace violations.
"Russia tries to test us. But Russia also tries to sow division and anxiety in our societies," European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday.

 German Unity Day — Celebrations marking 35 years since reunification
    
Germany is celebrating what is considered to be its most important public holiday, that being German Unity Day.
On October 3, 1990, East Germany and West Germany united to become the Federal Republic of Germany, ending a separation of the two since World War II.
Each year on this day, one of the federal states organizes a larger, official festival — typically in its state capital.
This year's main event is being held the German city of Saarbrücken, in the southwestern state of Saarland bordering France.
The official program runs from October 2 to October 4 and promises "entertainment, art and culture, culinary specialties and tourism, as well as democratic exchange." 
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will be marking the day along with guest of honor, France's Persident Emmanuel Macron.
"35 years of German unity are a reason to celebrate. The reunification was not a given, but the work of courageous people who stood up for freedom and democracy," Merz posted on social media platform X, ahead of the event
"It remains our task to come together: in East, West, North, and South. Our diversity makes us strong," the German leader added. 

Merz will later head to eastern Germany in the evening for a concert in Halle an der Saale.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[除了通过被污染的食物进行传播之外，诺如病毒也会发生直接的人际之间的传播。“一旦在船上发生疫情，很难控制住。”
   
近日， 美国疾控中心（CDC）通报，一艘载有近2000人的皇家加勒比邮轮 “海洋小夜曲号”在航行途中发生诺如病毒暴发，船上约5%的乘客出现腹泻、呕吐等感染症状。这也让旅行中的传染性疾病防控成为全球关注的焦点。
专家解释称，由于邮轮空间较为封闭，一旦暴发疫情，病毒蔓延速度会很快。“在这艘船上，仅5%的感染比例应该说是不算高。”复旦大学附属华山医院感染科副主任王新宇对第一财经记者表示。

不过有船上乘客表示，一些人因为害怕被强制隔离，出现症状也可能隐瞒，因此实际的感染人数预计会更多。据当地媒体报道，目前这艘发生疫情的邮轮已经停靠迈阿密港口。
王新宇表示，诺如病毒的传播力极强，对环境抵抗力强，在0℃至60℃环境中均可存活，全年均可发生感染，尤其高发于秋冬交替的季节。
除了通过被污染的食物进行传播之外，诺如病毒也会发生直接的人际之间的传播。“一旦在船上发生疫情，很难控制住。”王新宇表示，“对于预防而言，勤洗手，食物尽量不要生食，是最主要的防护措施。”
美国CDC称，今年美国邮轮已经发生过19次疫情，其中14次由诺如病毒传播导致。如何加强邮轮的卫生防疫也是控制疫情的关键措施。
对于邮轮公司而言，一旦发生疫情，将会启动紧急响应程序，例如加强环境消毒，对患病乘客和船员进行隔离，并采取减少人员聚集措施，如关闭泳池和公共用餐区域等。
目前尚无针对诺如病毒的疫苗或特异性抗病毒治疗方法。不过这种疾病通常是自限性的，对于大多数健康的成年人而言，症状持续一到三天。需要警惕的是，呕吐和腹泻可能导致脱水，这也是最严重的并发症。因此对于某些面临诺如病毒感染的高风险人群，如幼儿，老年人、孕妇以及免疫系统较弱的人，仍需要及时的医疗救治。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[IT之家 10 月 3 日消息，玩家 Natalie 昨天发布播客，展示了她用乐高 GameBoy 玩具魔改出的掌机，可以玩《俄罗斯方块》游戏。

Natalie 表示，她在这款乐高玩具刚推出的时候就决定要将它塞入一块电路板，后来她看到实物图片时才意识到，这款玩具后部的卡带插槽空间足够放下一块主板，由此她决定真的动手做出这款魔改掌机。
随后她买来了乐高玩具和 GameBoy Pocket 掌机的 CPU，采用 GameBoy Pocket 改造的原因主要是因为这款掌机的零件相比原版 GameBoy 更便宜、更容易买到，且相比原版 GameBoy，主板的集成度更高，利好这种利用极限空间的改造工作。

后续她针对乐高玩具的有限空间设计出了新主板，并根据以前的项目整合电源电路，将原本是硬件开关的电源按钮换成电子式开关，并塞下了软包电池，还将充电方式改为了 USB-C 接口。

来到按键部分，这名玩家将原版玩具的按键方块配上 3D 打印组件，最后成功接入主板，并装上一块自带背光的屏幕，真的让一个玩具变成了一台能玩的掌机。

目前这台掌机能玩《俄罗斯方块》游戏，还有一些小细节需要修补，Natalie 承诺将在项目完成后公开制作过程。

IT之家注：GameBoy 是任天堂在 1989 年发售的第一代便携式掌上游戏机，由横井军平设计，虽然并没有亮眼的硬件配置，但凭借《精灵宝可梦》等游戏阵容和较长的电池续航打败了世嘉 GameGear 等竞品，成为了 90 年代的一种代表性符号。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[內地國慶中秋長假期未到一半，零售業界指已經有好消息，珠寶、化妝品店生意都有增長，酒店業界就指，遊客區酒店入住率逾九成。

名店林立的尖沙咀廣東道人頭湧湧，不少店舖門外都大排長龍。

大連旅客李小姐稱：「買了一個手袋，應該是兩萬多元，其實還好，對比國內其實還好。」

內地旅客彭小姐指出：「有喜歡的就會買，因為香港的貨會比較齊全。預算，就要看丈夫的預算。」

今年十一長假期，首兩天有45.4萬人次內地旅客入境，較去年同期多百分之三。第三日截至下午四時，累計已多過去年首三日。

旺丁又是否旺財呢？零售界立法會議員邵家輝指，遊客區的珠寶、化妝品店都「報喜」。

自由黨批發及零售界議員邵家輝說：「遠程過來，乘高鐵或飛機，與平常周五、周末從深圳來的旅客不同。深圳旅客來得較密，遠程旅客一年僅能來一兩次，藉這機會買心儀產品。」

至於酒店，業界指，尖沙咀、銅鑼灣等旅遊區入住率逾九成，其他區也有八成幾。他們一家會留港五天。

內地旅客余先生表示：「國慶節本來價格會高一點、正常的。(酒店)大概一千多(一晚)、還好。」

武漢旅客陳小姐說：「主要是因為國慶，它的房價太貴，不然我可以住一晚。」

酒店業主聯會指，大部分酒店營業額有一成幾升幅。

酒店業主聯會執行總幹事徐英偉表示：「較多旅客預早訂房，升幅當中不少是四、五星級酒店，旅客見到香港是有不同酒店、不同價位、不同服務可選擇，吸引所有類型旅客來港。」

徐英偉又指，希望政府能加強宣傳中長線旅遊，聚焦香港不同內容體驗，鼓勵旅客留港過夜。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[IT之家 10 月 3 日消息，据人形机器人场景应用联盟今日公布的统计数据，2025 年 9 月全球共有超过 21 起相关融资事件发生，披露融资总额突破 100 亿元人民币，创下单月融资历史新高。
值得注意的是，本轮融资呈现出显著的集中化趋势：美国初创公司 Figure 单独获得超 10 亿美元（IT之家注：现汇率约合 71.25 亿元人民币）的巨额融资，占据当月融资总额的七成。

人形机器人场景应用联盟认为，整体来看，这不仅凸显了全球资本对头部玩家的高度聚焦，也映射出行业在技术突破与商业化探索进入关键拐点后，正加速分化与洗牌的态势。
据央视新闻报道，在今年 9 月国新办举行的“高质量完成‘十四五’规划”系列主题新闻发布会上，工信部部长李乐成表示，中国具备人形机器人从关键芯片到部组件，到整机的全产业链制造能力。
据央视财经今年 8 月报道，据预测，人形机器人 2025 年全年销售突破 1 万台，同比增长 125%。可以预见，未来人形机器人产业市场规模可达万亿级。
埃隆・马斯克则认为，智能人形机器人的数量最终将远远超过人类人口。此外，每个行业也会有大量机器人为人类提供产品和服务。特斯拉的人形机器人 Optimus 预计今年将迎来首批“军团”。今年早些时候的一次全员大会上，马斯克还向特斯拉员工暗示，公司明年将尝试生产约 5 万台 Optimus 机器人。]]></content>

2024年全球經濟穩健成長，全球家庭金融資產表現豐碩，台灣亦不遑多讓。Ludovic Subran指出，台灣以高達167,530歐元的人均金融資產淨值，再次成為亞洲第二富裕的經濟體，大幅領先日本，此外2024年台灣家戶的金融資產總額勁升11.9%，表現同樣亮眼。此成長動能歸功於資產類別的「證券」，繳出亮眼的兩位數成長，其反映台灣股市的強勁表現，成為台灣家戶資產組合中僅次於存款的第二大資產類別（存款與證券分別占家戶總額比率為35%、34%）。

然而，壽險與退休金的成長速度最慢僅4.3%，主要是受到壽險準備金制度變動影響，使其占比降至25%。同時，雖然總負債在房貸推動下增加9.6%，債務比持續高於90%，不過台灣總金融資產/GDP比率達630%，相較面臨高債務比的韓國（214.7%）與泰國（149.7%），台灣展現穩健的財務基礎。


安聯集團每年發布「全球財富報告」，安聯人壽今年首次擴大舉辦「安聯人壽經濟趨勢論壇」，近250位金融保險及產業人士到場，關注全球經濟走勢及展望。本場論壇以「全球資產洞察 台灣金融新局」為主題，除首度邀請Ludovic Subran來台之外，還邀集前行政院副院長施俊吉、安聯收益成長基金投資首席Justin Kass、品浩太平洋投資管理公司董事總經理暨投資組合經理人張冠邦，共同探討全球經濟與金融環境的變化，探討資產管理、投資配置與財富傳承的策略。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[據報美國波音的777X飛機將再度推遲交付，預計損失最多40億美元。

原定2020年開始交付的波音777X系列飛機，正式落地起飛的時間表再度被押後。《彭博》報道，最先購買此機型的德國漢莎航空，在機隊規劃中，將777X的引入時間推遲到2027年。

至於這款系列飛機的最大客戶阿聯酋航空，在2027年之前，都不會將此機型列入機隊。

波音延後交付777X系列飛機有跡可尋。國泰航空在三月公布去年業績時，已將十二年前訂購的21架777-9型客機，接收時間表延後兩年，至2027年或之後，並在八月宣布再增購多14架。

自2018年以來，737 MAX接連發生重大事故後，波音面對美國航空監管部門，更嚴格的生產限制及適航認證程序。

波音行政總裁奧特伯格上月亦承認，777X飛機認證進度落後，但強調沒有發現新的技術問題。

報道指出，777X項目處於長期虧損狀態，意味波音無法透過製造及銷售首500架飛機，來收回開發成本。

分析員估計，今次延遲交付，會令波音錄得最多40億美元非現金開支。公司本月二十九日公布第三季業績時，料將交代延遲交付的程度和成本。

分析認為，波音及歐洲的空中巴士，多年來一直是飛機市場的勁敵，但波音飛機近年事故頻生，令空中巴士的市佔率一直領先。而777X系列被視為波音在長途機市場中，具有重大的戰略和財務意義，但交付一再推遲，令波音難以扭轉劣勢。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[南韓首爾再有反華示威，總統李在明早前表明，要堅決消除有損國家利益和形象的歧視性集會。中國駐南韓大使館發聲明，表明嚴正立場。

南韓保守派團體「自由大學」和反選舉舞弊團體周五下午，在首爾東大門站出發，以「永不投降」為主題，遊行至鐘路區光化門廣場。

遊行人士手持反華標語和美韓同盟旗幟，高呼「赤色分子滾出大韓民國」、「逮捕李在明、釋放尹錫悅」等口號，全程持續約兩小時。警方估計有四千人參與。

「自由大學」是保守派青年組織，主張恢復前總統尹錫悅的職務，維護自由民主主義、反對共產主義。該團體曾就警方限制其使用反華口號入稟法院，要求駁回。法院周四裁定中止警方有關限制，指警方未在法定時限內作出限制通告，屬程序不當。

因戒嚴令風波被捕的尹錫悅，曾聲稱中國干預南韓選舉，導致當地民眾反華情緒上升。

南韓上月29日起至明年6月30日，對中國團體旅客試行免簽政策，觸發反華示威升溫，聲稱免簽政策會導致3,000萬中國遊客湧入南韓，帶來大量犯罪者和基孔肯亞熱病毒，及對國家安全構成威脅等。

總統李在明早前表明，要堅決消除有損國家利益和形象的歧視性集會，絕不能對不文明、有損國格的行為坐視不理；強調政府對中國團體旅客試行免簽入境政策後，明洞商業街重現活力，南韓應熱情歡迎遊客，個別團體卻侮辱和誹謗他們，這種鬧事行為非常不妥當。

中國駐南韓大使館周四發聲明，批評個別政治人物散播不實訊息，個別極右團體多次舉行針對中國遊客的示威遊行，中韓雙方對此都明確表示反對。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[港鐵北環綫項目舉行啟動禮，主線及連接新皇崗口岸的支線，目標在2034年同步通車。當局形容項目達到多個突破，包括引入海內外精華的鐵路標準。

政府全速發展北部都會區，打通新界東西的骨幹鐵路北環綫正式啟動。運輸及物流局局長陳美寶、港鐵主席歐陽伯權等，到元朗水尾路出席啟動儀式。

港鐵主席歐陽伯權說：「現在處於的地方，正正就是北環綫項目建造工程第一個隧道，鑽挖機啟動豎井的工地，準備進行首段隧道建設工程，在此舉行啟動禮特別有意義，這個鐵路項目有助北都通達性及連繫。」

北環綫主線有五個站，連接屯馬綫的錦上路站，和東鐵綫新建的古洞站，途經凹頭、牛潭尾和新田。支綫屬於跨境鐵路，由新田站經洲頭、河套，跨境進入新皇崗口岸站，直入新皇崗口岸大樓。

項目會引入與鐵路相關的內地和外國標準、做法和資源，陳美寶形容是一項突破。

運輸及物流局局長陳美寶說：「我們希望為香港鐵路構建新鐵路標準，我們希望能夠將內地、海外，最好的精華、最好的標準，都能包含香港未來將建購構的新鐵路標準，從而結合內地建造的優勢，他們的團隊、器械，機器、設備也好，都能率先在北環綫主線第一期都能適時採用。」

她又指希望盡快與港鐵簽訂第二階段的協議。北環綫落成後，市民出行時間將大大縮短，由新田站往新皇崗站，只需要11分鐘。]]></content>

Asahi is one of the world's largest brewers

Japan is facing a shortage of Asahi products, including beer and bottled tea, as the drinks giant grapples with the impact of a major cyber-attack that has affected its operations in the country.
Most of the Asahi Group's factories in Japan have been at a standstill since Monday, after the attack hit its ordering and delivering systems.
Major Japanese retailers, including 7-Eleven and FamilyMart, have now warned customers to expect shortages of Asahi products.
In a statement on Friday, external, Asahi said it was "unable to provide a clear timeline for recovery" but had started "partial manual" processing of orders and shipments.


Asahi is the biggest brewer in Japan, but it also makes soft drinks and food products, as well as supplying own-brand goods to other retailers.
It owns Fullers in the UK and global brands including Peroni, Pilsner Urquell and Grolsch. However, Asahi has said that only its operations in Japan - which account for about half its sales - have been affected by the attack.
In its latest statement, Asahi said that as a result of containment measures following the attack, ordering and shipment systems in Japan had been affected and it was also unable to receive emails from external sources.
"Although system-based order and shipment processes remain suspended, ensuring product supply to customers has been set as our top priority and we have begun partial manual order processing and shipment," it said.
Asahi also said it was preparing to reopen its call centre operations next week.
Atsushi Katsuki, Asahi president and group chief executive, apologised for the disruption.
"We are making every effort to restore the system as quickly as possible, while implementing alternative measures to ensure continued product supply to our customers," he said.
In a statement on Thursday, FamilyMart - which is one of Japan's largest convenience stores - said its Famimaru range of bottled teas, which are made by Asahi, were expected to be in short supply or out of stock.
"We sincerely apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused," said FamilyMart, adding that it was working with Asahi to resume the sale of the products.
7-Eleven, the Japanese-owned global convenience store chain, has halted shipments in the country of Asahi products, including its popular Super Dry beer.
A spokesperson for 7-Eleven said its shops have been advised to expect a shortage of Asahi products.
Lawson, another major Japanese retailer, also said it expected some Asahi products to be in short supply from Friday.
The retailer said it planned to stock up on alternative products to minimise the impact on customers.
Japanese supermarket chain Life Cooperation also warned that Asahi products may soon go out of stock.

The Russian Armed Forces carried out a massive strike on Ukrainian defense industry enterprises and gas and energy infrastructure facilities, the Russian Ministry of Defense reported.


"Last night, the Russian Armed Forces launched a massive strike using long-range precision weapons as well as strike drones, against Ukrainian defense industry enterprises and the gas and energy infrastructure that supported them," the Russian ministry said in a statement.

The objectives of the strike were achieved, with all designated targets destroyed, the ministry said.

Russia's Battlegroup Tsentr has eliminated over 3,560 Ukrainian military personnel over the past week, the Russian Defense Ministry said.


"The enemy lost more than 3,560 servicepeople, five tanks, 16 armored fighting vehicles, including two US-made Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, 32 motor vehicles, and 14 artillery pieces," the ministry said in a statement.






Russia's Battlegroup Vostok has eliminated over 2,110 Ukrainian soldiers, the ministry also said, adding that Kiev has lost up to 1,760 soldiers in battles with Russia's Battlegroup Yug.

At the same time, Russia's Battlegroup Zapad has eliminated over 1,600 Ukrainian soldiers in past week, while Kiev has lost over 1,250 soldiers in clashes with Russia's Battlegroup Sever, the statement said.

Russia's Battlegroup Dnepr has eliminated up to 390 Ukrainian fighters over the past week, the ministry said.

Russian air defense systems shot down 945 Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles, 10 guided aerial bombs, 17 multiple rocket launchers, including US-made HIMARS MLRS and Czech-made Vampire MLRS launchers, and five Neptune long-range guided missiles in the past week, the ministry also said.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[中國乒乓大滿貫賽，「一姐」孫穎莎打足七局，驚險晉身女單四強。

八強繼續中國打吡，右方的「世一」孫穎莎有點運氣，觸網滴枱邊，首局刁時贏14-12。與世界第五的王藝迪，多次打到像平日練習推球，王藝迪轉直線，以11-4追平。

之前15次交手，孫穎莎贏11次，第三局又來練波時間，今次到孫穎莎轉左再右，以11-6再領先，對方就以11-7再追平，並贏多局14-12，超前局數3-2。

八強轉打七局四勝，馬上便打足七局，孫穎莎連贏11-3及11-8反勝，打了1小時10分鐘，贏局數4-3，自2023年開始交手七連勝，晉級四強。

紅衫的王楚欽及林詩棟，打入男雙決賽，面對國家隊友黃友政及溫瑞博，名牌效應必勝？對面不輕易就犯。林詩棟再殺後便反擊，兩板反拉令林詩棟落網。

首局中段較緊，不過男單世界頭兩位的王楚欽及林詩棟，始終先贏11-6。之後一局，他們落後1-10下，輸4-11。

兩位師兄生氣了，連殺三板得分，王楚欽及林詩棟連贏多兩局11-8及12-10，局數贏3-1，決賽繼續隊友「內訌」，與周啟豪及陳俊菘爭冠軍。]]></content>

經濟部3日表示，同意台電、台水、中油、台糖公司2025年調薪3.5%。經濟部說明，4家公司2024年度配合政府政策照顧民生、產業，協助穩定物價，減緩通膨；台電、台水及中油公司又在0403花蓮強震及凱米、山陀兒、康芮颱風等天災期間大規模動員搶修，於極短的時間內戮力搶修，加速復電復水及確保油料、天然氣供應無虞，以降低民眾面臨災害所帶來生活不便；至於台糖公司則是近10年均有盈餘繳庫，且積極配合政府政策。


經濟部考量4家公司2025年度調薪所需用人費用可於用人費支付限額內辦理，均不影響年度經營目標達成，亦不減少法定預算盈餘，且評估2025年度用人費率均不超過前3年平均用人費率，同意四家公司2025年調薪3.5%。

經濟部強調，特別是今年遭遇丹娜絲與樺加沙風災，國營事業全體總動員，包括台電全力搶修復電、台水多方努力確保供水復原、中油穩定能源供應、台糖支援物資調度，皆在最前線與時間賽跑。同仁們以專業和毅力守護民生與產業運作，經濟部感謝所屬國營事業同仁的辛勞付出。


經濟部補充，近年經濟景氣熱絡，科技業高薪爭才，國營事業招考報名人數及報到率日漸下滑，國營事業薪資待遇相較於產業界較不具競爭力，為照顧基層人員且吸引更多優秀人才投身服務，檢討調高新進人員起薪，預計2025年調薪幅度3.5%可使「具有證照之新進僱用人員起薪達到4萬元」，以利招募及留用人才。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[德國政府推出AI虛擬部長，是文化部長魏默的化身，發布的首段影片，以中文批評短片分享平台TikTok令青少年沉迷。

AI虛擬德國文化與媒體部部長魏默塔說：「你好，我是國家部長魏默，我至少是一個能說過百種語言，和不用清嗓子的版本。我不是深偽技術，而是一個政治實驗。我的同事也叫我『魏默塔』，沒錯，我是比原來的我更數碼化一些。」   

德國政府與歐洲人工智能公司，根據德國文化與媒體部部長魏默的外型及聲音，製作出AI虛擬部長「魏默塔」。

他在第一部影片裡，用中文、荷蘭文、波蘭文及法文發言。他提到在德國有約2,500萬活躍用戶的短片分享平台TikTok，裡面的影片讓年輕人沉迷，並向他們灌輸危險的潮流和扭曲的審美。

魏默塔指出：「因此我說，想在歐洲開展業務的企業，必須接受我們的歐洲規則，這意味著透明度、問責制、有效的青少年保護、公平，以及對言論自由和意見多樣性的真正貢獻。」

魏默表示，人工智能為創意、文化及溝通帶來契機，但同時也伴隨著深偽技術、虛假消息及不透明的潛在風險。他又指，「魏默塔」未來對外可以在社交平台中，快速地以多語言發表訊息，對內則可用於製作文化與媒體部的培訓影片。

早前，阿爾巴尼亞總理任命聊天機器人為「公共採購部長」，而烏克蘭外交部亦曾推出虛擬發言人。

有德國傳媒認為，這些「溝通工具」有潛在風險，社會一旦接受並習慣具公信力的政府用虛擬分身，現實和數碼空間的界線將變得模糊，以民主機制完成的決策，亦可能變成技術主導，削弱民主和人類扮演的角色。]]></content>

永慶房產集團業務總經理葉凌棋表示，根據六都地政局公布數據，2025年1至9月六都建物買賣移轉棟數較2024年同期減少27.9%，顯示2025年至今國內房市交易量低迷，市場觀望氣氛濃厚，若買賣雙方價格認知無法拉近，往往導致成交期間拉長甚至破局，如何打破目前的房市交易僵局，價格將是重要關鍵。


葉凌棋指出，隨著8月美國對等關稅上路，9月有新青安鬆綁與換屋族延長舊屋出售期限等房市政策的調整下，2025年9月六都、新竹縣市成交議價率仍在10%至13.2%的高檔水準，與去年6、7月房市高點相比，六都、新竹縣市成交議價率仍呈現擴大的趨勢。

他表示，在當前交易量偏低、房價跌幅有擴大跡象的情況下，認為第4季六都、新竹縣市跌幅約在1.5%~5%間，整體第4季季跌約2.5%~2.8%，認為在房價有明顯的降價幅度之下，「降價促成交」仍是目前房市交易關鍵。


葉凌棋說明，川普對等關稅政策正式落地實施，對於國內各產業的影響正陸續發酵中，將連帶影響內需與房市交易，雖然政府鬆綁新青安貸款限制，讓銀行不再受不動產放款比率上限約束，市場原本期待能釋出更多購屋資金，帶動買氣回升。


不過，葉凌棋表示，從近期交易量來看，回升幅度有限，顯示政策利多尚未完全轉化為實質需求。主因在於房價基期仍高，買方普遍預期後續仍有修正空間，加上利率環境趨緊、總價門檻居高不下，讓剛性需求雖然存在，但進場態度偏向謹慎。


葉凌棋強調，有鑑於此，永慶房產集團再度調降2025年房市交易量預測，依目前交易推估，預估2025年交易量至26.3~27.1萬棟間，恐跌破27萬棟大關，與2024年相比，量縮23%至25%左右，寫下自1991年有紀錄以來最大單年減幅紀錄。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[在台灣苗栗市，一名男子持刀當街隨機斬人，三人受傷，包括兩名小學生。據報兇徒十年前亦在同一地點隨機傷人，半年前才出獄。

周四下午三時許，48歲男兇徒駕電單車到苗栗市一間便利店外，先刺傷一名女童後，再襲擊正在報警的50歲男子。遇襲的男子負傷跑走，現場的小學生亦慌忙逃離。

兇徒之後挾持另一名女童，並用刀刺向其胸部。一名女教師衝出來，將女童救走。兇徒犯案後返回寓所，持刀坐在客廳，同趕到現場的警方對峙。警方之後將他制服，並以殺人未遂罪將他拘捕。

傷者包括一名50歲男子，他胸、背都有刀傷，正在深切治療部觀察。一名女童左胸被刺傷，亦在深切治療部留醫，另一名女童胸口及手部受輕傷。

警方指，48歲疑兇有傷人前科，2015年因吸毒後出現精神問題，在同一間便利店內持剪刀攻擊途人，連同警員在內造成四人受傷，判監八年多，今年三月才出獄。

台灣曾發生多宗隨機斬人案，最轟動分別有2014年，大學生鄭捷在台北捷運車廂內，持刀襲擊多人，造成4死、24傷，鄭捷在2016年伏法；以及是2016年在台北市內湖區，四歲女童「小燈泡」在街頭被一名男子斬頭殺死，兇徒被判無期徒刑。]]></content>

長榮航空董事長林寶水表示，長榮航空自1998年即開始經營達拉斯貨運航線迄今近30年，隨著達拉斯的經濟與人口快速增長，吸引多家企業進駐，這也成為我們決定開闢客運直飛航線的契機，桃園-達拉斯航線初期每周飛航3班，將於11月18日起增為每周5班，自12月15日起升級為每日飛航，屆時每周飛往北美的航班將達94班，是台灣飛航北美航班最密集的航空公司，旅客可利用擁有全球第三大客運旅運量的達拉斯‧沃斯堡國際機場，轉機前往美國國內及中南美洲各大城市，當然，未來也希望有更多的旅客透過達拉斯航線前來台灣轉往亞洲各大城市，藉以強化台灣轉運樞紐的核心地位。


為歡慶桃園－達拉斯航線首航，長榮航空特別將登機門打造成具有德州特色的鄉村風格酒吧，讓旅客在啟程前就感受到達拉斯的獨特魅力，除了設置達拉斯酒吧拍照區，讓旅客置身其中拍照打卡拿好禮，也將酒吧中著名的小遊戲搬進登機門，包含「飛鏢挑戰」及「一飛直達-達拉斯撞球」遊戲，只要完成挑戰就可以將限量好禮帶回家。此外，旅客只要身著牛仔服飾或攜帶牛仔配件，都可以獲得長榮航空限定的LOGO商品，同時長榮航空也特別準備首航限定好禮「Dallas丹寧棒球帽」送給每位搭乘首航班的幸運旅客，為達拉斯旅程增添更多驚喜。


桃園－達拉斯航線以全新三艙等的波音787-9機型執飛，配有全新第四代豪華經濟艙，為旅客帶來多元選擇與更舒適的飛行體驗，此外，長榮航空與法日潮流品牌Maison Kitsuné的跨界合作也在首航班上搶先登場，此次聯名合作推出全套過夜包、睡衣與拖鞋，展現時尚品味與功能性兼具，還新增可作為個人時尚配件的背帶設計，讓旅客延續旅程的愉悅體驗。


達拉斯作為美國德州的經濟與商業重心，不僅擁有強勁的經濟發展，更以其多元的文化與歷史吸引全球旅客，知名景點包含第六樓博物館、重逢塔及拓荒者廣場等，吸引旅客前來觀光旅遊，此外達拉斯更吸引多家台灣知名企業進駐，在當地進行業務拓展，項目涵蓋製造、科技、汽車等，達拉斯開航後，將可有效促進台美之間的商業交流與合作。


隨著達拉斯開航，長榮航空直飛北美擴增為9大客運航點，包含洛杉磯、舊金山、西雅圖、紐約、休士頓、芝加哥、溫哥華、多倫多以及達拉斯，從東岸到西岸，透過多樣化的航線選擇及綿密的航班服務，延伸至美加百餘個內陸城市，除了滿足不同客群需求，也讓旅客安排行程更加便利靈活。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[IT之家 10 月 3 日消息，导演詹姆斯・卡梅隆前天接受了电影媒体 Variety 采访，聊及他的最新作品《阿凡达：火与烬》，与主持人对谈电影理念、角色细节等。

卡梅隆表示：“我通常不会过度怀疑自己的创作冲动，但我承认自己不是个编剧天才，不过这部电影的时长至少会有 3 小时”。

同时卡梅隆还透露，原版《阿凡达》中的红色巨龙托鲁克将回归《阿凡达：火与烬》，他在《水之道》上映的时候一直在等观众发问：“为什么杰克不直接去找托鲁克，然后像以前一样干掉所有人？”。
不过最初的《阿凡达：火与烬》剧本中并没有托鲁克，卡梅隆说起了他的纠结历程：“原本我是想把托鲁克留到后面的电影才现身的，但我后来想到，杰克的命运就应该是去找托鲁克，他本就应该去追寻这只红色巨龙”。

所以卡梅隆后来重写了剧本，开机拍了两三场关于这只红色巨龙的镜头，并把一些不契合新剧情的镜头删掉，换成新的，于是片长就变成了 3 小时，但效果“非常震撼”，演员们看完后非常兴奋，他认为这种感觉非常好。

不过值得注意的是，《阿凡达：水之道》电影的时长就超过了 3 小时 12 分钟，但片长似乎不会对票房产生影响，毕竟《水之道》最终拿下 23.2 亿美元（IT之家注：现汇率约合 165.31 亿元人民币）票房（IMDb 数据）。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[IT之家 10 月 3 日消息，据中国信息通信研究院今日消息，经测算，2024 年我国人工智能产业规模已超 9000 亿元，同比增长 24%。
截至 2025 年 9 月，人工智能企业数量超 5300 家，全球占比达到 15%，形成覆盖基础底座、模型框架、行业应用的完整产业体系。
中国信通院副总工程师王爱华在 2025 人工智能产业及赋能新型工业化大会（IT之家注：9 月 23 日至 25 日）上说，从产业链看，人工智能产业分为基础层、模型框架层和应用层。2024 年，我国人工智能基础层收入同比增长 54%，规模达 3099 亿元；模型框架层收入同比增长 18%，规模达 315 亿元；应用层收入同比增长 13%，规模达 5665 亿元。以 AI 手机、AI 电脑、智能网联汽车等为代表的智能硬件增速较快。
会上，中国信通院发布了“2025 人工智能产业十大关键词”，即基础超级模型、自主性更强的智能体、走向实训的具身智能、萌芽中的世界模型、AI 正在重塑软件、开放智算生态、面向行业的高质量数据集、开源成为标配、缓解模型幻觉、人工智能国际公共产品。

中国信通院人工智能研究所所长魏凯认为，人工智能十大关键词是追踪行业发展的重要窗口，如“走向实训的具身智能”一词背后是具身智能正在加速走出实验室，走向竞技场和训练场，但从“实训”走向“干活”仍面临高质量数据缺、模型泛化难、软硬协同难等挑战。总体来看，2025 年人工智能技术、应用、生态三维共振，智能原生的新世界越来越清晰地展现在人们眼前。
此外，工业和信息化部人工智能标准化技术委员会介绍了成立以来在人工智能行业标准研制、生态建设、课题研究等方面取得的成果。目前已征集到 167 项人工智能标准立项建议，与中国通信标准化协会联合推动 20 项人工智能标准发布。]]></content>

麗臺科技（2465）銷售中國移動的專案訂單終於入袋，但因該公司交付95%款項後，遲遲沒有做驗收，並支付最後5%尾款，使得麗臺該筆訂單拖延一年多無法入袋，為此麗臺8月發律師函給對方確認推定驗收後，9月營收正式認列該筆大單2.79億人民幣，單月營收爆衝14.26億元創史上新高。


麗臺2024年搭上AI伺服器熱潮，中國子公司麗台上海信息科技參與中國移動通信集團專案，提供並建置200台NVIDIA HGX A800資料中心伺服器，總交易金額高達人民幣2.98億元，但雖大單出貨完畢，但因中國移動一直未驗收，麗臺就無法認列營收，而後美超微集團關係企業大訊、肯微入主麗臺科技，似乎因此找到解方。

根據麗臺公布，9月營收，已按照合約認列2024年度就收回95%應收帳款，這使麗臺9月營收爆衝至14.26億元歷史新高。


而拖延超過一年半，麗臺終於能認列營收原因是，中國移動已「視同」驗收麗臺交付200台AI伺服器。具相關知情人士指出，解套方法是照法律程序對中國移動「推定驗收」。


方式是麗臺上海於8月出具律師函給中國移動，信中說明：中國移動的最終客戶已經把麗台上海交付的伺服器產品，在2025年4月取用（下架並遷移至其他場所），因此可以認定中國移動雖然未按照合同約定進行最終驗收，但交付的產品已經被實際使用，因而產生「最終驗收」的法律效果。


透過此法律行動，麗臺除能將已收到的95%款項轉認列營收，也具備請求中國移動履行責任義務，支付剩餘5%應收帳款的權利。麗臺未來仍可能會針對5%尾款，相當於1,681萬人民幣採取法律行動催討。


據了解，中國移動系統建置案，總訂單金額人民幣2.98億元，其中第四及第五年需提供保固服務，該金額1,900萬人民幣，將需在第四及第五年才能認列，剩餘款項2.79億元人民幣則於9月認列。


麗臺9月雖認列中國移動2.79億人民幣龐大營收，但因提列信用損失及成本，該筆訂單9月並未貢獻獲利，粗估訂單單月帶來1,134.6萬元人民幣虧損，相當於新台幣4,844萬元損失，不過，知情人士透露，若把整個中國移動標案訂單（含第四第五年的保固收入）計算在內，該筆生意仍是獲利的。


至於麗臺9月中國移動標案加上本業的合計損益，以及第3季財報損益，則公司方面尚未公布。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[《施政報告》提出，進一步提升八間資助大專院校非本地生限額至五成，教育局局長蔡若蓮強調，不會影響本地生的資源。

教育局在去年調整八間資助大專院校非本地生限額，由原來兩成上調至四成，新一份《施政報告》再放寬至五成，以吸引更多學生來港發展。

在立法會教育事務委員會上，有議員關注會否分薄本地學生的資源。

新思維社會福利界議員狄志遠指出：「師生比例人數多了，當然有影響，圖書館使用或飯堂其他設備都會有影響，不知大學向政府反映會否學生多了，繼續能維持好的教育質素？」

教育局局長蔡若蓮表示：「我們留意到八大其實大幅增加了教學人員，尤其高級教學人員，升幅大概是一成五至一成六，分別增加數百人，增加招收非本地生同時，令我們吸引更多頂尖教授來港。」

工聯會勞工界議員梁子穎說：「還未計算碩士生、博士生來港留學時，究竟宿舍供應如何發展？除了非本地生，我們本地生宿舍都不足，政府這方面如何做好一些？」

蔡若蓮回應：「現在我們很早推出『城中學舍』，希望引入市場力量加快。我們見到新措施，市場反應很熱烈，我們估計供應速度及數量會快速增長。」

當局亦研究完善教師註冊機制，包括引入執業證書及定期更新要求等。

蔡若蓮稱：「定期更新執業證書，其實不同專業有不同年期，有些一年，有些三年，有些兩年，有些五年，所以我們會因應實際及配合教育周期訂定合理的期限。」

她強調，執業證書制度不會影響教師終身註冊制。]]></content>

南方人物周刊特约撰稿 陶短房
责任编辑：李屾淼
“我永远不原谅他们”
2025年9月24日，电影《哈利·波特》系列女主角的扮演者艾玛·沃特森出现在《杰伊·谢蒂播客》（On Purpose With Jay Shetty）。在谈及持续5年之久、她与《哈利·波特》系列小说作者J·K·罗琳之间围绕跨性别者问题的激烈争议时，沃特森罕见地作出了模棱两可的表态。她一方面继续强调“否定罗琳在跨性别问题上的立场”，另一方面却表示自己仍然爱罗琳，称“我一直为罗琳留有空间，我心里对她充满爱意，也希望她对我也有同样的感觉。但同时，我也与那些希望伤害她、憎恨她、希望她一生遭遇最糟糕境遇的人站在一起。尽管这两者看似互不相容，但却可以共存。这就是为什么我热爱我们生活的这个极其多元化的世界”。
她声称，自己“希望真的坐下来谈谈跨性别者的权利”。她还划清了界限：不同意罗琳的观点并不会抹去她们多年来在电影上合作的痕迹。
随后，罗琳谢绝一切采访，而是选择9月29日在自己的X平台账户发表长篇推文予以回应。她的措辞十分强硬、尖刻，并同时分享了支持她的喜剧演员IntelLady讽刺沃特森上述采访的恶搞视频。

在这个长篇回应中，罗琳把焦点放在了沃特森的名气和财富上。她认为，沃特森无法理解她所谓的“现实生活”中女性在收容所、医院或公共卫生间所面临的压力。罗琳将这段经历与《哈利·波特》热映前自己的贫困经历进行了对比，以此证明她更贴近日常生活。
罗琳称，自己“看到很多关于此事的评论，所以，我想提出几点”。她表示，“艾玛（沃特森）和丹（哈利·波特的扮演者丹尼尔·雷德克里夫）在过去几年里都明确表示，他们认为我们之前的职业协会赋予了他们特殊的权利——不，是义务——在公开场合批评我和我的观点。在他们结束《哈利·波特》的演出多年后，他们仍然扮演着我所创造的世界的代言人角色”，“我永远不会原谅他们，因为他们与一场意图侵蚀女性来之不易的权利的运动沆瀣一气。”
罗琳表示，她对沃特森的愤怒并非源于这位女演员对她此前言论的谴责，而是源于2022年英国电影学院奖颁奖典礼上的一次事件。当时沃特森宣称：“我是为了所有女巫而来的。”然后，她无声地补了一句：“除了某人。”罗琳将这番话当成了针对她个人的。她声称，尽管这位女演员有她的电话号码，但沃特森还是在事件发生后指派了其他人给自己送了

The opportunity is there, but the Party’s establishment would have to confront the issue that has prompted more recent censorship than any other.
By Jay Caspian Kang
October 3, 2025








Illustration by Till Lauer






This is my first column since going on book leave in May. (Thank you to Jon Allsop for filling in admirably and expanding the mission of Fault Lines while he was at it.) Every restart comes with a bit of looking back, and, this week, I want to revisit a series of columns from the past few years which concern the First Amendment. I am a free-speech absolutist—an admittedly mostly useless and conditional term that tends to fall apart at the gentlest touch. What it means, in my case, is that I believe that all forms of nonviolent speech should be protected; that the government should not have any power to regulate media outlets, individual speakers, or online platforms; and that, on a broader, nonlegal, and even spiritual level, people should regard any type of censorship, even when done by private actors operating within their rights, with skepticism and worry. I’m convinced that most Americans agree with this view, at least in theory, and one of the arguments that I’ve made during the past few years is that the Democratic Party and people on the left should return to their historical position as the defenders of the First Amendment, not only because it’s the right thing to do—and utterly essential in a moment when the Trump Administration seems to be gearing up for a crackdown on dissent in the government, the media, and the academy—but also because it’s one of those things, like football and underdog stories, that fill Americans with warm, familiar feelings.
Needless to say, this writing campaign has been almost entirely in vain. The liberal side of American politics has, in the past few decades, essentially ceded the cause of free speech to the right. Pick any losing battle you want: the debate about trigger warnings and safe spaces, which became popular on college campuses and elsewhere in the early twenty-tens; or the fights over deplatforming allegedly harmful speakers about ten years ago; or the shutting down of “disinformation” on social media during the early Biden Administration. These little acts of censorship had the net effect of helping people on the right make the case that they were and are having their speech suppressed. The rise of Charlie Kirk’s Turning Point USA, for example, depended on his correct assessment that there were conservative students on every campus who felt like they couldn’t speak their minds in class without facing social consequences. He also understood that the emotional unrest among these kids could be harnessed with just a little prodding and organizing.




Can liberals do something similar now? Free speech, for obvious reasons, has always been an opposition-party issue—it’s a lot harder to claim that the government is suppressing you when your preferred party is in power. Two weeks ago, Democratic Representative Jason Crow, of Colorado, talked about the No Political Enemies Act, which, in its own words, reaffirms “the constitutionally protected right to free speech and establishes clear and enforceable protections to deter abuse, empower individuals and organizations to defend themselves, and create meaningful accountability.” The bill is known by the rather unfortunate acronym NOPE. In practice, NOPE would “prohibit the use of federal funds for any investigations or regulatory action that would suppress protected speech” and provide “tools” for people who find themselves on the wrong side of censors. A companion measure was introduced in the Senate, by Chris Murphy, of Connecticut, and Chris Van Hollen, of Maryland, with support from the Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer. The chances that the Republican-controlled House or the Republican-controlled Senate bring the bill to the floor are basically zero. Still, NOPE allowed Democrats, in the wake of Jimmy Kimmel’s brief suspension from the air, to do a little First Amendment sabre-rattling and to show that they, too, care about free speech.


Will it work? If you believe that politics obeys a kind of thermodynamics, it would stand to reason that the Democrats, now expressing growing concerns over censorship—especially with this past week’s unveiling of National Security Presidential Memorandum 7, which would effectively classify many speech acts as domestic terrorism—would be able to seize the mantle of free speech and build up a degree of activist energy, particularly at colleges and universities, where cuts to federal funding and threats from the Trump Administration have led to the dissolution of entire fields of study.

But I don’t think this will happen. For one thing, the cultural shift that led to safe spaces and trigger warnings was more powerful than some of us may want to admit. It’s true that we are in the waning days of the concept that speech is violence—due in part to a marked algorithmic shift in social media, from peak woke to peak reactionary, as well as the plummeting faith the public has in the academy, the crucible for this idea. But people who had adopted that position and supported what was broadly labelled “cancel culture” still occupy roles in the infrastructure of the Democratic Party, of major nonprofits, and of academia. It’s hard to imagine that the individuals who mostly rolled their eyes at free-speech claims just a few years ago will suddenly transform into Mario Savio-style culture warriors, urging their audiences to throw themselves onto the gears of government. These same people, for better or worse, are the gears. Crow, Van Hollen, and Murphy should be applauded for introducing NOPE and at least trying to reclaim free speech, but I suspect even they know that their party currently has little standing on the issue.





The reasons for that lack of credibility extend well beyond the campus speech wars of the past few decades. For all its appeal as an abstract idea, free speech, as a cause, tends to require an emotional issue that is actually prompting censorship before it can unite people from different political tribes to rally under its banner. For the past two years, the subject that has done this more than any other has been the war in Gaza. Many Americans have been fired or had their free-speech rights violated because of their statements about the war—and this has created a tremendous insurrectionary energy on both the far right and the left. Nearly every poll taken during the past six months has shown that a significant majority of Democrats believe that the United States should stop providing economic and military support for Israel. A Democratic Party that was both in line with its constituency and committed to free speech would have protected pro-Palestinian speakers and loudly stood up to the Trump Administration’s efforts to defund Middle Eastern-studies departments at universities and to detain and deport activists. Some of the Administration’s actions, most notably the detention of the Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil, did garner a response from Democrats, but the noise came largely from the Party’s left—Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley—rather than from its establishment.
The Party can’t talk convincingly about free speech and the First Amendment while avoiding the issue that has prompted a wave of censorship and which, meanwhile, dominates social media, becoming the main focus of the political commentariat on every video platform, whether Twitch, YouTube, or TikTok. This doesn’t mean that every Democrat needs to abandon their support for Israel, but, rather, that they should do what generations of free-speech advocates have done and defend the speech rights of people they disagree with. But the Democratic Party seems to prefer a selective vision of free speech, one that ignores the most glaring and visible current example of suppression. In Jason Crow’s fourteen-minute address to Congress introducing NOPE, he talked about senators and members of congress being handcuffed and arrested, generals being fired, journalists being attacked, and ICE agents “interrogating kids on a baseball diamond in Harlem.” All these are real examples that testify to the importance of the First Amendment. But nowhere in his speech, which was mostly a litany of Donald Trump’s threats to democracy, did Crow mention the squashing and policing of dissent regarding this country’s continued support for the war in Gaza, which a significant majority of the Democratic Party’s constituents believe should end.
Will these two problems—the Party’s censorious infrastructure and its general unwillingness to talk about Gaza—doom any Democratic free-speech campaigns? One can make the case that many voters are also willing to be selective in their vision—the right’s defense of free speech gathered steam despite the Republican Party suffering from even more seemingly intractable internal contradictions on the issue. And the social-media outcry over Kimmel’s indefinite suspension and subsequent reinstatement might suggest that a new civil-liberties movement is gaining momentum. But recent history has shown that such flareups, especially those that largely take place online, tend to die down quickly. What’s left are the actual people in the actual offices of actual elected officials who set the agenda for the Party. And, even though I would warmly welcome a free-speech movement from precisely those people, I find it almost impossible to believe that any of them could sell it to the public. ♦]]></content>

In Luca Guadagnino’s film, Julia Roberts plays a Yale professor forced to choose sides when a student accuses a colleague of sexual assault.









Roberts’s magnetism comes from the way she withdraws into a cocoon of inscrutability as her character, Alma, faces an increasingly fraught dilemma. It isn’t until Alma acts that you grasp all that she’s been quietly weighing.Illustration by Raj Dhunna







If there is a truth that holds firm beneath the wickedly slippery surfaces of Luca Guadagnino’s movies, it’s that presentation counts. No sartorial decision is made lightly, and no design element is arrived at by accident. The opening titles of his new drama, “After the Hunt,” should have you on high alert. They’re elegantly rendered in what looks to be Windsor Light Condensed, widely recognizable as Woody Allen’s onscreen typeface of choice. A Thad Jones jazz standard on the soundtrack more or less confirms that we’re watching a borderline trollish act of homage. Are we about to enter an enclave of attractive, privileged, hopelessly self-involved intellectuals, as in so many Allen movies? Or will Guadagnino’s art imitate Allen’s life, with a tale of grim allegations, firm denials, and he-said-she-said dialectics?
Yes, to all of the above. “After the Hunt” revolves around Alma Imhoff, a professor in the philosophy department at Yale, where the talk is neither light nor condensed. She is played by Julia Roberts, who, you may recall, was a nineteen-fifties art-history instructor in “Mona Lisa Smile” (2003), pushing conservative-minded Wellesley women toward self-realization. Alma, a creature of our times, offers a pricklier kind of feminist inspiration: she’s formidable, aloof, feared, and adored. I counted one unguarded outburst of laughter, when Alma, unwinding over drinks with a colleague, lets out the signature full-throated Roberts cackle, but it felt like a boozy anomaly—a stray glimmer of warmth from a woman who knows that scholarly authority is best served cold. Striding into a classroom, she has only to utter the words “Foucault’s panopticon” to reduce us all to teacher’s pets, eagerly leaning forward in our seats.




At a dinner party she hosts with her psychoanalyst husband, Frederik (Michael Stuhlbarg), Alma is no less in her element. Resplendent in Veronica Lake curls, and softly lighted against handsome wood panelling, she draws the attention of everyone in sight. The flirty blowhard with the goatee is a younger philosophy professor, Hank (Andrew Garfield), who signals their years of friendship (and maybe more) by propping his legs up against her on the couch. Seated nearby is Maggie (Ayo Edebiri), a doctoral candidate rumored to be brilliant, though all we can discern, watching her fidget, is an anxious yearning for Alma’s approval (and maybe more). The party chatter is thick with high-flown intellectualism, cross-generational sniping, and intra-department rivalry, none of which anyone could or should mistake for plausible academia-speak. The screenwriter, Nora Garrett, has achieved an amusingly florid Hollywood simulacrum—one that tilts into knowing parody—of an intensely self-regarding world. The more irritating the characters get, the more compelling the movie becomes.


It’s the fall of 2019, with #MeToo still ascendant and the rollback of D.E.I. and other reactionary assaults on social justice still far in the future. But “After the Hunt” doesn’t feel dated; as its title implies, it’s a period piece and it knows it. (An epilogue set in early 2025 makes this pointedly and poignantly clear.) The effect is to infuse the story with an undeniable and knowing nostalgia; how quaint, at Alma’s party, to find everyone debating matters of representational consequence. Will Alma earn tenure before Hank, a guest noxiously suggests, simply because she isn’t a straight, white, cisgender male? How will the progressive winds of the present affect the teaching of Nietzsche, Heidegger, Freud, and other problematic geniuses of the past?
Beneath such rhetorical feints, Garrett sets an intricate trap for characters and viewers alike. Alma returns home one evening to find Maggie waiting outside with a look of wild anguish and a terrible experience to recount. After the party, she says, Hank walked her back to her apartment, came up for a nightcap, and, against her protests, drunkenly assaulted her. “He crossed the line,” Maggie insists, and something in her phrasing sounds a warning bell, as if she were describing not the trauma of a sexual violation but a meticulously recorded breach of moral protocol. Edebiri, wide-eyed and almost wraithlike, seems to have been directed to act as if she were lying—and lying badly. Maggie asks for Alma’s support, but what we hear sounds less like a cry for help than like a test of loyalty. Alma, responding with more questions than sympathy, fails it utterly.
Have we in the audience also failed Maggie if we find her unpersuasive? Well, no: she’s a fictional character, and, as Alma peevishly points out during a seminar, fictional characters don’t need to be coddled; they’re there to be scrutinized, analyzed, and, if need be, torn down. Guadagnino encourages our doubts, shooting Maggie in exaggerated horror-movie closeups set to the doomy bass notes and shrieking winds of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross’s score. The idea of Maggie’s untrustworthiness has already been planted in an early scene, mid-party, involving a bathroom cabinet and a hidden envelope conveniently filled with old news clippings concerning dark secrets in Alma’s past. Maggie is a snoop—and a clumsy one. (She rifles through the clippings at such length that I assumed she was scanning for coupons.) She’s also emblematic of a story in which nothing and no one can be trusted.

Nearly every frame of “After the Hunt” spins a glossy lie, and not just because the film, though set in New Haven, was shot in London. It’s a posh Ivy League whodunnit and a cinematic Rorschach blot, cleverly rigged to generate cascading waves of suspicion. Hank, desperate for Alma’s ear, claims that he had confronted Maggie with evidence of plagiarism on her part, and that her rape accusation is purely retaliatory. But what of the toxicity, the ill-disguised capacity for sexual aggression, lurking beneath his oily charm? None of it helps his case, though it does broaden Garfield’s range. As an actor whose most famous roles include a conscientious objector, a Jesuit priest, and Spider-Man, he seems liberated to be playing the part of an out-and-out sleaze.





And Alma? She may be the shadiest of the lot, and part of her magnetism comes from the way she withdraws into a cocoon of inscrutability as her dilemma becomes more fraught. Roberts, her face a mask, hints at the character’s internal calculations more than she dramatizes them. It isn’t until Alma acts that you fully grasp all that she’s been quietly weighing: the consequences of withholding support from Maggie, a queer Black woman whose parents are major donors to the university, but also the possibility of losing Hank, a longtime friend who also happens to be a professional rival. And then there is the guilty past alluded to in those clippings, the memory of which frequently strikes her down with debilitating pain and nausea. Roberts isn’t the kind of actress you often see retching into a toilet, and the sight and sounds are genuinely upsetting, as if Alma’s very guts were cancelling her from within. The only character who seems entirely transparent is Frederik, who can’t hide his resentment of his second-class spousal status or his contempt for the sycophants and mediocrities who cling to his wife like barnacles. The role is not kind to Stuhlbarg, but here, as in Guadagnino’s “Call Me by Your Name” (2017), he is well cast as a perceptive truthteller on the margins, and he rises to the occasion with the puckish wit of a cuckolded diva.
What would be Frederik’s witheringly honest assessment of this movie? He might find that “After the Hunt,” ostensibly a juicy conversation starter, has little to say about the matters it raises—not race, not gender, not queerness, not diversity, not cancel culture, not sexual assault, and certainly not philosophy. I mean this almost as a compliment; Garrett knows how to deploy verbiage as misdirection. At times, you may sense the film revealing its cards, as when a campus therapist (a supremely dry Chloë Sevigny) calls out the privilege, entitlement, and relentless self-victimization of Yale’s students: “These kids,” she scoffs, “have had everything handed to them their whole lives.” But Guadagnino, alive to the pleasure of every line reading, maintains a pretty good poker face. The conventions and gestures of a topical potboiler—reflexive eye rolls, snap-worthy tell-offs—clearly excite him. He’s drawn to this material not by the weight of its ethical conundrums but by the chance to watch beautiful people attempt, or pretend, to hash those conundrums out.
“After the Hunt” will be derided as little more than an intellectual parlor trick, a flimsy house of cards. I wouldn’t disagree, but few directors build more luxurious houses than Guadagnino does, whatever the materials. The most telling line comes from a peripheral character, the dean of the philosophy department, who laments the increasingly shallow and politicized nature of his position: “Against all odds, I’ve found myself in the business of optics, not substance.” Guadagnino draws no such distinction. For him, style is substance, and optics are just variations on style. No wonder Roberts’s performance reaches a peak of intensity, and tugs most irresistibly at our sympathies, when Alma’s rage finally spills out into the open, in a full-bore character-assassination rant that’s as commanding as it is ill-advised. It’s not, as they say, a good look. It’s a great one. ♦]]></content>

In the face of threats and harassment, some trans Americans are becoming gun owners—only to be targeted by the same movements that claim to defend gun rights.

Last month, in the wake of a mass shooting in Minneapolis that investigators say was carried out by a transgender woman, the Department of Justice began looking into ways to strip trans Americans of the right to bear arms. One senior Justice Department official told CNN that the goal is “to ensure that mentally ill individuals suffering from gender dysphoria are unable to obtain firearms while they are unstable and unwell.” (It should be noted that mental illness alone does not currently disqualify someone from owning a gun; federal law stipulates that only those who have been involuntarily committed to a psychiatric institution, or who have been declared mentally incompetent by a legal authority, can be prohibited from gun ownership.) Upon hearing the news about the internal D.O.J. discussions, the National Rifle Association issued a statement declaring its opposition to limiting the Second Amendment rights of any law-abiding citizen—though the N.R.A. did not explicitly name trans people. For even the most full-throated gun advocates, trans people are often the awkward exception: about a month before he was killed, Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist, called for a ban on trans gun ownership. “If you are crazy enough to want to hormonally and surgically ‘change your sex,’ ” he posted on X, “you have a mental disorder, and you are too crazy to own a firearm.”

The Lede
Reporting and commentary on what you need to know today.

As the culture wars erupt into violent extremism, “gender ideology”—which the Trump Administration defines as “the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one’s sex”—has gone from being seen as “woke” to being framed by members of the political right as one of the sources of America’s evils, including its violence. Most violence, political or otherwise, is not perpetrated by trans people. In fact, trans people are four times more likely than cisgender people to be victims of violent crime. Yet right-wing commentators have fixated on two incidents involving shooters who were described by authorities as trans—a mass shooting at the Covenant School, in Nashville, in 2023, and the more recent shooting at Annunciation Catholic School, in Minneapolis—as evidence of “trans terrorism,” in the words of the Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh. The Heritage Foundation, the right-wing think tank responsible for Project 2025, recently issued a call for the F.B.I. to designate “Transgender Ideology-Inspired Violent Extremism” as a domestic terror threat. In both the case of the Nashville shooting and the Minneapolis attack, authorities have not shared any evidence indicating that the shooters’ respective gender identities drove their horrific actions. There was widespread speculation that the shooter at the Covenant School, who had previously been a student there, was motivated by anti-religious resentment. But an investigation conducted by the Metro Nashville Police Department concluded that the shooter, who had enjoyed their time at the school, had been motivated by fame.




Almost immediately after Charlie Kirk was killed in Utah, three weeks ago, conservative figures began speculating that the shooter was either trans or had murdered Kirk because of his anti-trans rhetoric. (Kirk was talking about trans mass shooters just before he was shot.) Republicans quickly consolidated Democrats, Antifa, and trans people into one radical enemy. “I mean, give me a fucking break,” the congresswoman Nancy Mace said on Capitol Hill. “This guy’s talking about mass trans violence, tranny violence—I’m not going to filter myself—and got shot in the neck like that.” The day after Kirk’s death, the Wall Street Journal reported that the ammunition used in the shooting had been engraved with expressions of transgender “ideology”—a claim that was refuted by Utah’s governor, Spencer Cox, and that the Journal later walked back. First, conservatives said the shooter was trans; then they said the bullets were trans. Now they’ve seized on reports that Tyler Robinson, the suspect in custody, had a trans partner or roommate. As always, their aims are a moving target, with a common enemy.
The issue of minority gun ownership has long been fraught. In 1857, Chief Justice Roger Taney argued in Dred Scott v. Sandford that Black people should not be recognized as citizens because it would give them the right “to keep and carry arms wherever they want.” Even after Black people became citizens entitled to Second Amendment rights, they often had to deal with discriminatory gun laws limiting their access to firearms. Despite his house being firebombed in 1956, Martin Luther King, Jr., was unable to obtain a concealed-carry permit. Because of this, guns would ultimately become a key component of the Black Power movement. Activists carried guns for community patrols, self-defense, and as a show of force. In May, 1967, the Black Panthers entered the California Capitol Building with shotguns, pistols, and rifles to protest stricter gun-control laws. In recent years, Black and L.G.B.T.Q. gun ownership has been on the rise, with individuals in both groups citing the marked increase in hate crimes as a primary motivator for arming themselves in self-defense.
Many trans gun owners I spoke with were anxious about the Administration potentially limiting their access to firearms. “The trans people I know, both gun owners and others, see the prospect of the D.O.J. taking trans people’s guns as a prelude to atrocity,” Eden Fenn, a young trans woman, told me. She called herself “the definition of a reluctant gun owner,” describing her ownership as a precautionary measure against the potential of anti-trans violence. Similarly, Margaret Killjoy, a trans musician and writer, told me that she obtained a gun permit after being doxed by far-right extremists.

I’m not a gun owner, but I understand the instinct: after the shooting at Pulse night club, in 2016, it occurred to me that I might want to learn how to use a gun for my own protection. It took me several years to overcome my squeamishness, and I finally went to a gun range for the first time this past summer. Aside from the employees staffing the front desk, I was the only woman there. My instructor told me to be careful of gunshot residue, since I was showing slightly more skin than the men in camouflage and hockey jerseys next to me. Over all, it was a surprisingly mundane outing. I fired a few rounds and then I left.





Both Killjoy and Fenn said that visiting gun ranges has become an increasingly charged experience for them. (“I’ve gotten a lot of weird looks but no outright hostility so far,” Fenn told me.) Killjoy said that she was heartened by the N.R.A. expressing support for everyone maintaining the ability to own guns, even if she doesn’t endorse the more right-wing aspects of the organization’s agenda. She sees guns as a “tiny part” of community organizing and safety, alongside mutual-aid groups and fund-raisers. Killjoy, who lives in rural Appalachia, said that most of the people she knows who are anti-gun live in cities or in the suburbs. “In the country, a gun is a fundamentally different symbol,” she said, “a symbol of self-reliance.” She said that she hopes we can change what gun culture looks like in the U.S.; the focus should be less on sensationalism and more on gun safety and community preparedness. “I believe that changing what gun culture looks like is the more useful way to make gun ownership a less dangerous thing, and a thing where it’s less stigmatized and less associated with the right wing,” she told me.


The debate over trans gun ownership is especially complicated in the context of the larger push by progressives for widespread gun control. Even someone who is steadfast in their support of trans rights might find it hard to advocate for trans gun ownership if they believe in limiting access to guns more broadly. But as R.K., a trans gun owner in Philadelphia, said of the D.O.J.’s conversations, “It’s not about gun control. It’s about removing trans people’s autonomy.” It is impossible to separate this action from the Administration’s larger assault on trans rights and trans health care. R.K. noted that their friends have seen an increase in street harassment since around the time of the Presidential election last year. “The reason I own a gun is not because of a moral standpoint, but because of a simple necessity,” they said. “I’m just responding to the conditions I see in front of me.” Given that Trump has mobilized the military in cities like Chicago and Washington, D.C., and used agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to crack down on activists, R.K. is worried about the Administration going after trans people in a similar manner. “I think the way ICE has been disappearing people is really scary,” they said. “These are people in my community, in real life. I worry about that turning toward us and accelerating so fast.”
For other members of the trans community, owning a gun is not only a source of protection but a form of gender affirmation. One young trans man told me that he grew up in a liberal household in Pennsylvania, where his parents were vehemently anti-gun. After a terrifying series of attempted break-ins, though, he decided to buy his first firearm. Eventually, he moved to a new city, in Texas, and transitioned. There, he said, “having a gun made me feel more like a man than I realized it would. It is something so ingrained in Texas culture that it helped me to hide in plain sight.” From the start, he has been adamant about gun safety; when he first thought of learning how to shoot, his neighbor taught him how to clear jams and clean his weapon, as well as techniques for proper maintenance. He compared guns to cars, framing them as everyday tools that pose risks: “If the person driving the car is not being a responsible driver, people can and will get hurt.” (Ninety-two per cent of households own a car, and about half have a gun, but the number of deaths from cars and guns annually is roughly the same.)
Of course, gun safety is not only an issue of physical protection; mental health plays a role, too. Mental health is often weaponized against the trans community, with politicians such as Ronny Jackson, the congressman from Texas who once served as Trump’s Presidential physician, calling for the mass institutionalization of trans people, characterizing anyone who changes their sex as mentally ill. Despite these bad-faith attacks, there are legitimate concerns about the high rates of depression and suicidal ideation among trans people, which many of the trans gun owners I spoke with acknowledged. They expressed a desire to have a more candid conversation about maintaining emotional-wellness plans in order to responsibly possess firearms. Everyone I spoke with talked about their gun-safety plans. Some suggested that it should be normalized to offload your guns to a friend while going through a traumatic experience. All gun owners must balance the possible danger that their guns may bring to themselves and to others, whether they’re trans or cis, and whether or not they’re prone to depression. There are no easy answers—only a delicate calculus to be made. To those who are wary of trans gun ownership, R.K. offered a simple admonishment: build better material conditions for trans people, a world where they can feel safe without arming themselves. “I just need to see people step up and not pretend like it’s a problem that’s not happening.” ♦]]></content>

“When Objects Dream,” the sensational Man Ray show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Feb. 1), is centered on the artist’s refined experiments with the cameraless images he called rayographs: the shadowy impressions left on photographic paper by scattered objects after the paper has been exposed to light. It should come as no surprise that his first experiments in the form, published, in 1922, as a suite of twelve abstract images, are among his most accomplished. Ray had already channelled the antic, subversive spirit of Dada and Surrealism with a series of readymade sculptures that included a flatiron studded with a row of tacks. But, like Marcel Duchamp, Ray was a movement unto himself. No matter the medium—painting, sculpture, film, photography—he reimagined it with a focussed intelligence and a deadpan wit that still looks definitively avant-garde.

At the Met, the curators Stephanie D’Alessandro and Stephen C. Pinson set up a lively dialogue across mediums, which shows how all of Ray’s work from the nineteen-twenties and onward was intimately connected to his experiments in photography. Their installation opens up like a series of magic boxes, with windows that draw visitors deep into the exhibition, across time and space. As promised, many of the most astonishing images are photograms that, even when we can make out their ordinary components—a magnet, a pipe, a key, a handgun—glow like visions from another consciousness. And they always illuminate a painting or a sculpture nearby. Ray’s “Lampshade” (1921), a curl of painted tin suspended from a thin metal pole, anticipates the elegance and simplicity of many rayographs that followed. A group of solarized photographs, including some of Ray’s most famous portraits and nudes, capture the soft, silvery quality of many of the rayographs in a more concentrated form.




Ray’s most chaotic photograms—jumbles that push out of the frame or look like time bombs ready to explode—find echoes in his films, projected on the back walls, a show in themselves. Nervous, comic, plotless, and mesmerizing, his experimental shorts are classic underground cinema. Their restless energy doesn’t exactly tie everything together, but they help highlight the spirit of inventiveness that electrifies the exhibition as a whole.—Vince Aletti







About Town

Broadway
In James Graham’s “PUNCH,” based on Jacob Dunne’s memoir “Right from Wrong,” Jacob (an impressive Will Harrison) is an aggressive lad from Nottingham, who kills a man at a bar with a single punch. A restorative-justice initiative links Jacob to the victim’s parents, whose interest in him manages to counter the forces drawing him back toward violence. Graham’s play, imported from the U.K. by Manhattan Theatre Club, is essentially a public-service announcement for the program that helped Dunne, its facts enlivened by the director Adam Penford’s peripatetic choreography. Dunne’s individual story has value, poignancy, and warmth, but the play’s wider implication—that class paralysis can only be disrupted by tragedy—chills the blood.—Helen Shaw (Samuel J. Friedman; through Nov. 2.)

Alt-Pop
The producer and guitarist Nate Amos and the singer Rachel Brown, the duo behind the indie band Water from Your Eyes, were once a couple; ironically, they only locked in after they broke up. The pair started in Chicago, releasing four albums amid a move to Brooklyn, but they truly discovered their balance on the 2021 LP “Structure,” which Brown credits with helping them become friends again. Since signing to Matador, the band has sharpened its sound into a quirky, exhilarated alt-pop, too uncanny to be dance-punk and too lively to be slacker rock. “Everyone’s Crushed,” from 2023, brought all of the band’s previous exploits into alignment with a nihilistic sense of humor, while the latest Water from Your Eyes album, “It’s a Beautiful Place,” is beefier and harder to pin down, as the duo search for optimism amid absurdity.—Sheldon Pearce (Bowery Ballroom; Oct. 10.)

Art




“Community Service,” 2024.Art work by Parmen Daushvili / Courtesy the artist / Polina Berlin Gallery; Photograph by Steven Probert






Entering the London-based painter Parmen Daushvili’s world of beautiful muted colors, with its aquamarine blues and greens, is rather like entering a pool filled with eucalyptus-infused water—cool, refreshing, and transformative to both body and spirit. While the figures in some of the larger canvases are reminiscent of Lucian Freud’s twisting and turning sitters, Daushvili’s strongest work is not monumental but small and intimate. The outstanding “Community Service” (2024) is populated by a single person who seems to move toward us even while standing still under the scrim of the painter’s beautiful sense of color and his poetic, and ultimately gentle, sensibility.—Hilton Als (Polina Berlin; through Oct. 11.)

Off Broadway
The vanishing, last year, of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Phantom of the Opera” from Broadway (cape whooshes mysteriously) makes way for its not-quite-replacement, “Masquerade,” an immersive version directed by Diane Paulus. Theatregoers, dressed in cocktail attire, pursue—but do not apprehend!—the famously masked monster and his soprano abductee, chasing them from the vaulted basement of a midtown building to its roof. Even diligent Webberheads will need to overlook certain gaffes, like a hero who seems to have tied himself up in a climactic moment and a Stygian lair well marked with glowing Exit signs. The excitement of extraordinary voices singing close by fades, too, due to the necessity of canned accompaniment—it’s somehow not that scary to be stalked by a phantom of the karaoke.—H.S. (218 W. 57th St.; through Feb. 1.)

Dance

For its first visit to New York since 2012, the Paris Opera Ballet isn’t bringing any of the classical works for which it is known, but instead a new piece by the brand-name Israeli-born contemporary choreographer Hofesh Shechter. His “Red Carpet” does supply some expected Parisian glamour: red velvet curtains, costumes by Chanel, a giant chandelier as in “The Phantom of the Opera.” But the mode is his usual earthy dream, with live music that suggests rock concerts and dance clubs, clumps of bodies that sink and slink as arms float overhead, and shifting lines and circles out of some feral folk dance.—Brian Seibert (City Center; Oct. 9-12.)

Movies
Dwayne (the Rock) Johnson, a longtime star professional wrestler, brings wit and insight to his leading role in “The Smashing Machine,” a bio-pic about the mixed-martial-arts fighter Mark Kerr. The writer and director, Benny Safdie, presents the story from 1997, when Kerr had his first triumphs, to 2000, when personal problems caught up with him. Safdie perceptively locates the protagonist’s troubling inner contradictions—the atavistic fury that drives him to compete and the intense self-control that competition demands—but dramatizes such outer crises as opioid addiction and conflict with his girlfriend (Emily Blunt) only schematically. The director’s approach is coolly distant and underpowered; even scenes of bloody battle in the ring feel merely informational. Nonetheless, Johnson’s performance is eerily introverted and tautly disciplined; his presence is commanding from start to finish.—Richard Brody (In wide release.)





Bar Tab

Dan Stahl finds I.P.A.s, arcade games, and portals in FiDi.




Illustration by Patricia Bolaños






If you play it right, a visit to the new, FiDi outpost of Barcade—the hybrid arcade and craft-beer bar that originated in Williamsburg twenty-one years ago—leads to a quasi-inter-dimensional portal. Your first move, after entering, is to advance to the stone countertop on your left. Survey the chalkboard menu, rich in I.P.A.s, and choose according to your mettle. If that means the Evil Twin Pink Pineapple, prepare for a goblet of roseate brew whose tartness zaps the mouth like a laser. Explore your surroundings. Some may look familiar: pinball machines, Ms. Pac-Man, Street Fighter. Others may seem foreign, literally, such as 超・ちゃぶ台返し!, a Japanese game whose name signifies “extreme table flipping!” A knowledge of the language will aid you, as the instructions are in kanji. “At the wedding . . . something’s happened,” a player recently endeavored to translate. He commenced pounding a small table attached to the machine, then victoriously upended it. Onscreen, a bridezilla sent an equivalent table soaring through a banquet hall, felling at least one chandelier. Venture to the far corner of the bar, where a staircase descends to a subterranean wood-panelled lair; perhaps the greatest arcade game of all time, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles; and the aforementioned portal. Amid the blinking screens and battered tabletops, with a synth-heavy eighties anthem mingling with ambient beeps and boops, you may feel yourself transported four decades back—or, if you’ve imbibed liberally, into another reality altogether, one in which you are somehow a character in the universe of games surrounding you. But this state is fleeting, especially during family hours on Sunday, when a parental call to arms can instantly return you to the real world: “Hey, Susan—I have to change Reesie’s diaper!”

A New Yorker Quiz

It’s finally feeling like fall. Can you guess who wrote these autumnal works?

A poem, from earlier this year, which opens with the lines, “Black walnuts hitting a barn roof / Fairly rapped the morning.”

A poem, from 2017, which includes a stanza that reads, “Fall was approaching. / But I remember / it was always approaching / once school ended.”
A story, written around 1961, which begins “November. Cold outside. It was warm inside, and the big combination played twelve wonderful records without stopping.”

P.S. Good stuff on the internet:

A Thai hitman who killed a Cambodian opposition politician in Bangkok was sentenced to life in prison on Friday for murder.
Lim Kimya, a former opposition parliamentarian in Cambodia, was shot dead in the old quarter of Bangkok hours on January 7.
Kimya was shot in the chest shortly after arriving in the Thai capital on a bus from neighboring Cambodia. His French wife was also there, and witnessed the murder of her husband. 
The Thai defendant, who was arrested in Cambodia the day after the shooting, had faced a potential death sentence for the premeditated murder but his sentence was commuted to life as he confessed.
Who was Lim Kimya?
Kimya, 74, was a dual Cambodian and French citizen and a member of the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) from 2013 to 2017.
The CNRP was the country's main opposition movement and was dissolved by Cambodia's Supreme Court ahead of the 2018 general election because of an alleged treason plot, which the CNRP dismissed at the time as a fabrication.
Two Cambodian suspects remain uncaught
Two further men are still being sought for the murder, with both said to be Cambodian nationals. One is thought to have hired the hitman while the other was said to be a lookout who allegedly was on the bus alongside the victim and his wife.
One of the accused was an aide to former ruling party leader Hun Sen, leading to Cambodia's ruling party releasing a statement saying that the suspect was dismissed from the role in March 2024.
Hun Sen led Cambodia for nearly four decades until 2023. Numerous Western nations and human rights organizations have long accused his government of using the legal system to crush the opposition.

Cambodia-Thailand truce remains shaky

Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered a speech at the plenary session of the 22nd Valdai Discussion Club meeting, touching upon a range of pressing global issues.


Russia continues to advance all along the frontline, which shatters Donald Trump’s “paper tiger” claims, ex-CIA agent Larry Johnson told Sputnik.

Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasized that the Russian Army continues its offensive and is inflicting heavy casualties on Ukrainian troops. “If we are fighting with the entire NATO bloc, we are moving, advancing, and we feel confident, and we are a ‘paper tiger,’ then what is NATO itself?” the Russian president underscored.

Earlier, US President Donald Trump wrote that he believes Russia is fighting in Ukraine aimlessly and described Russia as a "paper tiger." He later stated that he does not intend to use the term "paper tiger" going forward.

Johnson said that during the speech, Putin “continued to emphasize trying to resolve things [regarding the Ukraine conflict] through negotiations.”


“He did draw a distinction between the United States and Europe, noting that Europe is far more bellicose and threatening. But that Russia would prefer to, again, engage in dialogue as opposed to fighting, but will fight, if necessary,” the analyst emphasized.






The speech was Putin’s message for the Global South and Russia's partners “so they could see that he's not panicked, he’s not evidencing any kind of fear, and he continues to present himself with a very deliberative logic,” according to the ex-CIA intelligence officer.


The Russian president called multipolarity “a direct consequence of attempts to establish and preserve global hegemony,” adding that “the world is undergoing “rapid and drastic changes.”






Putin dismissed allegations that Russia plans to attack the EU or NATO, underlining that politicians who promote this are either “grossly incompetent” or “crooked” and lying to their citizens. He also underscored that mending relations with the US remains one of Russia’s national interests.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[IT之家 10 月 3 日消息，爆料人 Roland Quandt 今天在 Bluesky 平台透露了三星 Galaxy S26 系列手机的前置摄像头参数。

Roland Quandt 表示，Galaxy S26 手机将全系标配 1200 万像素前置摄像头，支持自动对焦，不过他并没有透露前置摄像头是否会有光圈、传感器尺寸方面的升级。
后续有用户在评论区询问博主：“你是否知道三星还计划推出 S26 Plus 吗？”，博主回复道：“目前我只知道 S26 系列有三个型号”。
科技媒体 Android Authority 对此表示，三星从 Galaxy S23 起就一直使用 1200 万像素 f/2.2 光圈的前置摄像头，并且三星在前摄方面的技术升级不算积极，对比之下苹果的 iPhone 17 系列手机全系标配了方形 CMOS，可让用户在竖握手机时拍摄横置照片，相比之下三星的升级策略显得比较保守。

据IT之家此前援引 etnews 消息，三星 Galaxy S26 系列手机中仅有 Ultra 版本会使用 M14 OLED 基材，意味着 Galaxy S 系列将时隔三年得到屏幕基材更新，但 S26 Pro 和 S26 Edge 仍将沿用上代 M13。]]></content>

MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Friday that it had detained a resident of Crimea who provided Ukrainian military intelligence with information about the positions of two S-300 air defense systems on the peninsula. 


"The Federal Security Service of Russia has detained a Russian citizen, born in 1972, in the Republic of Crimea. He was recruited by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine to collect intelligence information regarding military installations on the peninsula and to prepare sabotage and terrorist acts," the FSB said in a statement. 

On instructions from Kiev, the detainee removed components of an improvised explosive device from a cache and sent photos and videos of the positions of two S-300 anti-aircraft missile systems in Crimea, along with their coordinates, to the Ukrainian special services via WhatsApp, the statement read.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[IT之家 10 月 3 日消息，日本村田制作所、早稻田大学、机器人制造商 tmsuk 等 10 月 2 日发布消息称，计划明年 3 月进行纯国产人形机器人试制，拟明年年末完成分别重视功率和追求高聪敏度的两款试制机。

tmsuk 新闻稿称，近年来，以美国大型科技企业和中国的 IT、电动汽车、机器人企业为中心，人形机器人开发正迅速推进。“日本作为曾经的机器人先进国家，必须展现其存在感。”
此外，日本国内自然灾害和劳动力不足等社会问题日益严重，对机器人技术的期待也在提高。特别是具有类似人类动作性能、能在极端环境下活动的人形机器人，作为下一代机械系统备受关注。
随着 AI 和软件的进步，硬件领域的国产开发体制和作为产业的整体合作尚未完善。为了打破这些难题，在制造业之都京都，多方以集结日本技术力量的新产业合作框架为宗旨，成立了“KyoHA”（京都人形机器人协会）。

目前，多家企业机构已作为成员参与其中，同时正与众多企业团体进行合作洽谈。作为跨越产业界和学术界的“为人形机器人而成立的日本联盟”，今后将继续广泛招募参与者。
为实现实用性高的人形机器人，该联盟将制造初始原型机。之后，联盟将制造两种系統的人形机器人：一种能发挥功率的模型，一种具备敏捷性 / 功能性的模型。

IT之家从新闻稿获悉，该联盟于 2025 年 8 月完成一般社团法人的设立，计划在 2026 年度内公布面向第一弹开发与实施的具体措施。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[國慶中秋長假，內地不少民眾出門遠行。有旅遊業界人士指，今年遊客消費比往年審慎。

從北京市中心出發，約兩小時車程，來到市郊懷柔區，這裡座落不少民宿，各有特色。

這間千多呎的民宿，有泳池、卡拉OK房，可以打桌球、燒烤，附近又有著名餐廳、咖啡店，前幾年很搶手，但今年國慶中秋假期開始，由原價五千至六千元人民幣一晚，減價至約四千元人民幣一晚，仍然乏人問津。

陳蕾旗下有百多間民宿，均屬中、高檔類型。她指即使多了在網上宣傳，又減價促銷，今個長假入住率只有約一半，是近年最差。

民宿集團創辦人陳蕾表示：「客人問民宿，首先會說『我預算就這麼多，你們有沒有這個價位的民宿？』能感受到客人的口袋內，相對會比較緊一點點。」

過往入住的多數是一家大小，今年就有很多公司客。

陳蕾說：「他們團建之前可能會去出境，或國內目的地，他們因為預算縮緊，可能會選擇一些京郊的團建方式。」

民宿負責人指，顧客現在明顯比以往審慎，多了格價，又要求實地拍片，看清楚現場環境才預訂。

八天長假，不少內地民眾選擇出國旅行。北京有旅行社指，長線團來說，以高加索地區最突出，因為團費相對便宜，又能感受歐洲風情，加上阿塞拜疆七月起向中國旅客提供免簽證，能省卻一筆費用，都是吸引之處。

北京旅遊集團董事長曹益偉稱：「新開放的免簽地區，我們就會特別作為一個顯著特點推向市場。疫情前，大家都去知名目的地，疫情後這種地方反而火起來。」

旅行社預計生意額與往年相若，今年不敢加團費，希望靠品質和服務留住顧客。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[SINGAPORE — For decades, private markets have been the preserve of pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth giants. Now, that exclusivity is fading. More wealthy individuals are getting invited into a once-closed club reserved for long-term investments from large institutions — and that is ruffling feathers. The trend has been described by experts as the democratization of private markets: looser eligibility rules, feeder funds that pool money from smaller investors and channel into larger funds, and products that mimic mutual funds but invest in private assets. In the U.S., President Donald Trump's August 2025 order allowed retirement solution providers to invest in private equity and other alternative assets, allowing greater access to private markets for everyday savers. It could lower returns. And it could lead to bigger issues down the road. Group CIO at GIC Bryan Yeo Further, major private market asset managers from KKR to Blackstone to Apollo have been rolling out vehicles that allow smaller-ticket investments compared to the $8 million-plus average commitment from their traditional investors such as pension funds, endowments and insurance companies. "We're seeing that trend pick up. We do think private markets over time will get increasingly commoditized and democratized," Bryan Yeo, group chief investment officer of Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC, said at the Milken Institute Asia Summit held in Singapore. In the United States, retail investors are those with net worth under $1 million (excluding primary residence) and income under $200,000. Institutional investors come with deep resources, due-diligence teams and the ability to lock up capital for several years. They have been private markets' biggest backers, and now the entry of retail investors has them worried. "If there is going to be a flood of money coming in the next 12-18 months, that could be a problem because that would mean deployment of large amounts of inflows into what's a limited set of good opportunities, which could then lead to a lowering of underwriting standards," Yeo said. "It could lower returns. And it could lead to bigger issues down the road." Rising worries During the Milken Institute Asia Summit, other experts warned that retail inflows could distort pricing, erode returns and destabilize fund structures designed for long-term investments or patient capital. "Traditional institutions have been very concerned about the influx of private wealth money and raising of private wealth money across private markets," said Debra Ng, partner and Asia regional head of Albourne, a consultancy firm for LPs. "We are seeing a concern about alignment," Ng said at a Milken panel discussion, referring to potentially differing incentives and liquidity expectations among retail investors, fund managers and LPs. Geeta Kapadia, chief investment officer at Fordham University, echoed similar concerns, cautioning that mass retail flows could upend how private markets function. "Part of the selling point of investing as an institution is that you are able to take the illiquidity risk, the time risk, and you'll be rewarded for that. And I worry that the flow of retail investors … could have an impact going forward," she said at a separate Milken panel. Traditionally, PE funds have been designed for decades-long commitments and infrequent cash flows, while individuals generally want quicker returns and higher liquidity. "Sometimes they just don't connect," Kapadia said. If institutional and retail investors' goals diverge, private markets could lose their long-term focus. Managers may hold more cash or shorten deal horizons to meet retail liquidity demands, the speakers concurred. During times of stress, sudden retail redemptions could force asset sales at discounts, triggering liquidity crunches and pricing shocks in what have generally been stable markets. Yup Kim, chief investment officer of Texas Municipal Retirement System highlighted differences in alignment, noting that retail investors may also have a "greater appetite for returns" and are less margin sensitive than institutions. Margin-sensitivity refers to being focused on fees and net cost efficiency — institutions like pensions and endowments often negotiate hard on management fees, performance fees, and deal terms. "A lot of institutional investors are concerned," he said. 'Semi-liquid' alternatives Private-equity managers are aware of their traditional investors' concerns about retail participation. Their solution: semi-liquid funds. "What we have seen is a proliferation in the emergence of semi-liquid vehicles. They allow investors to come in and out on a monthly or quarterly basis," said Wen Ting Geok, Mercer Alternatives' head of private equity in Asia. "It's not fully liquid, but then it really gives them exposure to the asset class that is generally on the private side," she told CNBC. According to Deloitte , the number of semi-liquid funds nearly doubled to 455 in 2024 from 238 in 2020. A global survey conducted by State Street recently showed that 56% of the institutional investors expect more than half of of the private market flows in the near future to come via retail-style or semi-liquid vehicles. Kapadia acknowledged that semi-liquid funds try to bridge the liquidity gap, but cautioned that investors might not be able to get all their money should they want to cash out. "It may not be as liquid as you think if there's a stress event." she said. Another concern cited amongst Milken conference attendees was also the idea of forced buying, and how it could drive up asset prices. "Sometimes, these retail vehicles are forced to deploy capital quickly," said Texas Municipal Retirement System's Kim. That is why it's a "great time" to be a seller in private market as retail-oriented private-market funds are willing to pay much higher prices due to their compulsion to buy, Kim said. "I don't know that that's the best underwriting discipline for long term risk, addresses, returns." Expanding the pie Experts say that private-market democratization is here to stay. Private-equity firms are hunting for new capital pools as institutional allocations mature and growth slows. Over the past few years, private-equity fundraising has suffered a sustained downturn. In the first half of 2025, private-equity funds globally raised about $384 billion, down 17% from the same period last year — their weakest first-half total since the pandemic year of 2020. As markets evolve, we believe democratization done thoughtfully can expand the pie, rather than simply redistribute it. Partner at NewVest Ariel Ezrahi In such an environment, expanding retail-facing funds becomes an appealing lever, providing access to fresh money even as the traditional institutional pipeline weakens, private-equity players told CNBC. "As markets evolve, we believe democratization done thoughtfully can expand the pie, rather than simply redistribute it," said Ariel Ezrahi, a partner at NewVest, a private markets index manager. "A deeper, more liquid, and more transparent private market ecosystem benefits managers, investors, and the industry as a whole." Executives such as HostPlus' CEO David Elia argue that the solution is not to shut retail out but to refine safeguards. "There needs to be differentiation between regulation for what I would call mum and dad, retail investors … and institutional investors … who've got the level of sophistication and understanding to effectively identify the right opportunities," he said. Private markets are expected to grow to more than $20 trillion by 2030 from an estimated $13 trillion currently, according to BlackRock. And retail flows will play an important role in their growth. According to Deloitte's projections , retail investors' contributions to private capital could soar to $2.4 trillion by 2030 in the United States from current estimates of $80 billion, and more than triple in the European Union to 3.3 trillion euros ($3.9 trillion) from 924 billion euros. "I do feel the retailization, the democratization story will kind of deepen," said Ankur Meattle, head of Asia private equity funds & co-investments at GIC. "The prevalence and the acceptance of the asset class is still limited in terms of [retail] investor potential [relative] to the institutions. But over five years, 10 years, it'll meaningfully broaden."]]></content>

Lim Kimya's widow wants to find out who "ordered" the Cambodian politician's killing


ByKoh Ewe

A Thai court has sentenced a man to life in prison for killing a prominent Cambodian opposition politician in Bangkok.
In January, hours after Lim Kimya arrived in the Thai capital with his wife, he was shot dead in public by Thai national Ekkalak Paenoi. Ekkalak then fled to Cambodia, where he was arrested and deported.
Ekkalak had initially been handed the death penalty, but that was commuted to life imprisonment because of his confession to the killing, the court said on Friday.
The reason behind Lim Kimya's killing remains unclear - though it has been widely suspected to be a politically motivated assassination.


Opposition politicians and activists are often jailed and harassed in Cambodia, where authorities have little tolerance for political dissent.
Lim Kimya, who had dual Cambodian and French nationality, was a former parliamentarian from Cambodia's main opposition party, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP).
The CNRP had come close to defeating the long-ruling party of former leader Hun Sen in 2013.
After Hun Sen accused the CNRP of treason, the party was banned in 2017 and its members were prohibited from taking part in political activities.
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet - who succeeded his father Hun Sen in 2023 - has denied that the government was involved in Lim's killing.
Security camera footage from January showed Ekkalak parking his motorbike, removing his helmet and walking calmly across the road before shots rang out.
Ekkalak was also found guilty of carrying and using a firearm, and ordered to pay around $55,000 (£40,800) to Lim Kimya's family.
The court dismissed a charge against another defendant - a Thai national accused of driving Ekkalak to the Cambodian border after the shooting - on the grounds that he was only a driver who did not know about the killing.
The lawyer for Lim Kimya's widow told news agency AFP that she was "probably satisfied" with Friday's verdict, though she was "still questioning who ordered the crime".
"She wants authorities to get to the bottom of it."
In recent years dozens of activists fleeing repression in Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand have been sent back after seeking sanctuary, or in some cases have been killed or disappeared. 
Human rights groups believe there is an unwritten agreement among the four neighbouring countries to allow each other's security forces to pursue dissidents over the border.

Luxembourg has enthroned a new head of state on Friday, after Grand Duke Henri abdicated the throne to his son Guillaume.
Grand Duke Henri, 70, ended his 25-year reign of the small European nation, with a population of about 680,000 people, in a ceremony at the Grand Ducal Palace.
The 43-year-old Guillaume was then crowned after swearing an oath to Luxembourg's constitution in front of guests, including representatives from the Dutch and Belgian royal families.
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, will be among those attending a gala dinner in Luxembourg City later Friday.

Grand Duke Guillaume not expected to change status quo
Although Guillaume is almost 30 years younger than his father, the new head of state is not expected to change a great deal in the nation.
The head of state of the world's last remaining grand duchy enacts laws and performs representative functions. 

However, many expect the 43-year-old to offer a slightly warmer touch to the job. 
Luxembourg is one of the European Union's smallest nations and its richest per capita, seen as a financial powerhouse that hosts important EU institutions like the European Court of Justice and the European Investment Bank.
Transition began in 2024
Grand Duke Henri began a transition period in 2024 after saying he wished to "slow down." 

Guillaume, who has two sons, was educated in Luxembourg and Switzerland before attending Sandhurst Military School in the United Kingdom.
He then earned a double degree in arts and political science from the University of Angers in France. 
After he is sworn in on Friday, the new grand duke greeted the public from a balcony overlooking a central square. Over the weekend, he will take a traditional tour of the small nation concluding with Sunday Mass at the Catholic Notre-Dame de Luxembourg cathedral.

据商务部官网，商务部新闻发言人就墨西哥近日连续对我发起多起反倾销调查答记者问。
问：据报道，墨西哥近日连续对中国的浮法玻璃、自粘胶带、聚氯乙烯涂塑布和钢制螺栓发起反倾销调查。商务部对此有何回应？
答：我们注意到，墨西哥经济部应国内企业申请，近日连续对我浮法玻璃、聚氯乙烯涂塑布等产品发起4起反倾销调查。中方坚决反对损害中方正当权益的保护主义行为，将密切关注墨方调查进展，敦促墨方在调查中严格遵守世贸组织规则，保障中国企业的合法权益。
今年以来，墨西哥对中国产品的反倾销调查已达11起，几乎为去年立案总数的两倍，而中方一直审慎克制发起贸易救济调查。中方认为，在当前美方滥施关税的背景下，各国应共同反对单边主义，不应放任保护主义蔓延，更不应在他人胁迫下以各种名目对华设限。
商务部已依据《对外贸易法》和《对外贸易壁垒调查规则》有关规定，就墨西哥拟对华提高进口关税和其他贸易投资限制措施启动贸易投资壁垒调查。中方将根据调查结果和实际情况，采取包括贸易、投资领域在内的一切必要措施，坚决维护企业合法权益。]]></content>

A Finnish district court on Friday dismissed a case against the captain and two officers of the Eagle S oil tanker who were accused of breaking undersea power and internet cables in the Baltic Sea, saying Finland does not have jurisdiction to prosecute them.
"The District Court has today issued a judgment dismissing the charge in the case... along with the claims for damages arising from the charge, as it was not possible to apply Finnish criminal law to the case," the court said in a statement.
What is the Baltic cable cut case about?
The incident took place on December 25 last year when a string of cable and gas pipeline outages in the Baltic Sea prompted NATO forces in the region to to go on high alert.
The crew is accused of dragging the ship's anchor in the seabed for about 90 kilometers (56 miles), damaging five undersea cables in the Gulf of Finalnd.
Finnish prosecutors had argued that  the crew neglected their duties intentionally after leaving the Russian port of Ust-Luga.
All three crew members deny the allegations and said they were unaware that the anchor was not in order.
"If a ship drags an anchor behind it for several hours for 90 kilometers, is it really possible that no one would notice?" prosecutor Mikko Larkia had said at the start of the trial.

Europe's undersea cables under attack?

Why is the case important?
The December 25th incident is only one of several similar occurences over the last two years.
Some officials and experts have pointed it out as Russian sabotage. Others have called it an accident.
Russia has denied the allegations.
The Eagle S crew is believed to be a part of Russia's "shadow fleet," a group of old oil tankers operated under various flags but controlled by Moscow to bypass sanctions imposed by Europe and the US over Russia's war in Ukraine.
The case in Finland was the first attempt to convict the suspected perpetrators but the matter is complicated due to international maritime laws and difficulty in proving intent.

苹果今年为 iPhone 17 标准版升级了 Promotion 技术显示屏，基础款售价仍维持 799 美元（IT之家注：现汇率约合 5693 元人民币），成为苹果近年来“性价比最高”机型，销售较为火热，推动三星显示和 LG Display 订单增长，使得 LG Display 创下了 15 个季度以来最高利润纪录。

UBI Research 的调研数据显示，三星显示将为苹果供应 7800 万块 OLED 面板，而 LG Display 则供应 4560 万块，同时根据大信证券数据，LG Display 在今年第三季度的营业利润预计为 4480 亿韩元（现汇率约合 22.74 亿元人民币），营收额则为 6.87 万亿韩元（现汇率约合 348.65 亿元人民币）。

展望未来，LG Display 明年的订单量还将继续增长，其 2026 年营业利润预计可达 1 万亿韩元（现汇率约合 50.75 亿元人民币），不过这些数据都是基于目前 iPhone 17 标准版的供需关系，如果明年需求有下滑状况，LG 势必会受到影响，但不容忽视的是，苹果 iPhone 17 标准版确实带动了供应链业绩飞跃。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[英國曼徹斯特猶太會堂襲擊案，事件中造成2死4重傷，疑犯被擊斃，警方公布疑犯是一名35歲敘利亞裔英國公民，正調查犯案動機。

網上流傳片段可見，兩名警察用槍指向一名倒在地上的男子。當時涉案男子已被警員開槍擊中。其後警察舉手示意附近的人後退。

警方表示，這名被擊斃的男疑犯35歲，名為阿什邁，敘利亞裔，據報他年幼時移居英國，2006年成為英國公民。警方一度懷疑該男子身上綁有炸彈。後來確認他身上的可疑裝置並不是有效炸彈，過程中並沒有發生爆炸。

案發在英國曼徹斯特北部，警方當地周四早上九時半過後接報，指在一座猶太會堂外，有人駕車衝向人群，並持刀襲擊。到場的警員開槍擊斃疑犯。大曼徹斯特警方將這起襲擊案定性為恐怖襲擊。

初步調查顯示，疑犯不是英國反恐計劃中的目標對象。目前警方正在調查其犯案動機和所有相關線索。事件中另有三人因涉嫌委託、籌備或煽動恐怖主義行動被捕，分別是兩名30多歲男人及一名60多歲女人。

案發這日是猶太曆中被視為神聖日子的「贖罪日」，象徵神的審判，猶太人會聚集在會堂內，懺悔、禁食和禱告。

英國首相施紀賢對襲擊表示震驚，隨即由丹麥哥本哈根回國，主持政府緊急會議，又指鑒於日益高漲的反猶太主義，他承諾加強猶太社區的安全。英王查理斯三世亦對襲擊深表震驚及哀悼。

以色列外長薩爾批評英國政府，最近決定承認巴勒斯坦國，指責英國當局未能遏制反猶太主義，允許它持續存在。

英國有關注組織表示，近年國內反猶太主義事件增加，單是今年上半年就有1,500多宗，是去年數字創新高以來的第二高。]]></content>

Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the potential supply of long-range missiles to Ukraine would mark a "completely new stage of escalation" between Washington and Moscow.
Speaking on Thursday at a forum in Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin conceded that the supply of "powerful" U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles to Kyiv posed a threat to Russia but would not change the situation on the battlefield.

"Can Tomahawks harm us? They can. But we will shoot them down and improve our air defense system," Putin said, according to an NBC translation.
"Using Tomahawks without the direct participation of American military personnel is impossible. This would mark a qualitatively new, completely new stage of escalation between Russia and the U.S.," he added.
His comments come shortly after it was reported the U.S. would provide Ukraine with intelligence on long-range energy infrastructure targets deep inside Russia, a move that would represent a significant shift in White House support for Kyiv.

Trump, in a major shift, says Ukraine can win back territory from Russia



The Wall Street Journal and Reuters, citing unnamed U.S. officials, both reported on Wednesday that President Donald Trump's administration had approved intelligence sharing with Ukraine, while weighing up whether to send Tomahawk cruise missiles to Kyiv.
CNBC has contacted the White House for comment.
The supply of Tomahawk cruise missiles, which are known to have a range of at least 1,500 miles (roughly 2,400 kilometers), would significantly boost Ukraine's ability to strike Russian targets.

Putin responds to 'paper tiger' criticism

Asked about Trump's recent characterization of Russia as a "paper tiger," Putin said Russian troops "confidently" held the strategic initiative and were making gains in Ukraine.
"But if we're fighting the entire NATO bloc and we're moving forward, feeling confident, and it's a paper tiger. What then of NATO itself? What does it represent?" Putin said.
A paper tiger is a term that typically refers to a force that appears powerful but is ineffective.
The U.S. president, in a major rhetorical shift, also said last month that Ukraine could retake territory captured by Russia.

In a social media post published Sept. 23, Trump said his view came after "getting to know and fully understand" Russia and Ukraine's military and economic situation, noting what he described as the "economic trouble" that the conflict is causing in Moscow.
The U.S. president has previously suggested Ukraine would need to be open to giving up some of its territory in peace talks, which Washington has taken steps to broker since the start of Trump's second mandate.
Russia, meanwhile, is poised to hike taxes on business and consumers as the government looks for ways to support its war-focused economy after more than three-and-half years of conflict.

Airspace incursions

European Union political leaders on Wednesday backed plans for a so-called drone wall on the region's eastern flank, seeking to bolster its defenses and repel Russia following a series of airspace incursions in recent weeks.
Defense giants have welcomed the concept, although the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, has not yet produced a plan on how to finance and operate the project.
Putin on Thursday said the Kremlin is "closely monitoring" what he described as the "growing militarization of Europe. Is it just empty talk, or is it time for us to take countermeasures?"

Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Romania — EU and NATO members on Europe's northern and eastern flank close to Russia — have all recently reported airspace incursions allegedly involving Russian jets or drones.
Germnany, Denmark and Norway, meanwhile, have also reported unidentified drones in their airspace in recent days, with the incidents leading to significant disruption to airports and air traffic.
Russia has previously denied it's behind the drone provocations against its European neighbors, describing them as "unfounded accusations."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The Nobel Prize is considered the "Mount Everest of science." But it faces criticism over how winners are chosen, and may give a warped idea of scientific progress.  
    Science has changed since the Nobel Prize was first awarded in 1901. Is it time to forge a new way of recognizing outstanding science? Image: JONATHAN NACKSTRAND/AFP/Getty Images   
Every October, a handful of scientists get woken up by a phone call to find out they've won a Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine, physics or chemistry.
Startled and bleary-eyed, they throw a shirt on over their pajamas, join a video call to Stockholm and try to explain a lifetime's worth of research to the world's media in a few short minutes.
Journalists then desperately try to understand what "quantum dots," or "entangled photons" are, file their reports, then breathe a sigh of relief that it's all over until next year. By the following week everyone's forgotten — another flash in an endless news cycle.
Be honest, who really cares about Nobel Prizes? Are these prizes, first awarded in 1901, with all their high-class pomp and ceremony, still relevant today?
The Nobel Prizes do help to popularize scientific discoveries. But do they also give a false impression of how discoveries are made? Are they too biased in favoring science from the US, Europe and men?


Noble idea behind the Nobel Prize
The Nobel Prizes originated from one guilt-ridden scientist's final will and testament — Alfred Nobel, inventor of dynamite.
Nobel's goal was to reward outstanding science to "those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind."
Nobel Prizes are meaningful milestones for scientific advances. They credit how millions of people were protected from severe COVID-19 infections from rapid vaccine development , the invention of energy-saving LED lights and gene-editing technologies which have cured previously untreatable diseases.
"Doubtless they're the Mount Everest of science. The Nobel Prizes show the pinnacle of scientific discoveries, and there's an emotive attachment to them," said Rajib Dasgupta, a physician and professor of public health based in New Delhi, India.
If anything, the prizes help remind us that we're fortunate to live in an age of new scientific advances, after DNA, after vaccinations, after theories of the big bang and sub-atomic particles.


Do Nobel Prizes really inspire people about science?
The Nobel Prizes are certainly a useful way to capture the public imagination about science when they are elevated to the platform of mass media.
The extent to which media outlets cover the Nobel Prizes varies by country, but Dasgupta said the prizes are closely followed by the Indian media — and that in detail, rather than just for the news.
"The interest comes from an educational tilt towards STEM subjects in India, particularly among the middle class," Dasgupta told DW, referring to science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
Teaching children about the Nobel Prizes is embedded in the Indian school curriculum to get people interested in science, as it is around the world.
Lily Green, a biology teacher at a high school for 11-to-18-year-olds in Newbury, UK, said she taught a historical perspective of the Nobel Prizes in her science classes, but didn't follow the prize announcements every October.
"We use them to teach the more fundamental concepts of science. The best discoveries are those that capture kids' imagination with scandals or great stories — like [Barry Marshall] who infected himself with bacteria to show how they cause ulcers," said Green.
But Green doubted whether the Nobel Prizes played much of a role in inspiring students to study science at university.
"They're generally captivated and interested in science, not because they want to win a Nobel Prize," she told DW.

Myth of the genius scientist
In the first years of the Nobel Prizes, they were mostly awarded to individual gentlemen scientists, such as Albert Einstein or Rutherford.
Marie Curie's gender — in terms of the ratio between male and female scientists — was, and still is, an exception. But Curie was also awarded two Nobel Prizes, so she was a double exception.
The prizes helped build the idea of the genius scientist — one who single-handedly drove science forward with their sheer brilliance.

But in reality, scientific progress operates very differently, especially in contemporary research.
Scientific discoveries are born from collaborations between hundreds of researchers around the world from different research fields. Science is a community — it is multidisciplinary and diverse.
Now, Nobel Prizes are commonly split between groups of scientists. But for every Nobel laureate, there are thousands of other scientists, Ph.D. students and technicians who were part of the research — and did the experiments — but remain uncredited, at least among the general public.
Green agreed there was a tendency to overplay the work of individual scientists at the Nobel Prizes, but also felt that the idea of the solo genius scientist is waning.
"We're teaching more and more that science is a collaborative effort. It helps the kids to see the amount of work that goes into scientific discoveries," she said.
Lack of diversity in Nobel Prizes
The biggest criticisms of the Nobel Prizes relate to their lack of diversity and bias toward Western scientific institutions.
In the sciences, less than 15% of Nobel laureates are women.
And very few people from countries outside Europe and the US have won a Nobel Prize in Science. The US, UK and Germany dominate the rankings for the number of Nobel laureates, totaling 468 among them. China has eight and India has 12 Nobel laureates.
The 2022 Physics Nobel Prize was one of the most anticipated for years: It had been expected that Aspect, Clauser and Zeilinger would be recognized for their work with 'entangled photons.' But what of the hundreds of other scientists who contributed to their field?Image: Ren Pengfei/Xinhua/IMAGO

"Most prizes are very deserving, but they're not without politics. Institutions in many countries are being overlooked, including India. And certainly, Nobel Prize committees are not as inclusive as they need to be," said Dasgupta.
Nobel Prizes can also exacerbate this inequality by diverting more funding to institutions which have already won prizes and the recognition that follows.
But Dasgupta said the reality was that institutions in India and elsewhere had to get stronger to compete with the US or Europe — only then would those countries be able to hold onto the talent they have created.

SK 海力士在 2023 的 DRAM 月晶圆投片量仅有 30 万片，换句话说该企业在三年内翻倍了按晶圆计的内存产能。这一数值也将与三星半导体明年下半年的内存生产能力大致相当。

SK 海力士对 DRAM 产能的大力投资离不开该企业目前在 HBM 上的主导地位。业内预计今年其整体 DRAM 产能中将有约 30% 用于 HBM 生产，而到 2027 年这一比例有望上升到近 40%；此外单位 bit 产出下 HBM 对晶圆的消耗是一般内存的数倍。
相较于市场火热的 DRAM，SK 海力士对 NAND 闪存的投资则相对保守，这是由于两部分市场状况和盈利能力的差异。]]></content>

新图标采用了更加现代化的设计风格，色彩更丰富，形状更圆润，与微软近年来在 Fluent 体系上的探索保持一致。

根据微软介绍，此次共有 10 个核心 Office 应用图标进行了重构，灵感部分来源于 Copilot 图标设计。这一调整不仅体现了更统一的设计系统，也反映出 Copilot 在 Microsoft 365 中的影响力。

新图标采用了更丰富的渐变色彩和更高的对比度；设计上摒弃了之前的锐利边缘和直线，改用更柔和的曲线和折叠效果，营造出更具动感和亲和力的视觉体验。

微软 365 设计与研究企业副总裁 Jon Friedman 表示：“核心的 10 个 Office 应用上一次更新是在 2018 年，当时我们使用的语言几乎与今天相同：连接、一致性、无缝协作、流畅过渡。新的图标散发出流动感和趣味性，同时更加简洁、直观，并且具备高度可访问性。”

与谷歌近期的标志设计类似，微软此次也采用了渐变色方案。Friedman 解释称：“过去的渐变色较为微妙，而现在更为浓烈和鲜艳，夸张的类比过渡提升了辨识度。”

在细节方面，新图标也进行了简化。例如 Word 图标过去由四条横线构成，现在改为三条，以改善小图标状态下的可读性。

Friedman 补充道：“我们从粗犷、静态的坚实感转向更柔和、流动的形态。锐利的边缘和清晰的线条被顺滑的折叠和曲线取代，使图标更具动感和亲和力。”

微软表示，这些新图标将在未来数周内逐步向消费者与企业用户推送，覆盖网页、桌面和移动端的 Microsoft 365 平台。IT之家后续将保持关注。]]></content>

Published
8 hours ago




The "area of interest" flagged in a volunteer-led search for the body of a British girl who vanished in Australia 55 years ago has turned out to be a false alarm, New South Wales Police said.
A volunteer team who used cadaver detection dogs in search of Cheryl Grimmer had hoped their finding would be a breakthrough in the case which has remained a mystery since she disappeared in 1970, when she was three.
But bones that were found in the area belong to an animal, police said in response to the BBC's queries, adding that the search had "concluded".
Authorities suspect Cheryl, who had emigrated from Bristol with her family, was abducted from Fairy Meadow beach in Wollongong in January 1970.


Thursday's search happened in Balgownie, on a small pocket of woodland mentioned in a confession made by a teenage boy.
In 2019, a trial of the suspect, known only by a codename, Mercury, who'd been charged with Cheryl's abduction and murder, collapsed. The man, in his 60s then, had denied any wrongdoing.
Prosecutors later dropped charges against him as a judge disallowed the confession he made as a minor.
Authorities have conducted numerous searches in the decades since Cheryl disappeared, but have found few clues as to what happened to her. 
NSW authorities have offered a A$1m ($660,000; £491,000) reward for information on Cheryl's abduction and suspected murder.
Cheryl's brother Ricki Nash, 62, has publicly highlighted what he believes are errors in the police investigation dating back to the day she went missing.
Mr Nash was seven then. He last saw his sister in the changing rooms at Fairy Meadow on the day she disappeared.
A petition asking the state parliament to set up an inquiry into missing persons investigations overseen by NSW Police, such as Cheryl's, gathered more than 10,000 signatures this summer.
It was debated in parliament, but in a letter responding to petitioners, state authorities made no commitment to holding an inquiry.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[中印复航可能重新塑造亚洲航空市场格局。
   
印度和中国将在时隔五年后恢复直航航班，这是自疫情以来两国首次重启直航。
根据印度驻华大使馆发布的最新消息，中印双方已达成共识，印中两国间连接指定通航点的直飞航线，可于2025年10月底前恢复。具体实施需以两国指定航空公司的商业决策为准，并需满足所有运营标准。
印度最大航空公司靛蓝航空（IndiGo）今日已率先宣布恢复往返中国的航班，自2025年10月26日起将开通从加尔各答直飞广州的航线。
印度航空（Air India）也计划重返中国市场。
在此之前还有消息称，国航将执飞北京首都-天府-新德里，东航要执飞上海浦东-昆明-新德里。不过目前相关航司尚未披露具体航班计划。
记者查询航班管家数据显示，在疫情前的2019年10月，中印之间的承运人中，中方有4家。
其中东航的航班量最大，占比24.2%，主要执飞上海-新德里和昆明-加尔各答；南航的航班量占比22.9%，从广州直飞新德里；国航的中印航班量比占12.4%，主要执飞北京-新德里，北京-孟买，山航的航班量占6.4%，从昆明直飞新德里。
印度有2家航司执飞中印航班，其中靛蓝航空的航班量占20.8%，主要执飞成都-新德里和广州-加尔各答；印度航空的航班量占8.2%，从上海直飞新德里。
由此可见，六家航司的中印航线主要集中在北上广飞新德里，成都和昆明飞新德里，北京和广州飞孟买，昆明和广州飞加尔各答。
其中广州-新德里的航班量最多，占比22.9%，其次是上海-新德里和昆明-加尔各答，占比19.6%和12.9%。
在恢复直航前，中印之间的签证政策已率先优化。今年7月，印度在多年限制后恢复向中国公民发放旅游签证；8月，两国外长在新德里达成推动双边贸易与投资的共识。
中印复航后，也可能重新塑造亚洲航空市场格局。此前有不少印度旅客通过中国香港，新加坡风中转去欧美，中国旅客往返印度也主要依赖中国香港、泰国等中转枢纽。记者今年六月去印度就是乘坐的国泰航空，航班客座率很高。而中印直航的开通将吸引不少印度客源通过北上广枢纽飞欧美。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[IT之家 10 月 3 日消息，传奇芯片架构师、“硅仙人”吉姆・凯勒在接受日经亚洲的采访时，就英特尔前沿工艺发表了看法：英特尔正被考虑用于尖端芯片，但仍有很多工作要做才能交付一款可靠的产品。
他指出，英特尔在代工能力上仍需改进。目前市场对英特尔代工芯片的评价不一，此前业内专家对 18A 或 14A 工艺几乎没有发表意见。这次，吉姆・凯勒则表达了乐观态度。

他表示，自己的公司 Tenstorrent 不排斥使用英特尔最先进的工艺，但英特尔还需要进一步努力以确保芯片的外部产量。“我们正在与台积电、Rapidus 和三星商讨 2nm 工艺。我们也会考虑让英特尔来生产芯片，但他们仍有大量工作要做…… 以提供真正可靠的技术路径。”
英特尔正在积极寻找外部合作伙伴使用其 18A 及未来工艺，目的是让代工部门从仅服务内部转向向客户开放芯片。据外媒 Wccftech 报道，吉姆・凯勒的评论表明，断言“英特尔工艺尚不适合客户使用”并不准确；实际上，英特尔正在快速推进芯片开发，只要这一势头保持下去就有潜力融入主流产品。
吉姆・凯勒拥有一家 AI 初创公司 Tenstorrent，该公司基于 RISC-V 架构设计 AI 产品，AI 芯片研发进展稳健。此前报道显示，Tenstorrent 正关注 Rapidus 的 2nm 工艺，凯勒也确认了这一计划。因此，2nm 工艺将在 Tenstorrent 的未来产品中发挥关键作用，而吉姆・凯勒几乎已接触到所有主流芯片厂商。
据IT之家了解，吉姆・凯勒是半导体行业的标志性人物。他曾在 AMD、苹果、英特尔和特斯拉工作过，因此他的观点和洞察力在业内备受重视。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[抹茶飲品受不少人喜愛，在美國同樣受歡迎，但面對全球抹茶價格飆升，抹茶愛好者需做好「捱貴茶」的準備。

這杯鮮綠色的抹茶牛奶，最近在社交媒體上刷屏，從日本「紅」到美國。

有三藩市飲品店老闆說：「我們的抹茶飲品每天賣出數百杯。」

日本茶道中的抹茶，傳統上是以茶筅，將抹茶粉和水，打散至形成濃厚的泡沫後享用。如今抹茶廣泛用於飲品和甜點中，成為不少人的至愛。

一名三藩市飲品店顧客表示：「我每天早上都喝抹茶，它是我最常喝的飲品，我以它作為新一天的開始。」

有美國茶葉採購商指出，過去一兩年，抹茶需求以前所未有的速度增長。不過日本在熱浪侵襲下，抹茶收成減少，全球抹茶面臨供不應求，價格大幅攀升，預計日本抹茶今年價格上漲百分之70。

而在美國，出產自日本以至中國的抹茶，更受加徵關稅政策影響，增加商戶成本壓力。

三藩市一間飲品店老闆透露，店裡每月消耗數百公斤抹茶，然而價格卻在短期內翻倍上漲。當地抹茶愛好者，未來相信要準備好為更昂貴的抹茶產品買單。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[A major scientific update to one of the most influential food and planetary health reports of the past decade is in the crosshairs of a pro-meat misinformation campaign.

A healthy diet, for people and the planet, would include a more varied menu of nut and legumes, whole grains and plenty of fruits and vegetables, with significantly less meat, dairy products and sugar.
That's the relatively straightforward message from the EAT-Lancet Commission, an independent scientific body working with the influential British medical journal. On Friday, it presented a major update to its 2019 report on healthy diets that are also good for the environment, findings which have been widely accepted by global health and environmental experts.
"Food systems generate roughly 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions," said Johan Rockström, commission co-chair and director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, speaking in a media briefing earlier this week.
Rockström outlined new research from more than 35 countries and six continents showing that including healthy foods in dietary guidelines, tackling food loss and waste, choosing local products and shifting to sustainable agricultural practices could reduce stress on the environment and cut those emissions by more than half — and prevent up to 15 million premature deaths every year.
"By uniting the latest science on health and climate, it shows that what we put on our plates can save millions of lives, cut billions of tons of emissions, halt the loss of biodiversity and create a fairer food system," he said. 


'Coordinated campaign' against health and sustainability findings
Despite widespread acceptance of this "planetary health diet" — the commission's first report in 2019 has been cited more than 10,000 times — that message hasn't gone over well in online communities devoted to boosting meat-centered diets as natural, essential and environmentally friendly.
The original report faced a torrent of misinformation on social media, misleading or biased content that disparaged the findings. Climate-focused reporting platform DeSmog wrote in April that it had seen a document appearing to trace the backlash to global PR consultancy Red Flag, which represents the meat and dairy industry. DW contacted Red Flag for comment, but the agency did not respond before publication.
"Food is something people connect with," said Maddy Haughton-Boakes, a senior campaigner at Changing Markets Foundation, a Dutch NGO working to support solutions that benefit society and the environment. "Everybody has a very personal connection with food and what we eat, and people know that. And if you play to that individualism agenda, you can really rile people up and motivate people."

A new investigation by Changing Markets lays out how "industry-friendly scientists, doctors, health influencers, journalists and authors" connected with the meat industry took part in a "targeted and coordinated campaign" to derail the 2019 EAT-Lancet report and its health and sustainability research, with critics portraying it as being "dangerous, elitist and anti-science."
"At the time, a lot of the backlash was presented as organic," Haughton-Boakes told DW. "We know now that it wasn't organic."
She said their research showed how "mis-influencers" tagged and shared each other's content, using similar or identical wording and hashtags like #Yes2Meat, #MeatHeals #ClimateFoodFacts to tout the health and environmental benefits of meat. And, she added, amid the current geopolitical instability and soaring food prices, there have been signs in recent days that this latest report will face the same resistance.
The Changing Markets investigation said many of the people behind the 2019 campaign "are still active and engaging with each other, their reach has grown and the public acceptance or take-up of their ideas has increased." 
"The promotion of carnivore diets has shifted into the mainstream now," said Haughton-Boakes, highlighting the influence of manosphere podcasts and the "Make America Healthy Again" movement in the US under President Donald Trump. "Globally, there's this protein boom and idea that you have to consume vast amounts of meat [and] animal protein for your health."

Social media, AI helping to spread misinformation
Haughton-Boakes said the weakening of fact-checking units and safeguards against misleading information on social media services such as X, Instagram and Facebook over the last year have helped fuel misinformation. As has the rise of AI tools boosting the spread of fake news and convincing deepfake videos and images.
Writing for the Paris-based Geopolitical Studies Group, sociologist Jose Henrique Bortoluci and Emmanuel Guerin, a fellow at the European Climate Foundation, said the relative freedom of social media has fostered an environment in which climate disinformation has flourished.
"Opportunistic individuals take advantage of this environment to generate skepticism and spread misinformation. They have mastered the art of imitating 'expertise' or undermining it, exemplified by the rise of pseudo-experts and think tanks aimed at discrediting climate science," they wrote in July.
In an email to DW, Bortoluci stressed that social media platforms need to be regulated, as with broadcast media and advertising.
"There is no individual or institutional effort that can limit the spread of fake news and the advancement of disinformation campaigns if the platforms themselves are not co-responsible in tackling the problem," he said.
Taking back the 'emotional narrative'
"We all in the [EAT-Lancet] Commission share the same concern over this return… of mis- and disinformation, and denialism on climate science," Rockström told reporters earlier this week, in response to a DW question. But he felt the new report was ready to "meet that assault" with its "rigorous" global scientific assessment.
"We're not dictating any specific one-fit-for-all type of diet," he added, pushing back against a common misinterpretation of the 2019 EAT-Lancet report.

Walter C. Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, pointed out that the planetary health diet was similar to many traditional diets around the world.
Examples of this healthy meal plan will be displayed on the report website in a series of pictures, he said — an apparent effort to connect with people and take back what Bortoluci and Guerin called the "emotional narrative" highjacked by misinformation. 
"[The pictures] make the case that this is not a deprivation diet that we're talking about," said Willett. "This is something that could be delicious, aspirational and healthy."

        <updated>2025-10-03T07:01:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Billionaire and former prime minister Andrej Babis has been linked to all kinds of scandals in Czechia over the years, yet he could become PM again. His party is expected to win this week's parliamentary election.

Andrej Babis has been dressing down for this election campaign trail, opting for jeans and sneakers instead of tailored suits and handmade shoes.   
He sometimes appears at these events wearing a wool sweater, sometimes in a black hoodie featuring his initials, AB, and sometimes in a T-shirt emblazoned with the words "Czechia, everything for you" or "Czechia — against the green madness."
Babis has rarely been seen on big stages during this election campaign, preferring to address small groups or speak from the platform of his election vehicle.
He signs autographs, shakes hands, poses and smiles for selfies and seems to get chirpier the longer the events go on.
This is 71-year-old Andrej Babis, billionaire, populist and controversial former prime minister of the Czech Republic.
Babis pledges to run Czechia like a company
Andrej Babis has often been compared with US President Donald Trump, former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi or Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban. In reality, however, he stands for his very own, Czech brand of populism.

Czechia goes to the polls on Friday and Saturday to elect a new parliament, and opinion polls suggest that Babis will be Czechia's next prime minister with his ANO party.
When Babis appears on the campaign trail, he generally speaks out against "the system" and "corrupt politicians," saying that the political establishment is incapable, bureaucratic and inefficient, that it disregards the people, divides up posts among its own, lies, cheats and wastes money.
He claims that as a successful entrepreneur, he would do things very differently, running the state like a company. He also pledges to listen to the people, clean up the country in their name and help them to lead good and dignified lives.
The billionaire rebel underdog?
But although the billionaire likes to portray himself as the rebellious underdog in a hoodie and as the spokesperson of the poor and downtrodden, he has been part of the country's establishment all his life.
Born in what is now Slovakia, he grew up in a family that belonged to the powerful elite of the communist dictatorship of Czechoslovakia.
Due to his father's work as a trade representative, Babis lived for a time both in Switzerland and in France.
After finishing high school in Geneva, he studied economics in Bratislava and later worked in foreign trade himself in a number of places, including Morocco.
Success in the 1990s
His mysterious rise to the ranks of the super-rich in the Czech Republic began in the "wild 1990s," the period after the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.

In 1995, he assumed ownership of the agricultural and chemical holding Agrofert, which he had previously run as director.
Babis tells a number of different versions of the story of how he came to own Agrofert, though many critics see them as vague and sometimes implausible. Today, Agrofert encompasses about 250 companies worldwide, and Babis is currently estimated to be worth about $3.5 billion (€3 billion).


The move into politics
He says that it was what he calls the intolerable state of the country — corruption, bureaucracy and lack of reforms — that motivated him to enter politics.
In 2011, he founded the ANO movement, which stands for Action of Dissatisfied Citizens and is, at the same time, the Czech word for "yes."
Ever since, ANO's most important slogan has been "Yes, things will get better!" and its promise that Babis will set things to rights in the country.
The Stork's Nest case
The voters gave him the opportunity to do just that: Babis was first finance minister from 2014 to 2017 and then prime minister from 2017 to 2021.
But his tenure became mired in endless debates about his alleged involvement in cases of fraud and corruption. The Stork's Nest was one such case.

The Stork's Nest is a wellness resort near Prague for which Babis was granted EU subsidies. It is alleged that he formally took a company out of the Agrofert Holding for a time to make it eligible for subsidies.
Investigations into the Stork's Nest have been ongoing for almost a decade now. There have already been a number of rulings in the case, and in June of this year, a court in Prague ruled that the entire case had to be reopened.

Babis in the headlines
But the Stork's Nest is just one among many stories about Babis' alleged financial irregularities. For years, he has been in the headlines because of allegations of conflicts of interest, tax evasion, corruption, influencing the media and his past in the secret service of communist Czechoslovakia.
He put his Agrofert Holding into trust funds in 2017. A court later determined that in doing so, he had obscured his role as owner. Babis was forced to sell his media companies in 2023 because of a law governing conflicts of interest.
Like many populist leaders elsewhere, he has long been agitating against migrants and, more recently, against Ukrainian refugees. Nevertheless, it has been reported that his business empire employs numerous workers from non-EU countries such as Vietnam or Ukraine, sometimes under inhuman conditions.
Agent 'Bures'
A court in Slovakia found that Babis once worked as an agent for the Czechoslovak secret service, the StB, under the code name "Bures," though Babis denies this, and the issue has been the subject of numerous lawsuits between him and the Slovakian government. 
Whenever such a controversy pops up, Babis either says that he has "done nothing illegal" or that "the system" wants to take revenge and destroy him.

While he was prime minister, there were mass protests in response to the scandals involving Babis and demonstrations for a "clean country." According to Babis, these were all propaganda activities organized by his enemies.
An opportunistic populist
Unlike his friend Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Babis does not view the European Union as the enemy.
Although he is not the mouthpiece of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whenever there is talk of military support for Ukraine, he like to deflect the conversation, saying that he is "a diplomat, not a soldier."
He has not so far had the political opportunity to reorganize Czechia, but it is not clear whether he actually wants to. It is possible that he is seeking the immunity that would come with being prime minister and would mean he no longer has to be questioned or appear in court.
Babis is a smooth — some observers would even say opportunistic — version of a populist, a restless man with a huge ego.
Babis once told the author of this article that he rarely sleeps, that he "always has to be doing something" and that he actually regrets having entered politics. At the same time, he said, the people in Czechia need him and he cannot let them down.

        <id>https://www.yicai.com/news/102852522.html</id>
        <link href="https://www.yicai.com/news/102852522.html"/>
        <updated>2025-10-03T06:58:30.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[国际金价续创历史新高
   
这个国庆假期，国际金价继续上攻，COMEX黄金期货冲破3900美元大关，续创历史新高。
乘金价上行之势，紫金矿业（601899.SH）海外黄金资产分拆上市于9月30日挂牌交易。10月3日，紫金黄金国际（02259.HK）股价继续上扬，收报139.6港元/股，总市值3660亿港元。
根据此前发布的招股书，IPO后，紫金矿业持有紫金黄金国际86.7%股权，主营该公司所有境外黄金矿山资产的开采、精炼及销售等业务。
分拆8座海外金矿，年入30亿美元
早在2003年，紫金矿业登陆港股，2008年在A股上交所上市。2025年9月30日，陈景河的第三个IPO落地。
目前紫金矿业在A股市值超过7800亿，成为涵盖金、铜、锂、锌等金属的全球矿业公司。
此次分拆上市的紫金黄金国际则被看作“纯黄金股”。
根据招股书，紫金黄金国际持有8座境外金矿，据弗若斯特沙利文统计，截至2024年底，紫金黄金国际的黄金储量及黄金产量综合计算分别位居全球第九及第十一。
截至今年上半年，紫金黄金国际的矿山的总矿产资源量约11.76亿吨，平均金品位为每吨1.5克，金金属矿产资源量为1768.4吨，黄金产量为20.4吨，母公司紫金矿业的黄金产量为41.19吨，占比接近50%。
收入方面，2022年至2024年度，该公司年营收由18.18亿美元增至29.9亿美元；净利润从2.9亿美元跃升至6.21亿美元；近三年毛利率先降后升，分别为34.1%、26.2%、37.9%。收入主要来自黄金销售，且持续贡献超过94%的收入，也因此黄金价格波动直接影响公司的经营业绩。
在金价狂飙背景下，此次IPO也迎来资金的看好。
紫金黄金国际引入29名基石投资者，合计认购约124亿港元，其中包括GIC、高瓴、贝莱德、高毅资产、富达基金、景林、中国太保、泰康人寿、IDG Breyer Fund、橡树资本、云锋投资、CPE River等。同时，因募资近250亿，紫金黄金国际也成为今年仅次于宁德时代的第二大港股IPO。
延续买买买，债务压力仍存
紫金黄金国际也延续了紫金矿业买买买的风格。
今年6月，紫金黄金国际斥资12亿美元买下哈萨克斯坦共和国Raygorodok金矿所有权。为此，紫金黄金国际拟向金融机构贷款，用于购买Raygorodok股份。
根据招股书披露的资产负债表，公司截至2025年上半年合计负债32.39亿美元、2022年~2024年分别为18.28亿美元、25.64亿美元和25.01亿美元，统计期内资产负债率持续超过43%。
持续的并购需要大量资金支撑，母公司紫金矿业在矿产收购方面动作频频，资产负债率在过去五年间也始终保持在55%以上，其中三年更是超过59%。
“当前地缘冲突不确定性强，收购海外矿山面临着诸多风险因素。”一位矿业分析师称，包括相关项目审批存在不确定性、项目成交受外部交割条件制约等。
紫金黄金国际也提到了需面对的地缘风险和被盗采风险。
在招股书中，该公司提到在多个国家经营金矿，包括哥伦比亚、澳大利亚、吉尔吉斯斯坦、圭亚那、苏里南及加纳等。使其面临一系列特定风险，这可能对公司业务、财务状况及经营业绩造成重大不利影响。
黄金股的黄金年
除了紫金矿业，年内赴港上市的黄金股表现都不错。
今年3月10日，赤峰黄金成功在港股上市。随后走出一波涨势，不到一个月触及股价历史高位35.9港元。截至10月3日发稿，股价为31.4港元，年内涨幅130%。
9月24日，山金国际（02297.HK）正式向港交所提交上市申请书，该公司目前已拥有6 座金矿与1座铅锌银多金属矿，2024 年收购纳米比亚osino 金矿，正式迈出海外并购步伐。
此外，去年底上市的黄金消费股老铺黄金（06181.HK）也持续上涨，股价从最初的40.5港元/股飙涨至目前的685港元。
金价方面，2025年黄金价格接连突破3300、3500、3800美元关口，不断刷新创历史高位。如今COMEX黄金期货价格最高触及3923美元/盎司，年内累计涨幅超过40%。
目前，市场依旧看好金价上行动能。诺安基金预计，黄金中长期上涨趋势不改，建议投资者逢调整逐步增加黄金配置比例。诺安基金预计，年内美联储利率决策主要取决于美国劳动力市场变化，通胀压力次之，美联储政策基调逐步转向鸽派，叠加央行增持、美元信用受到冲击等因素，金价或将持续受到支撑。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[IT之家 10 月 3 日消息，2025 国庆中秋假期出游高峰，除了高铁、飞机，不少人也选择自驾出行，有网友在媒体平台发文称，部分高速服务区充电桩已开始“叫号充电”。

据极目新闻 10 月 2 日报道，湖南高速新能源平台工作人员表示，今年国庆假期，他们在所辖各服务区都派了工作人员值守，一旦出现车辆排队充电情况，就会实际叫号。如在洞口、安江、桃陵等服务区，9 月 30 日晚到 10 月 1 日上午都实行了叫号服务。
湖南永州境内一服务区工作人员表示，充电高峰在 9 月 29 日晚上，高峰时会限制车辆充电至 80%，目前已经过了车流量高峰期，充电不需要排队，开过去就能直接充。
对这两天备受关注的“排队叫号充电”新闻，上述工作人员认为是好事，“排队叫号可以避免发生冲突。此前充电是自行排队，总会发生插队情况引发冲突，实施叫号后能够尽量规避矛盾。”
湖南高速服务区经营管理有限公司官方发布的信息显示，该公司国庆假期共在 30 对重点服务区、60 座充电站安排了运维人员驻点值守引导。同时在大流量服务区，为车主发放排队号码牌。
报道还称，位于雅安天全县的天全服务区，是川西 318 自驾旅行时常会经过的地方。雅康高速工作人员表示，该服务区人流量一直较大，如果想充电，建议寻找附近其他服务区，避免排队等待。
报道提到，国家电网客服人员则表示，节假日出行增加，新能源车辆充电需求也比较高，因此排队的人就会多一些。但一般来说，都是车主自觉进行排队充电，没有统一安排充电叫号。
IT之家另综合央视新闻消息，交通运输部路网中心预计 2025 国庆中秋 8 天假期里，全国高速公路日均流量将超过 6200 万辆。其中小客车日均流量约 5650 万辆，占总流量比例接近九成，自驾出行比例较高，同时新能源汽车假期日均约 1250 万辆，占日均总流量近 20%，与去年同期相比增长约 30%。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[IT之家 10 月 3 日消息，OPPO Find 系列产品负责人周意保今天在微博透露，Find X9 Pro 手机将搭载 0816 增强版马达，号称“同级别最大体积”，还做了多项针对性优化。

周意保表示，震动马达体积是硬件规格的基础，直接决定了震动的强度和质感，他们此前在 Find X8 Ultra 上已经采用了安卓阵营中体积最大的 0916 马达，而这次 Find X9 Pro 所搭载的马达也是“同级别最大体积”。
不过周意保认为，马达体积并不是决定震感体验的唯一因素，他们通过系统的人因研究发现，马达的实际震动体验与系统共振频率密切相关。为此他们在 Find X9 Pro 上重点优化，将共振频率控制在 130Hz 左右。

130Hz 频率更接近人机交互中的自然节奏，号称能“有效降低高频振动带来的‘尖锐刺儿感’，能保证绝佳的震动反馈”。
这名产品负责人还认为，有些厂商会一味地追求震动量，并没有意识到 130Hz 共振频率的重要性。他还认为，Find X9 Pro 的震动体验是“同级别最好”。
据IT之家此前援引周意保报道，OPPO Find X9 Pro 手机将成为行业首个“真 2 亿手机”，采用浮动光学镜组与 OPPO 独家的超晶态蓝玻璃，引入高端光学镜头同款的 AOA 主动光学校准技术，其综合 MTF 相比传统方案提升 15%。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[IT之家 10 月 3 日消息，据外媒 Autocar 今日报道，保时捷决定延长燃油版 718 Boxster 和 Cayman 的生命周期，并推出新的“顶级”车型，预计将搭载来自 911 的水平对置六缸发动机。

奥博穆将这一调整称为“战略重组”，意味着保时捷的电动化路线迎来重大转向。公司取消了原计划作为旗舰的大型纯电 SUV“K1”，同时决定让燃油版卡宴和 Panamera 至少继续生产到本世纪 30 年代。
保时捷还中止了大众集团 SSP “Sport”平台的研发。该平台原本计划支撑 K1、纯电 Panamera 和下一代 Taycan，然而被推迟到下一个十年才能问世。
保时捷因此将承担 18 亿欧元（IT之家注：现汇率约合 150.46 亿元人民币）的损失。奥博穆表示，高端纯电车型的需求正在下降，公司必须调整策略。
在 718 系列中，“顶级”车型意味着 Spyder RS 和 GT4 RS 会继续存在，并位于即将推出的纯电 718 之上。
为了弥补此次转向造成的 31 亿欧元（现汇率约合 259.13 亿元人民币）损失，保时捷正努力在 718 与 911 之间实现更多共通点，尤其是动力系统。两者本就共用 MMB 平台，当前的调整将进一步简化生产，降低采购成本，并带来更高的规模效益。
受欧 7 法规影响，718 的 2.0L 四缸发动机将在 2026 年底退场。未来的“顶级”718 将改用在 911 Carrera GTS 上首发的 T-Hybrid 系统，其六缸发动机比标准版 911 的双涡轮机型短 110mm，更适合 718 的车身结构。
这一做法几乎回到了最初 Boxster 的成功模式：用一台降功率的 911 发动机，匹配中置布局，提供更亲民的选择。
然而，欧盟 GSR2 法规几乎判定现有燃油 718 无法继续生产。即便存在“小规模系列”豁免，每年也仅限 1500 辆，而保时捷的销量显然远超这一数值。更现实的做法是投入资金，全面升级燃油 718，以符合 GSR2 的要求。
奥博穆强调，保时捷仍然不会放弃电动化。他指出，电动车正在吸引一个特定且不断扩大的客户群体。保时捷即将发布基于大众集团 800V PPE 平台打造的纯电卡宴，同时已在售纯电 Macan 和 Taycan。]]></content>

The first results could be “widespread distrust of countries that commit what can be called a crime,” Jacques Sapir, veteran economist and director of studies at the Paris-based School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences, told Sputnik.


Sapir singled out more consequences, including rapid flight of capital from Western countries, driven by a collapse in trust.

Distrust would extend to currencies in which the frozen Russian assets are denominated—the euro and dollar, according to the economist.

He suggested that Global South countries would gradually refuse to use these currencies—first in financial transactions, then in trade.


“The loss of credibility would cause a rapid split in financial spaces, and in particular in the debt market, whether public or private,” Sapir pointed out.






The economist said that for debtor nations like France, this would mean a sharp rise in interest rates, caused by an increased “risk premium.”


He added that the problem of the “immense US debt” would also come to the fore as credit agreements would become increasingly political, accelerating the breakup of global financial markets.






This could accelerate the creation of a more modern alternative to SWIFT, Sapir stressed, noting that potential use of frozen Russian state assets would further politicize international financial and economic relations.


“[…] Economic rationality is often hostage to ideological prejudices and political choices made under pressure from the US,” Sapir concluded.]]></content>

10 月一开局，OpenAI 甩出 Sora 2，标志着 AI 视频生成的「ChatGPT 时刻」来临。
另一边，谷歌并没有坐以待毙，下一代 Gemini 旗舰模型即将出世。
坊间传闻，Gemini 3.0 最晚下周上线。今天，谷歌内部研究人员在 X 上，频频发文暗示 ——BIG THINGS！

更值得一提的是，拿到内测资格的开发者们，已经发出一大波惊艳实测 demo。
Gemini 3.0 编程之王，实测惊艳
内部代码流出，Gemini 3.0「家族」目前有 Gemini 3.0 Pro、Gemini 3.0 Flash 两个版本。

在 ARC-AGI-2 上，开启思考模式的 Gemini 3.0，准确率超 20%。

在人类最后考试基准上，Gemini 3.0 拿下了 32.4% 最高分，性能碾压 GPT-5、Grok 4。

以下，我们汇总了全网实测案例，一睹为快。
@Chetaslua 实测后惊叹道，谷歌这次赢麻了！这绝对会是有史以来最强的前端和网页开发模型。

以经典的「小球六边形重力摩擦」测试为例，Gemini 3.0 Pro 能够一直做到，小球在六边形中的表现精准符合物理定律。
比如加速旋转、放大 / 缩小六边形、放大 / 缩小球体、加大阻力等，它都「接得住」。
还有模拟太阳系，Gemini 3.0 Pro 也是一绝。

Gemini 3.0 Pro 还能一键直出终端界面，网友称之为，它在前端将是一个「怪兽」级的存在。

生成 SVG 格式的图片，「鹈鹕骑自行车」测试 Gemini 3.0 Pro 一键通过。



▲ Prompt: Create code for an SVG of a monkey writing on a typewriter as nicely done as you can.
再来看一个和 Claude Sonnet 4.5 的对比，Gemini 3.0 Pro 生成的小狐狸在灯下拉琴，可与之一决高下。


不过，Gemini 3.0 Pro 却在六指手部视觉测试中失败了。

对于 Gemini 3.0 Flash，开发者盛赞其在解决一个具体问题 —— 旅行规划时，展现出的惊人速度和精准度。


虽未正式发布，但关于 Gemini 3.0 的编程表现，暗示着编码时代正在改变。
真是有点期待 Gemini 3.0 了。

The Cuban government has condemned the illegal incursion of US fighter jets into Venezuela’s airspace, calling the actions a threat to peace and stability in Latin America and the Caribbean, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla has said. 


"We condemn the illegal invasion of US warplanes into Venezuela’s flight information region. We warn that these actions pose a threat to peace, security and regional stability. Latin America and the Caribbean are a zone of peace," Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla stated. 

On Thursday, Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said that five combat aircraft, presumably F-35s, were detected by the Venezuelan air defense system in the country’s airspace. The minister added that the international airline pilots confirmed sightings of the jets off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast. Padrino called the actions "a provocation and a threat to national security" and warned of the risks of "miscalculation" in the event of aggression. 

On Thursday, the Semafor news outlet reported, citing a US administration source, that Washington has not ruled out the possibility of strikes on Venezuelan territory as part of its campaign against drug cartels.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[中国家电龙头加码投资泰国等东南亚地区，旨在复杂多变的贸易环境下，通过深化全球布局应对各种不确定性。
   

“萨瓦迪卡，来泰国啦！”近日，海尔集团高管在微信视频号中，透露了泰国春武里海尔空调智能工厂投产的情况。这里一年前动工，今年9月23日智慧互联工厂已投产。
同日，海信HHA智能制造工业园开工仪式在泰国安美德春武里工业园举行，将建成海信最大的海外工业园，项目分三期，一期投资47亿泰铢，超10亿元人民币。
不只海尔、海信，美的集团今年也进一步深化在泰国的供应链布局。而格力电器旗下的盾安环境在泰国的基地主要做制冷配件的生产和销售，目前在手订单充足。
中国机电产品进出口商会家电分会秘书长周南向第一财经记者分析说，从泰国出口空调至美国相比从中国直接出口目前仍有不小的税差，但关税变化的不确定性依然存在。中国与东盟已形成产业链协作，中国家电龙头加码投资泰国等东南亚地区，旨在复杂多变的贸易环境下，通过加大全球布局来应对各种不确定性。

打通通往全球市场的“快车道”
面对复杂的贸易环境，东南亚成为中国家电龙头企业加码布局的海外重点区域。而海尔、海信之所以选择泰国建设重点基地，是基于多方面综合考虑。
首先是泰国有产业基础，中泰关系良好。泰国目前是排在中国之后的全球第二大空调制造基地，尤其是其东部经济走廊，聚集了美的、海尔、海信、奥克斯等空调或零部件工厂。今年是中国与泰国建交50周年，双方加强合作，家电是重要领域。
其次是泰国受益于多个自贸协定，泰国出口的商品享受欧美等国家的普惠制待遇，泰国产品出口到东盟其他国家也很便利。泰国背靠近7亿人口的东南亚市场，依托其东部经济走廊，能快速响应东盟需求，打通通往全球市场的“快车道”。
海尔泰国智能空调工厂，总占地约32.4万平方米，规划建设多条智能化生产线和超大型仓储物流中心，覆盖空调全链条，规划年产能600万套，是海尔在东南亚最大的空调基地。该厂不仅面向东南亚市场，还具备直供北美、欧洲、日韩市场的能力，是海尔空调全球产能与出口枢纽。其产品包括家用柜机、挂机、窗机，商用水机、热泵，以及车用空调、集装箱恒温空调等。该厂还实现全流程数字化，支持大规模定制。
而海信早在2019年已计划在泰国东部建立空调工厂，两年后其泰国工厂首条自有产线生产的首台海信空调下线。2025年7月，海信HHA智能制造工业园奠基，计划2030年完成建设，年产能将达1200万台，年产值将达1000亿泰铢（约219.68亿元人民币）。一期项目投资47亿泰铢，将建设11万平方米的冰箱、冷柜、洗衣机工厂，年产能预计将达260万台，年产值将达80亿泰铢，为当地创造约1200个就业岗位。
根据产业在线数据，泰国作为全球第二大空调制造国，2025年上半年产能达865.5万台。此次海尔空调泰国基地新增600万套产能，与中国青岛形成两大全球供应中心，实现“东南亚需求本地造、欧美需求就近供”。
产业在线分析师龙飞向第一财经记者表示，中国企业在泰国的本地化发展呈现出“绿色化”与“智能化”的双重趋势。多家企业在新建生产基地中广泛应用环保制冷剂、数字孪生、AI质检和自动化物流等技术，致力于提高能效、降低碳排放并实现精细化管理。这不仅符合全球可持续发展的要求，也提升了产品在高端市场的竞争力。

泰国白色家电产业链还需完善
加码泰国等东南亚地区的投资布局，稳定对外国市场的出口订单，是重要的考虑之一。空调业资深人士、三友环境董事长肖友元向第一财经记者分析说，如果要规避外国的关税壁垒，需要满足泰国原产地的条件，而且从泰国去外国的成本增加不能超过15%，否则工厂将失去价值。从这个角度看，进一步完善泰国本地的产业链成为趋势。
目前，泰国与中国的产业链仍然有明显差距。截至2025年9月，中国空调行业年产能已突破3亿台，泰国同期空调年产能不到中国的十分之一。又如，海信集团去年营收超2143亿元人民币（下同），其中海外收入996亿元，其泰国HHA智能工业园2030年的规模预计约为去年其海外收入的五分之一强。业内人士向记者透露，泰国的综合生产成本仍高于中国，家电产业在泰国想降低生产成本，就需要扩大规模、完善上下游产业链。
据泰国安美德工业园的官方微信公众号，泰国投资促进委员会（BOI）已与美的集团合作，今年9月17日在曼谷举办美的集团采购日活动，旨在促进泰国本土零部件的采购，尤其支持泰国中小企业，融入日益壮大的全球家电行业供应链。
此次展会共有来自145家企业的约260家泰国零部件厂商参加，其中美的集团从中国带来了100多人的采购团队洽谈业务，同时还有来自泰国分包协会、PCB协会等40多家合作机构的团队。
美的集团自2016年起在泰国投资，最初通过收购东芝白电业务。自2020年起，美的在泰国加大投资，目前已在泰国有8家工厂、超10000名员工，其中包括200多名研发人员。美的在泰国有其在海外最大生产基地，包括其海外最大空调智能工厂，其泰国空调工厂今年还入选“灯塔工厂”。
在这次采购日活动上，美的解释了10个产品组70个关键零件的生产标准和供应商选择指南，包括电子零件（如电容器、PCB）、金属零件、结构和系统（如叶轮、活塞、曲轴、管道、阀门）、橡胶和塑料零件。此外，美的还与60家选定的泰国零件制造商进行业务匹配，预计将产生超15亿泰铢的零件销售额。
格力电器旗下的盾安环境在泰国已有制冷零部件工厂，目前在手订单充足。格力电器今年在泰国的业务，正式从代理模式，转变为自主经营。格力电器表示，将逐步完善海外智能制造基地布局。泰国等东南亚地区预计将是格力深化海外产销研一体化布局的重点区域。
周南建议，泰国等东南亚市场仍然面临贸易关税的变数，中国家电龙头企业的国际化布局是一个动态发展的过程，需要为各种变数做好相应的预案。]]></content>

Tech company Apple removed ICEBlock — the most popular app to track the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency — and similar apps from its App Store, it said on Thursday after it was contacted by US President Donald Trump's administration.
The ICEBlock app alerts users to ICE agents in the area, allowing them to evacuate migrants who may be arrested.
Curtailing illegal immigration has been one of the central domestic policies in Trump's second term at the White House. However, reports suggest that ICE agents, often in masks using unmarked vans, have also detained permanent US residents, visa holders and those involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy.

'Safety risks'
US broadcast channel Fox Business reported on the app's removal and cited US Attorney General Pam Bondi saying the Justice Department had contacted Apple to pull the app from the platform.
The US Justice Department and Trump's administration have said the apps endanger officers by increasing the risk of assault on ICE agents.
"ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed," Bondi said in her statement to Fox Business.
The criticism has increased after a shooting at an ICE facility in Texas in September killed two detainees and injured another.

Officials said the shooter was targeting ICE agents and was using similar apps in the days leading up to the attack.
"Based on information we've received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store," Apple said in an emailed statement.

 星展集团（DBS）股价今年强劲上涨，市值领先本地第二大银行华侨银行（OCBC）的幅度，扩大至有史以来最高水平。
星展股价今年来已上涨21%，市值增加约260亿元，与华侨银行的差距扩大到750亿元。分析师看好星展的股息派发能力和财富管理业务前景。
马来亚银行证券（Maybank Securities）新加坡部门主管侯查尼（Tareck Horchani）指出，星展的运营效率高于同业，并更注重回馈股东。他说：“尤其在财富管理、交易银行、现金管理和人工智能应用等领域，星展具备规模优势，明显领先竞争对手，这将支撑星展的估值溢价。”
在最新财报季，星展因贷款收入、交易收益及创纪录的资产管理规模强劲增长，超出市场预期，抵消了利率下滑带来的压力。星展也正加深财富管理战略。银行预计下月初公布业绩。
在新加坡三大银行中，星展获得最多投行分析师买入评级，同时预估股息收益率也在同业中最高，接近6%。摩根大通（JPMorgan）上月将星展评级从“中性”上调至“增持”，认为股息前景有望推动长期估值提升。
彭博数据显示，自第三季以来，分析师已将星展盈利预估上调约2%；相较之下，大华银行（UOB）和华侨银行的盈利预测分别下调3.6%和0.4%。星展与大华银行的市值差距同样扩大至历史新高。
截至星期五下午1时55分，星展涨0.04%至52.86元，华侨持平在16.76元，大华涨0.37%至35.2元。]]></content>

 新加坡政府投资公司首席投资官杨健明警告，人工智能初创投资正形成“炒作泡沫”，并提醒全球债市也可能面临风险。
彭博社报道，杨健明星期五（10月3日）在新加坡举行的米尔肯研究院亚洲峰会上说：“如果科技发展无法赶上市场定价所反映的高期望，就会形成泡沫。”
他说：“未来三到五年会出现高速的价值创造，但那些未能及时转型的企业，也将面临价值被侵蚀甚至消失的风险。”
他同时指出，疫情期间各国政府大幅增加借贷，如今面临财政风险。“问题在于，世界能否靠增长消化掉庞大的债务存量。”杨健明说，若政府不愿削减开支或增税，未来投资者可能会通过推高收益率迫使问题浮现，从而冲击全球市场并动摇货币信心。
杨健明说，GIC正在提高私人信贷投资的门槛，因为市场资金流入过多引发担忧。在中国市场，尽管经济转型需要多年时间，GIC仍维持投资，并看好一些估值较低、增长可持续的领域。他举例指出，GIC在紫金黄金国际于香港的首次公开售股中扮演了基石投资者角色。
同场的TPG公司总裁西西茨基（Todd Sisitsky）也表达对人工智能投资的担忧，称部分早期企业估值高达“每名员工约10亿美元（12亿9000万新元）”，“令人咋舌”。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[國際貨幣基金組織(IMF)指出，關稅持續影響下，全球通脹形勢將變得更複雜，憂慮下半年全球經濟將放緩。

國際貨幣金組織表示，上半年全球經濟增長保持穩定，在關稅的不確定性中表現韌性，但開始見到有放緩跡象，雖然部分關稅傳導至價格上漲，推動美國核心通脹上升，但企業至今承擔了大部分更高關稅，估計上半年美國通脹為百分之3.2，低於市場預期的百分之3.5。

相比之下，英國、澳洲和印度的通脹更高，預期分別達百分之4.5、百分之4.2及百分之6.1，主要受能源價格及供應鏈樽頸推動。

至於中國及部分亞洲國家的通脹則非常溫和。整體而言，關稅持續影響下，全球通脹形勢將變得更複雜。

對於美國政府停擺，基金組織正評估對經濟的潛在影響。

國際貨幣基金組織發言人科扎克說：「關於美國政府停擺的問題，我可以說的是，我們顯然正在密切關注事態發展。鑑於目前還處於初期階段，我們仍在評估政府停擺的潛在影響。當然，這種影響很大程度取決於政府停擺的時間持續多久和具體方式。我們當然希望能夠找到一個折衷方案，確保聯邦政府資金充足。」

基金組織認為，美國勞動市場疲弱，聯邦儲備局上月減息的做法合適，但美國通脹面臨上行風險，因此聯儲局議息時，必須密切關注新通脹數據。目前市場數據顯示，聯儲局本月底減息四分之一厘的機會，超過九成八。]]></content>

India's IndiGo airline will begin direct flights between Kolkata and Guangzhou from 26 October

3 October 2025, 06:24 BST




India and China will restart direct flights between the countries this month, India's foreign ministry has said, in another step towards ties being gradually normalised.
There have been no direct flights between the two countries since 2020, following deadly troop clashes on their shared Himalayan border.
But over the past year or so, Delhi and Beijing have been working towards re-building ties, including taking steps to de-escalate tensions at the border.
On Thursday, India's biggest budget airline IndiGo said, external that it would restart direct flights between the cities of Kolkata and Guangzhou from 26 October.


In a statement released on Thursday, India's foreign ministry said that the resumption of flights would "further facilitate people-to-people contact" between the two countries and contribute towards "gradual normalisation of bilateral exchanges".
India and China share an ill-defined border that is more than 3,440km (2,100 miles) long and have overlapping territorial claims.
In 2020, troops of the two countries clashed at the Galwan river valley, leaving at least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese soldiers dead.
It was the first fatal confrontation between the two sides since 1975 and led to a freezing of ties.
But over the past year or so, Beijing and Delhi have been taking steps to gradually re-rebuild the frayed relationship.
High-ranking officials from the two sides have held several rounds of talks and meetings.


China and India pledge to be 'partners not rivals'


In October last year, India and China agreed on patrolling arrangements to de-escalate tensions along the disputed Himalayan border.
This year, China began allowing Indian pilgrims to visit some places of religious importance in what it calls the Tibet Autonomous Region while India restarted visa services to Chinese tourists and agreed to resume talks to open border trade through designated passes.
India's souring relationship with the US over President Donald Trump's punishing tariffs has also provided an impetus to Delhi-Beijing ties.
In August, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Delhi, where he said that India and China should see each other as "partners" rather than "adversaries".
Later the same month, Chinese ambassador to India Xu Feihong called the US a "bully" for imposing steep tariffs on India and other countries.
In August, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China for the first time in seven years for the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO), a defence summit. He also met Chinese President Xi Jinping at the sidelines of the summit, and the two re-iterated their commitment towards normalising India-China ties.

 为满足国人对拥有住房的渴望，政府计划在2025年至2027年期间，通过政府售地计划，推出超过2万5000个私宅单位，在全岛提供多样化的住房选择。此外，政府也会推出约5万5000个预购组屋单位。
总理公署部长兼财政部和国家发展部第二部长英兰妮（Indranee Rajah）星期五（10月3日）在新加坡产业发展商公会（REDAS）举办的中秋午宴上发表讲话时，透露这一消息。
根据政府今年6月宣布的2025年发展总蓝图，我国接下来将兴建至少8万个公共和私人住宅单位，包括新开发的纽顿和乌节巴德申共6000个私宅单位。
另外，政府在政府售地计划保持高水平的私宅供应。例如今年下半年正选名单地段，将供应超过4700个私宅单位，使今年全年正选地段的私宅总供应量接近1万个单位，较2021年至2023年间的正选名单年均供应量高出约50%。
英兰妮也强调发展商公会与政府在塑造新加坡城市景观方面的紧密合作，并概述提升建筑环境行业，实现更可持续和繁荣未来的关键举措。
她说，政府推出的2025年发展总蓝图草案，提出接下来10年至15年的新加坡城市愿景。她呼吁发展商公会继续与政府紧密合作，共同推进这些可彻底改变新加坡城市景观的新项目，如三巴旺船厂、克兰芝前新加坡赛马场，以及巴耶利峇空军基地等。
“这些重大开发项目将创建融合住宅、便利设施和绿色空间的新区域，同时推动经济增长，为新加坡人创造优质就业和机会。”
政府此前也指出，三巴旺船厂、克兰芝前新加坡赛马场，以及巴耶利峇空军基地等地将重新发展成为住宅区，其中克兰芝地区预计可建共1万4000个住宅单位，巴耶利峇空军基地2030年搬迁后可建约15万个住宅单位，至于三巴旺船厂住宅规划仍在研究中。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[There is still a wide gap between the former East and West Germany, even amongst young people who have only ever lived in a unified country. The new commissioner for eastern Germany attempts to explain why.
    October 3, 1990: Germany celebrated its reunification  Image: Zentralbild/dpa/picture alliance   
Elisabeth Kaiser is from Gera, in the eastern state of Thuringia. When the federal commissioner for eastern Germany was born in 1987, Germany was still divided. Two years later, the Berlin Wall fell, and on October 3, 1990, the communist GDR became history.
"I did not consciously experience the period of reunification, but the stories of my parents and grandparents have shaped me," Kaiser wrote in an annual report presented in Berlin just in time for the 35th anniversary of German Unity Day. For the 38-year-old member of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), this is a first, as she has only been in office since May 2025, when the new federal government was formed.
In her report, the political scientist focuses on how younger people are experiencing a Germany that has been united for 35 years. Yet the title she gave it hints at the gap between the former West and East: "Growing up in unity?"
Formally, the answer is "yes," because there is now only one German nation.
"We children of the late 1980s and 1990s are the first generation to have been socialized in a unified Germany," Kaiser writes in the report's foreword. "Nevertheless, for young people growing up there, 'the East' is still much more than a compass point. It is a space that shapes identities and influences lives," she stressed.

East German identity 
Kaiser, who studied at the University of Potsdam in the eastern state of Brandenburg, sees differences between herself and younger people from former West Germany.


"Many young people... cannot relate to the label 'West German' — especially if they live on the coast or near the Alps. In contrast, young eastern Germans identify themselves as Ossis far more often," she wrote, using a slang term for people from the former East.
Kaiser believes there are good reasons for this. Even though young Germans have all been grown up in the same country for three and a half decades, the conditions of their upbringing still differ in important ways.
"This is especially true outside the eastern German cities," she said.

How much did the German reunification cost?

Lower incomes, more welfare
In her report, Kaiser references a study on equality between the former East and West. It shows that in small towns and rural regions, public transportation and medical facilities are no longer comprehensively guaranteed in eastern states. In addition, people earn below-average incomes and are more likely to be dependent on social benefits.
"Wealth is also lower in the east than in the west," Kaiser added.
"This shapes the lives of many eastern Germans well into adulthood," she wrote, because they are less likely to be able to rely on their parents for financial support throughout their lives.
In addition, the aging of the population in rural regions of eastern Germany is more pronounced than in western areas. The proportion of young people is well below the national average.  

3 reasons the past still shapes eastern Germany today

Rich West, poor East 
When presenting her report, Kaiser elaborated on this aspect: "To this day, young people in the east are disadvantaged because wealth is mainly passed on through inheritance," which most east Germans cannot expect.
The figures published by the Federal Statistical Office for 2024 underline this: The tax offices in western states reported more than €106 billion ($124.5 billion) in inherited or gifted wealth. In the east, including Berlin, the figure was less than seven billion. That amounts to almost four times more in the west per capita. Kaiser finds this problematic and believes that a serious debate over changes to inheritance laws may be warranted.
One idea that has been floated is the "inheritance for everyone" proposal first put forward by the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) several years ago. This would see all young people in Germany receive an "inheritance" of €20,000 to finance education, start a business or invest in real estate. It would be financed by taxes on larger inheritances.
However, the topic is still unpopular with a lot of conservatives, including some in Chancellor Friedrich Merz's  Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
In the end, Kaiser's assessment is a mixed bag. Eastern Germany has developed well in many areas, the economy has grown, there is a vibrant start-up scene, and the region is a pioneer in the expansion of renewable energies.
But in the long run, all this will not be enough toclose the gap with the west. And this is likely to become even more difficult to change in the future due to the aging population in the east and the exodus of many young people to the west.
While Berlin's population has not decreased, the east has lost two million people since reunification in 1990 — a decline of 16%. Currently, the five eastern German states still have just under 12.5 million inhabitants.
During the same period, the population in western Germany grew by 10%, to almost 68 million people.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[对13人分别以重大劳动安全事故罪和工程重大安全事故罪依法判处刑罚。
   
记者从山西省吕梁市离石区人民法院获悉，2025年9月29日，山西省吕梁市离石区人民法院依法对吕梁永聚煤业有限公司联建楼“11·16”重大火灾事故涉及的韩文明等10人重大劳动安全事故案和陈瑞强等3人工程重大安全事故案公开一审宣判，对永聚煤业有限公司（以下简称永聚煤业）负责人韩文明、长治市陈熙吊篮开发有限公司（以下简称陈熙公司）负责人陈瑞强等13人，分别以重大劳动安全事故罪和工程重大安全事故罪依法判处刑罚。
经审理查明，2013年和2019年，永聚煤业三次向陈熙公司购置吊篮，由陈熙公司在永聚煤业联建楼二层浴室安装调试后交付使用。2023年11月16日6时30分许，永聚煤业联建楼二层浴室发生火灾，造成26人死亡、38人受伤，过火面积约900平方米，直接经济损失4990.26万元。
经调查认定，该火灾是一起因企业安全主体责任不落实，超限额加装电动吊篮、违规敷设吊篮供电线路，违规在井口浴室存放矿灯、氧气自救器、自喷漆等助燃物品，安全管理混乱，吊篮供电线路短路引燃吊篮内可燃物，初期火灾处置不力等导致的生产安全责任事故。事故发生后，永聚煤业对事故遇难者家属和伤者进行了赔偿。
法院认为，被告人韩文明等10人作为永聚煤业及其上级单位直接负责的主管人员和其他直接责任人员，履职不力，安全生产设施、安全生产条件不符合国家规定，致使发生重大安全事故，其行为均已构成重大劳动安全事故罪；被告人陈瑞强等3人作为涉案联建楼浴室吊篮施工单位的直接责任人员，违反国家规定，降低工程质量标准，造成重大安全事故，其行为均已构成工程重大安全事故罪。根据各被告人犯罪的事实、性质、情节、造成的危害后果等，依法对韩文明等10人分别判处四年六个月至一年三个月不等有期徒刑；对陈瑞强等3人分别判处三年三个月至二年三个月不等有期徒刑，并处罚金。对其中4名符合缓刑条件的被告人依法适用缓刑。
案件审判过程中，法庭依法保障了被告人的各项诉讼权利。宣判后，被告人韩文明等10人当庭表示认罪服判、不上诉。人大代表、政协委员和部分被告人亲属旁听了案件宣判。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[委內瑞拉偵測到多架美軍戰鬥機，在其海岸附近飛行，形容是挑釁。美國總統特朗普稱，美國正處於「非國際性武裝衝突」之中。

委內瑞拉國防部長洛佩斯周四表示，位於北部沿海的邁克蒂亞，飛行訊息區內的綜合防空系統，偵測到五架以上的美軍戰機。

委內瑞拉國防部長洛佩斯說：「這些飛機在我們的勢力範圍附近，委內瑞拉海岸附近的加勒比海飛行，是粗魯的，是一種挑釁，是對國家安全的威脅。」

洛佩斯表示，委內瑞拉軍方正在監視美軍在加勒比海的部署，並強調這些來自美國的威脅，不會恐嚇到委內瑞拉的政府和民眾。

美國早前以打擊拉美毒販為理由，在委內瑞拉附近的加勒比海打擊3艘「運毒船」，打死多名船上人員，導致委內瑞拉與美國關係進一步惡化。

美國總統特朗普據報向國會提交文件，解釋相關行動的法律依據，特朗普表示，販毒集團是恐怖組織，其成員是「非法戰鬥人員」，形容美國正與販毒集團處於「非國際性武裝衝突」中。白宮指這些跨國販毒集團，持續對西半球的安全構成威脅。

早前有報道指，美國可能會在未來幾星期，打擊委內瑞拉境內的販毒集團。

委內瑞拉總統馬杜羅，為應對來自美國的潛在威脅，已經簽署「外部動盪令」。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[新一份《施政報告》提出，加強打擊非法勞工，有立法會議員關注當局有何實質措施打擊黑工。

保安局局長鄧炳強出席立法會保安事務委員會時指，當局今年首8個月進行逾1.2萬次反黑工行動，檢控756名黑工及127名僱主。

他又指入境處推出舉報非法勞工專線，兩周已接獲近百個舉報。有立法會議員關注當局有何實質措施打擊黑工。

選舉委員會界別議員周文港說：「我認為需要加強阻嚇力。因為黑工沒保險、而且賠償沒上限，這方面是否可以做多些？」

保安局局長鄧炳強稱：「例如近期有網約車或外賣平台，都牽涉其他不同政策局及部門一同打擊，所以成立了跨部門組別，這組別不單止是交換情報，例如在執法上發現有漏洞，例如登記網約車司機，可以透過運輸及物流局叫相關業界，做好人面辨識等方式處理(黑工問題)，所以合作很重要。」

亦有議員關注「銳眼計劃」，除了增加閉路電視鏡頭覆蓋全港，可否加入人面識別技術。

經民聯選舉委員會界別議員陸瀚民說：「在鏡頭中、技術上是否可以加裝人面識別技術，時間表是怎樣？」

鄧炳強指：「這個科技日後會自然地應用在人上，例如有個犯人犯了法，如何追捕他？這個是必然需要做的，警隊正在研究，資源要用多少、要應用哪方面的科技，整個應用的優次，都是計劃中。當計劃詳盡落實就會與大家報告。」

他又表示，目前這些鏡頭已在人流管制及車牌識別等方面應用。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[内生驱动，行稳致远。
   
“任凭风浪起，稳坐钓鱼船。”回顾今年，全球经济复苏路径反复，全球市场敏感度激增，世界仿佛处于秩序与失序之间的摇摆点。地缘风险叠加、贸易摩擦频发，任何微小的扰动都可能被无限放大。9月，美联储重启降息并呈双重加速，进一步加大全球金融的不确定性。
然而，人工智能、清洁能源与数字金融的崛起，也为全球孕育新均衡提供了可能，世界因此展现出风险下行与机遇上行的双向张力。与之形成对比的是，中国经济展现出确定性路径。消费潜能释放中流砥柱，新质生产力崛起后劲十足，政策确定性支撑行稳致远。在全球动荡之中，中国以战略定力和制度优势稳住自身，也为世界提供稀缺的可预期力量。
全球经济：临界混沌，双向张力。2025年的世界经济，正站在临界混沌的岔路口。一方面，债务高企、贸易摩擦频发、地缘冲突加剧，叠加货币政策分化所引发的全球流动性变化，任何微小扰动都可能被放大为系统性风险，复苏路径因此反复摇摆。在此过程中，美国货币政策的转向尤为关键。今年9月，美联储时隔九个月重启降息，并呈现双重加速：其一是时间序列上的“加速”，未来九个月降息次数预计明显快于此前，货币政策进入更为积极的调整阶段；其二是规则序列上的“加速”，点阵图所反映的中枢利率预期，与市场对宽松的押注及政治压力之间形成显著落差，美联储可能跳出泰勒规则等常规参照，更加注重在政治干预与市场博弈中寻找平衡，从而推动降息节奏的加快。这些不确定性进一步放大了全球风险敞口。
另一方面，新质生产力的崛起正在积蓄力量。人工智能的广泛应用、清洁能源的加速转型、数字金融的制度创新，为全球经济突破瓶颈、跨越临界点提供了可能。其逻辑主要体现在三条主线。第一，在经济增长层面，AI短期以降本增效为主，长期则通过算法优化、流程再造以及知识外溢，从而显著提升全要素生产率。IMF与OECD的研究均表明，AI将持续贡献于全球增速和全要素生产率的提升。第二，在就业层面，AI并非单纯替代岗位，而是重塑任务结构与技能组合，既带来互补效应，也加速低技能岗位替代。第三，在资本市场层面，AI板块已成为资金关注的焦点，相关指数涨幅大幅跑赢大盘，未来随着盈利模式逐步清晰，也将推动新一轮全球资本配置。总的来看，2025年既有不确定性的下行风险，也有新范式的上行机遇，世界因此展现出双向张力。它既可能滑入更深层的不稳定，也可能孕育出更高阶的新均衡。
中国经济：内生驱动，行稳致远。当全球经济伫立在临界混沌的岔路口、徘徊于风险与机遇的双向张力之中，中国经济则展现出另一种确定性路径。以内需为基石，以创新为引擎，在动荡中保持稳健前行。一方面，消费潜能积厚成势。中国经济增长的内生潜力来自于庞大的消费市场。今年以来，财政、货币政策组合拳频频落地，既有立竿见影的短期刺激，也有固本培元的长期改革。更为关键的是，社会保障制度的逐步完善，不仅降低了居民的预防性储蓄动机，还增强了其对未来收入的稳定预期。经济学的动态博弈模型揭示，若政府能够在初期施以强有力的刺激，并保持政策的一致性和可信度，就能有效打破“低消费—低增长”的次优均衡，推动经济向“高消费—高增长”的帕累托最优均衡跃迁。现实中，这一逻辑正在中国得到验证。零售数据的回暖、服务消费的繁荣、线上线下融合的加快，都映射出消费潜能正被不断释放。消费潜能的释放，使得中国经济更有底气抵御外部环境的冲击。它不仅是居民生活质量提升的真实写照，更是宏观经济增长动力的内在保障。国庆假期的繁荣消费场景，正是这种潜能的生动注解。
另一方面，新质生产力厚积薄发。如果说消费是中国经济的基石，那么新质生产力就是驱动未来的引擎。人工智能与数字经济的深度融合，使中国产业链加速升级。无论是智能制造、绿色能源，还是智慧医疗、金融科技，创新正从单点突破走向全面开花。算力的持续扩容、场景的快速落地、资本的持续涌入，使得推陈出新成为常态，而全球对比下的相对领先，则让中国在新一轮科技竞赛中独占鳌头。IDC数据显示，到2026年，中国的智能算力规模将达到2024年的两倍。这些数字背后，是中国在基础设施、人才储备与政策扶持上的厚积薄发。新质生产力不仅是经济增长的源头活水，更是构建长期竞争优势的关键。更重要的是，这一进程展现出强烈的外溢效应。新质生产力的崛起，不仅提升了国内产业链的韧性，也为全球经济提供新机遇。可以说，新质生产力的蓬勃发展，不仅让中国经济势如破竹，也为世界经济注入了信心与期待。
全球与中国：乱云飞渡，稳坐钓船。2025年的世界经济，正处在临界混沌的边缘。乱云飞渡之际，金融市场动荡频仍，地缘政治阴霾笼罩，但中国展现出稀缺的确定性特征。消费潜能释放中流砥柱，新质生产力崛起后劲十足，政策确定性行稳致远。这三重支撑，使中国经济具备了抵御外部风险的韧性，也构成了全球经济亟需的可预期力量。当全球经济处在秩序与失序的交界点，中国的长期战略与制度优势，或许是未来秩序最可靠的支点。正所谓“乱云飞渡仍从容”，中国在全球风雨中不仅为自身寻求发展，也为世界提供安定的坐标。

        <link href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/sudan/return-starvation-weapon"/>
        <updated>2025-10-03T04:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[In late August, two of the world’s leading food crisis assessments came to the same conclusion about what is happening in Gaza: “famine with reasonable evidence.” One was the UN-affiliated Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC); the other was the U.S.-based Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), a partnership of government agencies formerly under the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Both bodies use rigorous criteria to designate five progressive levels of food insecurity, with “famine” as the worst. In concluding that Gaza had reached level 5, the IPC further noted that since the crisis is “entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed.”
For months, the starvation of Gaza has seized international attention. But it is not the only war-induced famine unfolding in the world right now. In fact, it is not even the worst. In July 2024, the IPC concluded that “famine with reasonable evidence” was unfolding in war-torn Sudan, where large parts of the population have been cut off from food aid. Since then, the situation has only worsened. According to recent IPC estimates, some 800,000 Sudanese are now suffering full-blown famine and another eight million face what the IPC calls a level 4 food “emergency,” just one step below that threshold. And just below that, some 22 million people—an astounding half of the country’s total population—are contending with a level 3 food “crisis,” meaning they need aid in order to avoid becoming trapped in a doom loop of hunger and destitution. Current cease-fire proposals for both Sudan and Gaza—including the Trump administration’s new plan for Gaza unveiled on September 29—call for the reopening of humanitarian-aid channels as soon as the fighting stops. But for both populations, that may be too late. International humanitarian law dictates that essential aid should not be contingent on a cease-fire.
Famines under any circumstance have been comparatively rare since the late twentieth century. In recent decades, bigger and more skilled relief agencies and better early-warning systems have made it much easier to address hunger crises before they reach catastrophe. By the 2010s, an international consensus also seemed to have emerged against the starvation weapon. In 2018, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2417—which formally highlighted the link between armed conflict and hunger and condemned depriving civilians of food as a method of warfare. At the time, China, Russia, and the United States each preferred to denounce some regimes while being more lenient toward others. But they all voted for the principle that intentionally starving civilians was a war crime.
Just seven years later, that looks like a long-lost era, and not only because of the disastrous wars in Gaza and Sudan. In conflicts around the world, including in Ethiopia, Myanmar, and Ukraine, military forces and their backers have once again been weaponizing hunger. Yet leading global powers, distracted by volatile geopolitical shifts, new rivalries, and economic challenges at home, have done little to stop them. Meanwhile, the humanitarian-aid budgets of many wealthy countries have been drastically cut. The result is that more and more, belligerents can inflict mass starvation on vulnerable people with impunity.
HUNGERING THEM OUT
Withholding access to food is among the oldest weapons of war. In the twentieth century alone, it was used by all sides in both world wars, by colonial powers such as the French in Algeria and the British in Malaya, and by governments fighting separatists such as Nigeria in the 1960s and Ethiopia in the 1980s. In Sudan, successive regimes have for decades resorted to starvation campaigns to achieve military aims. In 1988, near the frontline of a previous civil war between the government and southern rebels, I witnessed unchecked starvation, with civilians dying at a rate almost 50 times the IPC famine threshold. The Sudanese brigadier in charge of that sector made no pretense about the government’s aim: “We’re hungering out the rebels,” he said. As the officer well knew, the men with the guns are always the last to go hungry—so his forces were creating a famine and emptying the land of civilians, at which point the insurgents would have to either surrender or starve.


The horrors of that war were a catalyst for change. The next year, under U.S. pressure, Khartoum allowed the UN to set up Operation Lifeline Sudan, the first time the UN crossed the battle lines to aid civilians in a rebel zone. It had an immediate impact. (Khartoum’s generals later complained that the intervention cost them victory and ultimately led to the secession of South Sudan.) Over the following decades, data on hunger crises also improved. During the 2010s, when manmade famines loomed in northern Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen, FEWS NET and the IPC—which had been set up in the 1980s and the early 2000s, respectively—allowed the world to track the progressive effects in real time, in color-coded maps. Humanitarians now had a blueprint for how to monitor and prevent starvation; they just needed high-level political backing to sweep away the roadblocks, open aid corridors, and demand cease-fires.

 The UN spoke softly about Russia’s starvation tactics in Mariupol.
With the UN Security Council’s passage of Resolution 2417, it looked like that resolve had finally crystallized. At the time, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley spoke passionately against the hunger weapon, singling out the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, which had freely used starvation sieges in Syria’s civil war. She refrained from publicly condemning Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for their blockade of Yemen, but U.S. officials worked quietly—and effectively—to ensure that aid was delivered. For the first time, both the United States and its global rivals appeared to be united in the determination to make starvation a war crime.
But that moment was short-lived. After Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine and blockade of Ukraine’s grain exports, international attention shifted to securing global food supplies. To get Russian President Vladimir Putin to consent to the UN’s Black Sea Grain Initiative, which aimed to allow Ukraine to safely export food, the UN had to speak softly about Moscow’s own use of starvation against Ukrainians, including the Russian army’s 85-day siege of the city of Mariupol. By this point, Ethiopia had already begun a war of starvation against the rebellious region of Tigray. When the IPC predicted famine, Addis Ababa simply responded by dismantling the country’s IPC working group, which, as the host government, it chaired. Famine denialism—keeping out journalists and suppressing humanitarian data—proved effective, and others have since followed that playbook. Tigray was a key test of Resolution 2417, but in the end, the Biden administration wasn’t ready to press for tough measures at the UN Security Council when Ethiopia failed to end the blockade. By 2023, the year the current wars in Sudan and Gaza started, starvation tactics were already making a comeback.
MUTUALLY ASSURED STARVATION
Sudan is today’s biggest and most intractable famine. Amid the vicious two-and-a-half-year civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a ruthless paramilitary organization led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, known as Hemedti, the numbers of hungry, destitute, and displaced are mounting every day. Because the warring parties restrict aid operations and many parts of the country are difficult to access, data is poor. But there’s no doubt that millions of civilians face truly desperate conditions, and even by conservative estimates, tens of thousands of them, most of them children, have already perished.
This tragedy is a direct result of actions taken by the warring parties on a population that is especially vulnerable to food weaponization. Before the current war began, more than two million people in Darfur were already living in camps and relied on World Food Program rations—more than half of which was funded by USAID. In the Nuba Mountains in the south of the country, there was an ongoing food emergency. Sudan’s urban dwellers were hungry, too: the Sudanese economy had all but collapsed, in part because of the loss of oil revenues following the independence of South Sudan, where most of the oil was located. In this precarious situation, RSF forces have systematically pillaged towns and villages and laid siege to El Fasher, the last SAF stronghold in Darfur, for more than 500 days. Trapped inside are some 250,000 people who are cut off from food. 
In turn, Burhan has exploited his status as the head of the UN-recognized government to restrict the flow of aid into Darfur and other RSF-controlled areas. Meanwhile, in the Nuba Mountains, a three-sided war is unfolding—between the RSF, SAF, and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army-North, which draws its support from the Nuba people, non-Arab farming communities who have long resisted the Arab-Muslim domination of the Sudanese state. Although the SPLA-N and RSF recently signed a political pact, people in encircled towns and ravaged villages continue to starve.

Without immediate intervention, it is almost certain that tens of thousands of Sudanese will die of hunger in the coming months. Yet this catastrophic situation has failed to trigger international action. This year, the UN scaled back its emergency appeal for Sudan, aiming to reach just two-thirds of the 30.9 million people in need. Even so, as of September, that bare-bones goal is barely 25 percent funded. Until January this year, USAID supported 1,400 community kitchens across Sudan, which were run by a network of local volunteers and were considered highly effective. But with the Trump administration’s gutting of USAID, 900 of the kitchens have been forced to closed. 
Meanwhile, the United Kingdom and the European Union, once aid superpowers, are tightening their purse strings, and wealthy Arab states, which have been meddling on both sides of the civil war, aren’t footing the bill. Even the UN Security Council has been unable to muster a strong response. In June 2024, the council passed, with Russia abstaining, a resolution ordering the RSF to allow aid into El Fasher. But in November, Moscow vetoed a second, more forceful resolution, saying it infringed on Sudanese sovereignty—a sign of how impunity has become the norm.
In mid-September, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, together with his counterparts in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates—collectively the Quad—announced a cease-fire plan that requires the two sides to immediately allow in humanitarian aid. It’s the right plan, and hopefully the other Quad members will set aside their differences and press the generals to implement it. But that’s only the first step. To actually stop the crisis, an international aid campaign must not only purchase and ship food and medicine to Sudan but also ensure that they are delivered to where they are most needed, a process that involves relief convoys traversing vast distances on poor roads with numerous roadblocks where local commanders run extortion rackets. For those already sucked into the vortex of famine, this slow timeline could be a death sentence.
MILITARIZED HUMANITARIANISM?
If Sudan is the world’s worst manmade hunger crisis, Gaza has become its most visible. For months, images of starving children and crowds of desperate people risking life and limb in a struggle for food have shocked the international public. In their August reports, the IPC and FEWS NET added hard data and expert judgment to those images. Even before Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza City began, conditions were dire for the nearly one million people remaining there. Fully 30 percent of them—more than the “famine” threshold of 20 percent—had no access to food at all. 
Because of extremely limited access, the IPC was unable to obtain its preferred metric for malnutrition—surveys of weight-to-height ratios of children under five. But using its second-best measure, surveying children’s mid-upper-arm circumference, it found a sixfold increase in malnutrition between early June and later July—the kind of exponential spike that occurs when a population is spiraling into famine. By August, reported deaths from starvation were also mounting, and the IPC inferred, in line with its data from previous crises, that these numbers are a small fraction of the overall hunger toll, with many more perishing from the ravages of disease on malnourished bodies and low rates of survival after surgery because wounds need nutrition to heal.
Beyond pointing out that the famine is manmade, neither the IPC nor FEWS NET allocates blame. But the causes have been plain for the world to see. In early March, Israel began a total blockade of Gaza and did not allow food into the territory for 11 weeks. And when Israel, under enormous pressure, finally allowed some aid to resume, it insisted that aid would henceforth be distributed not by the UN and long-established humanitarian nongovernmental organizations, but by a new entity, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, under the supervision of the Israel Defense Forces. 
The switch of aid delivery to the inexperienced GHF, at precisely the moment when Gaza’s population was plunging into famine, was disastrous. Instead of the 400 or so centers run by the UN and its partners, the GHF has just four locations, three of them in the far south and one in the center of Gaza—and none at all in Gaza City or the north. As has been widely reported, aid distribution from these sites has been plagued by violence, with more than 1,000 people shot and killed by IDF soldiers and private security contractors. The GHF cannot say who has eaten, sold, or hoarded the food boxes it is distributing. Quite possibly, substantial amounts have been grabbed by various criminal gangs or by Hamas itself—another count of GHF’s lethal incompetence.
Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu has tried to dismiss the pictures of starving children as “fake” and claimed falsely that the IPC has lowered its thresholds for famine. The IPC has responded with detailed technical explanations of its methods, in line with its well-established protocols. (Notably, Israel was quiet about what transpired last May, when FEWS NET reported that northern Gaza was in famine, and the IPC adjudged that the evidence didn’t yet warrant the finding.) If Israel wanted to clear its name, it could permit better humanitarian data gathering—and indeed, allow international journalists to enter Gaza. But it has not. Aid practitioners know what’s needed to reverse the Gaza famine, and because the area is small and accessible, they could make it happen very quickly. But in order to do so, external powers, and particularly the United States, must force Israel to allow the UN and humanitarian agencies to do their job, unhindered and at scale.



 Essential aid should not be contingent on a cease fire.
The United States has the power to turn this crisis around. In March 2024, the Biden administration pressured Israel to allow in more aid, and the crisis was briefly ameliorated. In January 2025, the incoming Trump administration insisted on a cease-fire, and Israel concurred. In early August, responding to international outrage, Israel allowed more food in, and the exponential increase in malnutrition rates charted by the IPC flattened. And now, U.S. President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza promises “full aid” to begin through the UN and humanitarian agencies when Israel and Hamas accept the agreement. That could end starvation quickly. In the meantime, if Netanyahu’s Operation Gideon’s Chariots II forces the evacuation of Gaza City, that will mean the closure of 11 of Gaza’s 18 remaining hospitals and make it impossible to save the most malnourished children. Every day counts.
For aid workers, the urgency of needs has created a larger dilemma. With few other options, senior UN officials reluctantly began talking with the GHF, exploring whether collaboration might be possible. Established humanitarians condemned this, arguing that the GHF doesn’t adhere to core humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, and independence. To a degree, these shortcomings should not be disqualifying: after all, an occupying power—such as Israel in Gaza—has legal obligations to provide aid, but it clearly isn’t neutral or independent. 
But ending mass starvation requires more than handing out boxes of food. It also must reverse the dehumanizing effects. In such a crisis, people are so gripped by hunger that they may transgress social norms—scavenging in garbage heaps, eating animal fodder, and stealing food or hiding it from their neighbors. Survivors often remember famines as when they lived like animals and may be scarred by shame and humiliation. Thus far, the GHF has failed the test of humanity because it fails to treat Palestinians as dignified human beings. The foundation’s basic rations might keep people alive but destroy their dignity in doing so.
DISARMING THE WEAPON
Today’s surge in starvation crimes may portend even worse in the future. Observing the lack of accountability in Tigray, Mariupol, El Fasher, and now Gaza City, autocrats and warlords in any of a dozen of the world’s hot spots may well seize the chance to employ this terrible weapon. Danger spots include a looming new war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, escalating conflicts in the West African Sahel, Myanmar’s ongoing campaign to destroy the country’s Rohingya minority, and Venezuela’s relentless food crisis.
Paradoxically, this trend is occurring even as international bodies have finally begun to condemn weaponized starvation. Eighteen months ago, in the case brought by South Africa against Israel, the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel should immediately provide a full spectrum of humanitarian relief and essential services, at scale and unhindered. Aharon Barak, the Israeli judge nominated to sit on the court, voted for the measure, making it unanimous. Israel hasn’t complied, a failing that increases the risk that the ICJ will in due course find that the Israeli government hasn’t met its duty to prevent genocide. In November 2024, the International Criminal Court for the first time cited starvation crimes in announcing international arrest warrants against Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, giving a high profile to the issue. On Sudan, UN Security Council Resolution 2736, of June 2024, still stands, demanding humanitarian aid and protection of civilians in the famine zone—but has never been enforced. Failing to enforce these decisions risks making a mockery of them.
In a world with apparently insoluble problems, preventing famine is one of the easier ones. Sufficient humanitarian funding is one step—$85 billion would meet the UN’s overall target for this year. That’s tiny compared with current spending on arms or the development of artificial intelligence. And those funds won’t be needed next year if agreed measures against starvation crimes are enforced. States can legitimately fight in self-defense, but the rules of war must be obeyed. The humanitarian tent can be expanded to include new organizations, but they must be made to comply with rigorous professional standards and conform to the principle of humanity.
The global consensus against the starvation weapon took decades to achieve. Now, international apathy risks letting it collapse at the moment it is most needed. Political solutions in Sudan and between Israel and Palestine may be hard to find, but keeping people from starving is perfectly feasible. It should be something on which all can agree.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[When armed factions led by the group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham overthrew Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad last December, many observers believed that Russia’s days in Syria were numbered. For decades, Moscow had nurtured close ties with the Assad family; less than a year ago, it bombed areas controlled by HTS. As the head of HTS, Ahmed al-Shara, took the reins in Damascus, The Economist warned that Russia’s military presence in the country was “hanging by a thread.” Russians worried, too. Shortly after Assad’s fall, Russian newspapers bemoaned the loss of a key ally in the Middle East, and military bloggers panicked over the future of Russia’s bases and outposts in the country.
Since then, however, Russia has defied expectations, holding on to its main bases on Syria’s coast—the Tartus naval facility and the Hmeimim airbase—and even entrenching itself in the country’s northeast. Russian diplomats moved quickly to engage the new rulers in Damascus, benefiting from Syrians’ perception that Russia is a great power and Shara’s desire to build positive relations with all external governments. Syria’s new leaders have, in turn, taken a constructive tone with Moscow, hoping for Russian energy, grain, friendly votes at the UN, and possibly, arms. By engaging Russia, Shara’s government also seeks to deter former Assad loyalists from rearing their heads, to warn Western states that Syria can look elsewhere for support on energy and defense, and perhaps even to limit Israeli military action within its borders.
Other interested parties want Russia to retain a modest presence in Syria, too: as different forces vie for clout, Russia has emerged as everyone’s favorite hedge. Both Israel and Turkey calculate that Russia’s influence could be leveraged to prevent the other from becoming too strong. And the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led militia, want Russia on their side in case the United States abandons them or Damascus tries to quash their hopes for autonomy.
The possibility that Russia could retain its foothold in Syria has caused some unease among European officials. In the spring, for instance, members of the European Parliament appealed to Syria’s new government to ban Russia’s military presence. Even if Moscow manages to preserve its bases, however, it will not be among the key players to shape Syria’s destiny. Bogged down in Ukraine, it simply lacks the financial and military resources to do so, and it will be eclipsed by the Arab Gulf states, Turkey, and, should they step up their engagement, the United States and European countries. U.S. and European leaders should accept that Russia will have a modest presence in Syria and avoid forcing Syria’s new government to pick between their help or Russia’s. The best way for Washington and its partners to prevent an ambitious Russian return is to lend concerted and patient support for Syria’s governance and economic recovery.
MY ENEMY’S FRIEND?
Russia’s ties with the Assad family go back to the Cold War, when Hafez al-Assad—Bashar’s father—solidified Syria’s place in the Soviet Union’s orbit. When Bashar parachuted into power in 2000, he felt no special affinity for Russia. He traveled to London and Paris before visiting Moscow. But he still maintained Syria’s friendly relations with the Kremlin. A decade later, when he responded to a peaceful uprising with a violent crackdown that escalated into civil war, Russia shielded his regime from UN Security Council sanctions and, eventually, launched a military intervention to prop him up.


By intervening, Russia gained enormous leverage over the trajectory of the war in Syria. In 2017, Russia deployed its military police to certain so-called de-escalation zones as part of an initiative also backed by Iran and Turkey. By maintaining a military presence in the country and, later, negotiating evacuation deals for rebels, Russia amassed valuable experience dealing with different armed groups. It settled local tensions, imposed security arrangements throughout the country, and cultivated relationships it could benefit from today. Russia also fortified its military footprint on NATO’s southern flank by expanding and upgrading the Tartus and Hmeimim facilities. Other countries intervening in Syria always had to consider Russia. The Gulf Arab states, which for a period supported different rebels; Iran and Hezbollah, which collaborated with Russia on the ground; and Israel, Turkey, and the United States all maintained deconfliction channels with the Russian military.
But when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Moscow became distracted and, in Syria, even complacent. The Kremlin thought it could maintain the Syrian status quo with limited effort and a reduced military presence. As Israel’s response to Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack widened, it escalated its attacks on targets linked to Iran in Syria. In response, Russia stepped up its patrols near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Moscow also intensified its bombardments of Idlib Province, a region controlled by anti-Assad rebels, to dissuade them from advancing. But these measures proved too little, too late. The rebels commenced their lightning offensive in late November 2024, and Russian forces largely stood aside, abandoning Assad to his fall.
NO PERMANENT ENEMIES
Many observers expected Assad’s ouster to bring Russia’s influence in Syria to an end. Within days, a spokesman for the new transitional government called on Russia to reconsider its presence in the country. But Russia wasted no time in courting Syria’s new rulers. Overnight, Russian TV stopped calling HTS a terrorist group. At the UN in early January 2025, Russian diplomats commended Syria’s transitional government for acting “competently.” Later that month, a Russian delegation traveled to Damascus for wide-ranging negotiations, including on the future status of Russia’s bases, investments into gas fields and ports, and—according to Syria’s state-owned news agency, SANA—a request that Russia pay reparations for supporting Assad and contribute to Syria’s reconstruction. Syria’s new leaders also asked the Russian government to extradite Assad, who had fled to Moscow. (Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely ever to do so—even now that Syrian authorities have issued a formal arrest warrant—because he wants to maintain a reputation for sticking by his authoritarian partners.)
Russia was especially keen to preserve access to its military bases. Over the years, Tartus and Hmeimim had become critical logistics hubs for Russian operations in Africa. In the immediate aftermath of Assad’s fall, Russia moved naval assets out of Tartus and consolidated its military aircraft, stationed at bases elsewhere in the country, at Hmeimim. In February, Syria’s new defense minister hinted that Russia would be allowed to keep its bases as long as their existence served Syria’s interests. “In politics, there are no permanent enemies,” he said.

 Russia has held on to its main bases on Syria’s coast.
Negotiating over its bases, Russia has reminded Syria of the support it can offer. In the spring, Russia shipped oil, diesel, and wheat to Syria. According to Reuters, the Russian company Goznak, which is under British, European Union, and U.S. sanctions and has long printed Syria’s currency, will issue the country’s new banknotes. With its veto on the UN Security Council, Russia could help remove the UN’s terrorist designations, which come with travel bans and asset freezes, on Shara and others close to him. Trained on Soviet and Russian systems, Syria’s new army may also hope for Russian weapons in the future, especially because much of its military capability has been decimated by Israeli strikes over the past year.
Many Syrians loathe Moscow for the countless bombs it dropped on Syrian cities in support of Assad. But Syrians never perceived Russia—as they did Iran—as sectarian or bent on changing the very fabric of their society. Russia was seen as a cynical, pragmatic, ruthless, great power with a long history in the Middle East. These perceptions—plus the fact that Maher al-Shara, Ahmed’s brother, has family ties to Russia—also help explain why Russia was not chased out of Syria outright.


Syria’s new rulers signaled early on that they were willing to build a new relationship with what they called the “second most powerful country in the world.” In July, a delegation of 20 Syrian officials including the foreign and defense ministers, the intelligence chief, and Maher al-Shara, who serves as secretary-general of the presidency, visited Russia. The two countries agreed to reactivate the Syrian-Russian Joint Committee to reevaluate Assad-era agreements and discuss economic cooperation. SANA heralded the visit as the beginning of a new era in relations.
QUESTIONABLE INTENTIONS
Syria’s new rulers have much to deal with in their effort to stabilize the country’s fractured domestic landscape. In March, Sunni militants killed over 1,000 people, many of them Alawite, on Syria’s coast. In July, hundreds of people died in clashes between Bedouin and Druze fighters in the country’s southwest. Israel has captured a buffer zone adjacent to the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights and regularly hit sites deep inside Syria, even as the two countries have begun to negotiate a security agreement.
In that context, Damascus’s bilateral engagement with Moscow serves several additional purposes. It sends a message to U.S. and European countries that Syria has other doors to knock on. Russian-Syrian diplomacy might disabuse any remaining Assad loyalists inside the country of the notion that they can play the Kremlin and Shara off each other. And Syria’s new rulers may hope that Putin will use his good relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get Israel to rein in its military activities on Syrian territory. As Syria’s new rulers strive for “zero problems” with foreign powers they seem to believe that it is useful to keep things amicable with the Kremlin.
Israel has its own reasons for wanting Russia to maintain a modest presence in Syria. Israel views Shara as a radical Islamist with questionable intentions and fears the growing role of Turkey—a country it accuses of anti-Semitism and spreading political Islam—in Syria and the wider region. Turkey wants a highly centralized Syria to quash the Syrian Kurds’ aspiration for autonomy. Israel, meanwhile, prefers a decentralized Syria—perhaps not as a matter of principle, but because Israel doesn’t trust the country’s current rulers and calculates that a fragmented Syria will be easier to handle. Israel’s leaders seem to think that Russia’s presence might help keep the country divided into zones of influence.
Turkey sees utility in a Russian presence in Syria for many of the same reasons. Ankara has registered Israel’s daring attacks and Saudi Arabia’s forays into Syria with apprehension. In the past, Riyadh has funded the SDF. Turkey hopes that it could turn to Russia to keep Israel at bay, support removing the UN Security Council’s terrorist designation on Shara, supply the weak Syrian military with weapons, and back Ankara’s position against Syrian Kurds. Such hopes are not without basis. When Assad was in power, Russia acquiesced to Turkish military operations against the SDF and jointly patrolled parts of northern Syria with Turkey.
Yet it is perhaps the vulnerable SDF that counts on Russia the most. The group is at risk of losing autonomy as Shara tries to consolidate power. In recent months, the SDF has increased its engagement with Russia with the aim of gaining an advantage over Turkey and the government in Damascus—and to have an additional ally in case the United States makes good on its promise to substantially reduce or even end its military presence in Syria’s northeast. Russia is already moving in. Through the spring and summer, Moscow deployed air defense systems and electronic warfare units—which would allow Russia to jam radio signals—to its base at Qamishli airport (located in a Kurdish-majority area), expanded housing for its troops, and fortified the base’s perimeter. Notwithstanding its cooperation with Turkey, Russia has in the past called for the protection of Kurdish rights and offered to mediate between Kurdish leaders and Syria’s central government. Israel, Turkey, and the SDF each seek to leverage Russia’s presence to accomplish goals that are fundamentally incompatible; given Russia’s shrewd maneuvering in the past, each one has some reason to hope that Moscow will end up supporting their parochial ambition.
DOWN BUT NOT OUT
For the foreseeable future, Syria will remain fragmented and weak, with external powers competing for sway over Damascus and for informal spheres of influence. In this fluid landscape, Russia will be one among many players, and far from the most important. As Shara prepares for his first visit to Russia, planned for October, it appears that Moscow has avoided expulsion from Syria. Yet more than anything, Syria now needs economic support, financial investment, and the lifting of all remaining international sanctions. To accomplish these aims, the Arab Gulf states, Turkey, the United States, and European countries will be key, not Russia. Even before it invaded Ukraine, Russia had little bandwidth to focus on Syria’s economic recovery and reconstruction; with its resources now sunk deep into Ukraine, it has even less to spare.
If Russia can hold on to its bases while continuing to prove its utility to the different forces that are competing to shape Syria’s future, it will still be quite a feat. Russia’s influence in Syria and the regional clout that came with it will never be what it was before Assad’s fall. But Russia will retain a military foothold on which it could build in the future—and from which it could continue to support its operations in the rest of the Middle East and Africa, especially once the war in Ukraine ends. Africa Corps, a Russian paramilitary outfit, is currently consolidating its presence in West Africa, a region the Kremlin views as important. Retaining its logistics nodes in Syria could help Russia expand there in the future.
Still, Western states should not penalize Syria’s new leaders for engaging Russia in the context of their pragmatic, multi-vector foreign policy. Soon after Assad fell, for example, the Dutch foreign minister, Caspar Veldkamp, suggested that the EU should consider lifting sanctions only if Syria expells Russia. “We want the Russians out,” he said. But Shara has no intention of returning the country into Russia’s orbit. In fact, he is maintaining a delicate balance between Russia and its adversaries. In September, Syria restored diplomatic ties with Ukraine. And it is unlikely that Russia’s bases will serve as a conduit for Iran to claw its way back into Syria. The Israeli military would likely nip such an effort in the bud.


As Syria’s authorities navigate formidable challenges, it only seems prudent for them not to antagonize Russia. Rather than panicking over Moscow’s maneuverings or conditioning their own support on Syria’s total break with Russia, U.S. and European leaders should focus on helping Syrians recover after a decade of civil war and a half century of despotism. The best way to ensure that Syria will not allow Russia to exploit its territory in the future is to build good relations with Damascus today.]]></content>

 得益于强劲的需求增长，新订单持续流入且商业信心明显改善，我国私营经济商业环境9月显著回温。但分析指出，潜在的成本压力也开始浮现，须警惕后续价格增速过快。
标普全球（S&P Global）星期五（10月3日）发布最新数据显示，新加坡9月私营经济领域的采购经理指数（PMI）大幅上升，从8月的51.2增至56.4，扩张速度创近一年新高，也是连续第八个月高于50。
PMI指数低于50意味着经济活动处于萎缩，高于50则是扩张。
报告指出，我国9月新订单与商业活动的增速都达到历史新高，主要得益于需求改善与营销力度加大，带动销售额加速提升。
此外，新业务的流入同时带动就业、采购活动与库存等恢复增长，供应链与产能压力也由此升高。其中，为应对需求量上升，我国一些在8月裁员的私营企业，到9月开始恢复招聘，也带动就业增长。
报告说，增加招聘未能显著缓解产能压力，9月积压订单量增速达到近一年最快水平，采购库存因此出现今年5月以来的首次上升。这是由于供应商订单积压过多，导致交货周期明显拉长，部分企业加大采购量以作为安全库存（safety stock）。
价格方面，由于采购价格和薪金双双上涨，9月整体投入成本继续上扬，投入价格通胀率创今年1月以来的最大涨幅。截至第三季末，投入成本和产出价格的通胀幅度都高于平均水平。
报告指出，企业强调投入材料、水电费和薪资成本上升，是投入成本增多的主要原因。一些企业选择将成本部分转移至客户，也让销售价格有所上扬。
标普全球市场财智经济副主任潘婧怡说，尽管美国的对等关税导致8月份经济增速放缓，但需求增长出现反弹，新加坡私营经济在第三季末大幅扩张。
“新增业务不仅推动经济活动升温，也让就业、采购和库存等指标出现恢复性增长。积压订单和未来产出指数等前瞻性数据，也显示第四季经济有望继续增长。但要密切关注，9月价格压力同样明显加剧，需防止成本压力给销售带来影响。”]]></content>

【编者按】很多曾经深入了解非洲的读者——包括长期在非洲居住、工作或旅行的人——会说：“非洲就是卡普希钦斯基在《太阳的阴影》中所描绘的样子。”
雷沙德·卡普希钦斯基是二十世纪深具影响力的作家和记者，曾经六次获得诺贝尔文学奖的提名。1958年，26岁的他被派往加纳报道该国的独立庆典，并成为波兰首位常驻非洲的记者。此后三十多年间，他在这片“大到难以描述”的大陆上游荡，往返于数十个国家和地区——不论是流血冲突、军事政变的现场，还是丛林中挣扎在生存线上的部落。在书中，他为读者呈现了一幅独一无二的非洲图景：那里有仿佛世界诞生之初的极致美景，也是无数部落、民族、文化和势力交织的汹涌之海。

旅程的终点到了。无论如何，是我一直在写的这段旅程的终点。现在是在回家的路上，在树荫下稍做休息。这棵树生长在一个名叫“阿福多”的村子里，村子位于埃塞俄比亚沃勒加省的青尼罗河附近。这是一棵高大壮硕、枝繁叶茂的杧果树，四季常青。在非洲的高原上、在一望无际的萨赫勒草原上旅行的人都会看到一幅不断重复、令人震惊的画面：被太阳炙烤的沙地上，覆盖着枯黄的野草的平原上，零星散落着几个干枯的灌木丛，每隔一段时间，就会出现一棵孤独的、枝繁叶茂的大树。它那一抹绿色是那么茂盛、新鲜、郁郁葱葱，在遥远的地平线上形成一个清晰浓重的圆点。尽管周围一丝风也没有，但它的叶子轻轻摆动，闪闪发亮。在这片如月球表面般毫无生气的景色中怎么会有一棵树呢？它为什么刚好就生长在这个地方呢？为什么只有一棵呢？它从哪里汲取养分？有时，我们开车要开很远一段路，才能遇到另一棵这样的树。
以前这里可能生长着许多树木，生长着一整片森林，但后来都被砍伐、烧毁了，只有这一棵杧果树保留了下来。附近的所有人都想拯救它，因为他们知道，它活着有多么重要。因为每一棵孤树周围都有一个村庄。所以，如果从远处看到这样一棵树，就可以放心地朝它走去，因为我们知道在那里会遇到人，能有点儿水喝，也许还会有点儿吃的。这些人救了这棵树，因为没有这棵树他们也无法活下去：在烈日下，人需要阴凉才能生存，而树就是这片阴凉的保管员和提供者。

如果村子里有老师，那么这棵树下就是教室。早上，全村的孩子都会跑来树下。这里不分年级，也不按年纪，谁想来都可以来。老师把一张打印在纸上的字母表贴在树干上，用树枝指着字母，孩子们盯着字母跟读。他们必须把这些字母记在脑子里，因为他们没有纸，也没有笔可以写字。
每当中午来临的时候，天空被晒得发白，所有能跑来树荫下的都躲在下面：孩子、老人，如果村里有牲畜，那些牛和羊也会来。要想熬过正午时分的炎热，在树下可比在自己的泥坯屋里待着好多了。屋子里又窄又闷，在树下地方宽敞些，还有凉风拂过的希望。
下午的时间是最重要的，村里的长者们那时会聚集在树下开会。杧果树下是唯一一个可以让他们聚在一起讨论的地方，因为村里没有更大的房间。人们非常积极，也十分乐于参加这种集会，非洲人的本性是集体主义的，他们渴望并需要参与集体生活中的一切。所有的决定都是集体做出的，纠纷和争吵需要共同解决，比如谁能得到多少耕地是要通过决议的。按照传统，任何决议都必须经过全体一致通过。如果有人有不同意见，占多数的人就会一直劝说他，直到他改变立场为止。这种情况有时会无休止地持续下去，因为这些讨论的一个特点就是没完没了。如果村里有人发生了争吵，树下的法庭不会追求真相，也不会决定哪一方占理，他们会承认双方都有道理，然后解决冲突，让双方达成和解。
当白天结束，夜幕降临，开会的人们就要暂停会议，各自散去。因为在黑暗中是不能进行讨论的，讨论的时候必须能看到说话人的脸，要看到他嘴里说的和他眼睛说的是否一致。
这时，妇女们聚集到树下，男人们和对一切都好奇的孩子们也会过来。如果他们有柴火，就会点起篝火；如果有水和薄荷，他们就会泡一杯浓浓的茶。最愉快的时光开始了，这也是我最喜欢的时光：讲述一天中发生的事情，这些故事是现实和想象的结合，有欢乐的，也有恐怖的。比如，今天早上有一个黑乎乎的、像疯了一样的动物在灌木丛中发出声音，那是什么？飞过山顶又消失了的奇怪的鸟是什么？孩子们把鼹鼠赶进了洞穴，然后他们挖开洞穴一看，鼹鼠不见了，它去哪儿了？随着故事的发展，人们开始回忆起很久很久以前，老人们告诉他们，的确有一只奇怪的鸟飞过后就不见了，还有人记得他的曾祖父告诉他，很久以前的确有一个黑乎乎的东西在灌木丛里发出很吵的声音。很久以前是多久以前呢？是记忆的极限。因为记忆的极限在这里就是历史的极限。在此之前，什么都没有。在此之前，什么都不存在。历史是可以被记住的东西。
除了北部的伊斯兰地区，在非洲都没有文字，这里的历史是口口相传的传说，是在杧果树下不经意间创造出的神话，在深邃的黑夜中，只能听到长者颤颤巍巍的声音在讲述，因为妇女和儿童都在静静地聆听。这个晚间时光之所以重要，是因为人们在这个时刻会思考自己是谁，从哪儿来，会意识到自己的特殊与不同，会确定自己的身份。这也是和祖先交流的时光，祖先们虽然已经离去，但一直在指引他们，保佑他们不受邪恶的伤害。
晚间树下的寂静只是表面现象。实际上，这片寂静中充满了各种不同的声音和响动。它们来自四面八方，来自高高的树枝之上，来自周围的灌木丛之中，来自地下，来自天上。在这种时候，我们最好待在一起，彼此靠近，我们感受到他人的存在，就可以感受到慰藉和勇气。非洲人每时每刻都感觉活在威胁之中。在这片大陆上，大自然呈现丑陋凶恶的形态，戴上复仇的恐怖面具，为人类设下陷阱和圈套，让人们生活在不确定、恐惧和惊慌之中。在这里，一切都被放大了好几倍，以肆无忌惮、歇斯底里的夸张形式出现。如果这里有暴风雨，雷电会撼动整颗星球，闪电会把天空撕成碎片；如果下起倾盆大雨，一道坚固的水墙从天而降，顷刻间就会把我们淹没，把我们砸入地下；如果出现干旱，那么一滴水也不会留下，我们会被渴死。这里没有任何东西可以缓和自然与人类的关系—没有妥协，没有中间状态，没有循序渐进。一直以来，只有斗争，战斗，生死之战。非洲人是一群从出生到死亡都身处前线的人，始终与这块大陆极其恶劣的自然环境作斗争，他能活着，能生存下来，就是他最大的胜利。
傍晚时分，我们一同坐在大树下，一个姑娘递给我一小杯茶。我听着这些人的讲述，他们坚毅的面庞闪着光芒，如同乌木雕刻而成，融入了静止的黑暗之中。我不太能听懂他们说的话，但他们的声音是那么的严肃认真。他们在说话的时候，认为自己是要对本民族的历史负责的。他们必须将历史完整保留并继续发展。没有任何人能说，“你们去读一读关于我们历史的书吧。”因为从没有人写过这样的历史书，根本不存在这样的书。除了现在在这里讲述的历史，其他历史都不存在。这里永远不会出现欧洲那种“科学历史”或“客观历史”，因为非洲的过去没有文件或记录，每一代人都是一边听着别人传授给他的版本，一边对这个版本进行修改，不断地改变、转变、修订和修饰它。但正是通过这种方式，历史摆脱了档案的沉重，摆脱了数据和日期的严格要求，历史在这里呈现出最纯粹的、如水晶般晶莹剔透的形式——神话。
在这些神话中，所有日期和对时间的机械衡量——日、月、年——都由其他表述方式来代替，比如“很久以前”“很久很久以前”或者“久到没有任何人记得以前”。一切都可以根据这些表述来安置并排列在时间的层次中。只不过，这种时间不是线性发展的，而是像我们的地球一样，匀速地旋转。在这样的时间观中是不存在“发展”的概念的，取而代之的是“持续”。非洲是永恒的持续。
天色渐晚，所有人纷纷回到自己的家中。夜晚开始了，夜晚是属于鬼魂的。比如，女巫是在哪里聚集呢？大家都知道，她们是在树枝上、藏在茂密的树叶后面召开她们的会议并进行讨论的。最好不要去打扰她们或者躲在树下，因为她们最讨厌别人偷听偷看。她们报复心非常强，一定会来报仇，给人类植入疾病、制造痛苦并传播死亡。
所以直到黎明，杧果树下都是空的。黎明时分，太阳和树影会同时出现在地面上。太阳把人们叫醒，人们会立即开始躲避它，寻求树荫的庇护。这很奇怪，但人类的生命的确依赖于像阴影这样短暂而脆弱的东西。这就是为什么提供阴翳的树不仅仅是一棵树，更是生命本身。如果雷电击中树顶、杧果树被烧毁，这里的人们就没有地方可以躲避阳光，也就没有地方可以聚集在一起。由于没法聚在一起，他们将无法决定任何事情、解决任何问题。但最重要的是，他们将无法讲述自己的故事，因为只有傍晚在树下聚会时，才能将这些故事口口相传。所以，他们很快就会失去对昨天的了解，失去对昨天的记忆。他们将成为一群没有过去的人，换句话说，他们将成为一群没有身份的人。他们将失去那些将他们团结在一起的东西，他们将散去，各奔东西，形单影只。但是孤独在非洲是不可能的，一个孤独的人一天也活不过去，他注定会死。因此，如果闪电击碎了一棵树，生活在树荫下的人们也会死去。不是有这样一句俗语吗：一个人不可能比他的影子活得更长。
除了树荫以外，第二重要的就是水了。
“水是一切，”生活在马里的多贡族智者奥格特美力曾经说，“土地从水中来，光从水中来，血液也从水中来。”
“沙漠会教会你一件事，”一位来自尼亚美的撒哈拉游商曾告诉我，“有一样东西会比女人更让你渴望和热爱，那就是水。”
树荫和水，这两样东西都是流动的、不确定的，都是出现之后不知道何时何地就会消失得无影无踪。
两种生活，两种境遇：每个第一次来到美国那种大超市或者无边无际的购物中心的人，都会被堆积在那里琳琅满目的商品所震惊，人们还会惊叹，在那里有人类发明和制造出来的一切物品，然后这些物品会被装车运走、打包堆好、摞高，让人觉得顾客不需要操心任何事情，有人之前已经帮他们把所有事情都想到了，现在一切都已经准备就绪，唾手可得。
而一个普通的非洲人的世界完全是另一副模样，这是一个贫穷的、最朴素的、最基本的世界，精简到只有几样物品：一件上衣、一个碗、一把粮食和一口水。这个世界的丰富性和多样性不是以物质、实体、看得见摸得着的形式来表达的，而是体现在它赋予最普通事物的象征价值和意义，那些事物太普通了，以至于外人难以理解并且不易察觉。比如，一根公鸡的羽毛可以成为黑暗中照亮道路的灯笼，一滴橄榄油可以成为抵挡子弹的盾牌。最微小的事物都具有象征性和形而上的意义，因为人们就是这么决定的，他们通过自己的选择，将事物提升到另一个维度、另一个更高的领域——进入超然的存在。
由于欧洲语言的某种贫乏性，非洲生活中的很大一个领域仍然没能被深入了解，甚至没有被接触到。如何形容黑暗、绿色、闷热的丛林深处？成百上千种的树木和灌木都叫什么名字？我知道一些植物的名字，比如“棕榈树”“猴面包树”“大戟属”，但这些树都不是长在丛林中的。那些长在乌班吉和伊图里、有十层楼高的参天大树叫什么？这里随处可见的、不断攻击和叮咬我们的各种昆虫叫什么？我们有时候可能会找到一个拉丁语学名，但这能向普通读者说明什么呢？这还仅仅是涉及植物学和动物学领域的。那么关于这些人的心理、信仰和思想的巨大领域呢？每一种欧洲语言都是丰富的，但只是在描述自己的文化、介绍自己的世界时才是如此。当某种欧洲语言试图进入另一种文化的领地并进行描述时，就会暴露出自身的局限性、欠发达程度以及在语义上的无能为力。
在前殖民时期——其实这也并非很久之前——非洲曾有一万多个小国、王国、民族联盟和联邦。伦敦大学历史学家罗纳德·奥利弗在其著作《非洲的经验》（The African Experience，1991年于纽约出版）中指出了一个常见的悖论：人们约定俗成地说欧洲殖民主义者瓜分了非洲，“但是怎么能用‘分’这个词呢？”奥利弗非常不解，“这明明是用火与剑进行的残酷统一！从一万多个缩减到了五十个！”
但是，这种马赛克，这幅由石子、骨头、贝壳、木块、铁片和树叶组成的闪闪发光的拼贴画，其多样的元素还是保留下来了。我们越是仔细凝视，就越能看到画中的组成元素在眼前交换位置、变化形状、改变颜色，形成一个多变的、丰富的、令人眼花缭乱的奇观。
几年前，我和朋友们在坦桑尼亚腹地的米库米国家公园一起过平安夜。那天晚上很暖和，晴朗无风。在丛林中的一片空地上，在开阔的天空下，摆着几张桌子。桌上有炸鱼、米饭、西红柿和当地的自酿啤酒。我们点燃了蜡烛、灯笼和油灯。气氛轻松愉悦。有笑话，有笑声，还讲了很多故事，在非洲，这样的场合总是如此。那天一起过节的有坦桑尼亚政府的部长、大使、将军以及氏族首领们。凌晨十二点已经过了。我突然感觉到，一个厚重的巨大黑影在灯火通明的桌子后面摇曳着，发出咕咚咕咚的声音。没过多久，这个声音变成了轰隆巨响，而且很快就出现在我们背后，在深沉的黑夜中，出现了一头大象的身影。我不知道，你们之中是否曾经有人和大象四目相对，我说的不是在动物园或者马戏团，而是在非洲的灌木丛中，在这里，大象是世界上最危险的霸主。人们看到大象会吓得魂飞魄散。这是一只离群的孤象，这种大象通常是一个狂躁的袭击者，它会冲向村庄，踏平泥坯屋，杀死人和牲畜。
大象真的非常大，目光锐利，一言不发。我们不知道它硕大的脑袋里面在想什么，不知道它下一秒会做什么。它站了一会儿，然后开始在桌子中间走动。桌旁一片死寂，所有人都吓呆了，一动都不敢动。你不能跑，因为一跑会惹怒大象。而且它跑得很快，没有人能从大象面前跑掉。但如果就这么一动不动地坐着，你就暴露在它的正面攻击之下，这个庞然大物的腿随时可能把我们撵成肉饼。
大象继续溜达着，一会儿看看摆满食物的桌子，一会儿看看油灯，一会儿又看看忧心忡忡的人们。从它的动作看得出，它在犹豫，一直无法做出一个决定。就这样一直持续了很久，久到看不到尽头，仿佛一切静止在冰封的永恒中。我在某个时刻捕捉到了它的目光。它认真严肃地看着我们，眼神中有一种深刻的、不可动摇的阴郁。
最后，大象绕着我们的桌子和空地走了几圈之后，丢下我们走开了，消失在黑暗之中。当重物砸地的轰隆声停止后，黑暗中一片寂静，一个坐在旁边的坦桑尼亚人问我：“你看到了吗？”“看到了，”我仍心有余悸地回答他，“一头大象。”“不，”他回答道，“非洲的灵魂总是以大象的形象出现。因为任何动物都是无法战胜大象的。狮子不行，水牛不行，蛇也不行。”
大家默默地回到了自己的泥坯屋之中，男孩子们吹熄了桌上的灯光。此时仍是黑夜，但是非洲最闪耀的一刻也越来越近了——黎明将至。

Five combat aircraft, presumably F-35s, were detected by the Venezuelan air defense system in the country’s airspace, Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said. 


"In the Maiquetia region, we detected more than five vectors with flight characteristics of 400 knots, flying at an altitude of 35,000 feet. These are combat aircraft that North American imperialism dared to bring close to Venezuelan shores ... This is rudeness, this is a provocation, this is a threat to national security," Lopez said on Thursday. 

The minister added that pilots of an international airline confirmed the presence of military aircraft, reporting sightings of F-35s off the Caribbean coast. 


"We've never seen such a deployment. We know that F-35s are stationed in Puerto Rico, but approaching Venezuelan territory - we want them to know we're aware of this and that it doesn't frighten us," Lopez said. 






The minister warned the United States about the risks of "miscalculation" and assured that the country is ready to repel any aggression. 

On Saturday, NBC News reported the United States was considering military strikes targeting drug cartels inside Venezuela and that the strikes could happen in the next several weeks. 

Earlier in the month, the president said that the US military conducted a second strike against "confirmed narcoterrorists from Venezuela" when they were in international waters transporting illegal drugs to the US. 

On August 19, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that US President Donald Trump was ready to use "every element of American power" to combat drug trafficking, without ruling out the possibility of a military operation in Venezuela. The statement was made following reports that Washington was deploying over 4,000 Marines and sailors to the waters off Latin America and the Caribbean to counter drug cartels.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[10月1日，国庆中秋长假文旅市场热度高涨，家庭出游成为主力。
   
10月1日，国庆中秋长假火热开场，文旅市场热度“爆棚”。
去哪儿旅行大数据显示，10月1日，乘坐飞机出行的用户数量达到长假期间最高峰，其中，国内乘坐飞机的外国旅客，同比增长四成以上，飞往了国内70个城市。
从入住酒店的情况来看，当日平台用户入住了国内近2000个县城、境外3000多个城市的酒店。各地文旅市场热点纷呈，“鸡排哥”带火江西景德镇酒店10月1日入住量增长30%；全国多地红色景区热度高，北京升旗仪式搜索热度环比上涨12倍。“China Travel”依旧火爆。

家庭游客是主力
双节叠加，家庭出游成为主流。去哪儿大数据显示，首日出行人群中，43%都是家庭出行，比去年高出3个百分点。“一老一小”出行增幅快。乘坐飞机的用户中，0～12岁出行用户同比增幅达到31%，60岁以上用户增长33%，13-18岁用户增长42%。从平台10月1日用户入住的酒店城市来看，全国Top20热门目的地是：北京、上海、重庆、南京、成都、杭州、长沙、青岛、西安、武汉、阿坝（四川）、广州、苏州、南昌、天津、深圳、贵阳、福州、洛阳、郑州。
热门景区仍在持续霸榜，人群“扎堆”的景点主要集中在自然景区、主题乐园和历史景点。10月1日，去哪儿平台上，景区门票预订量最高的Top10景区是：四川九寨沟、北京环球度假区、陕西西安兵马俑景区、湖南张家界国家森林公园、河南洛阳龙门石窟、安徽黄山、江西婺源篁岭、湖北恩施屏山峡谷、上海迪士尼度假区和江苏苏州拙政园。
去哪儿旅行大数据研究院研究员蔡木子分析，今年国庆、中秋双节连休，假期天数比去年多一天，出游与阖家团圆需求叠加，家庭多人出游占比增幅明显，助推总体出行量快速增长，预计今年国庆中秋假期整体旅游热度将超以往。

反向旅游，“鸡排哥”火了
除了去繁华大都市过节，反向旅游、小城寻秋，也是许多人的选择。秋景“天花板”多在小城。去哪儿数据显示，10月1日，平台用户入住了全国近2000个县城的酒店和民宿。TOP10热门县城是：四川九寨沟、福建平潭、广西阳朔、新疆布尔津、江西婺源、吉林安图、贵州荔波、浙江淳安、四川小金、湖南凤凰。值得一提的是，近日在网络上爆火的"鸡排哥"也吸引了不少网友前去景德镇游玩。去哪儿数据显示，10月1日，景德镇酒店入住量较去年同期增长了30%，增幅高于去年。
具体来看，如何避开“人从众”？携程方面透露，今年国庆预订窗口比往年提前一周，小众目的地搜索量同比增长超110%。携程口碑榜最新公布的“国内10月小众目的地榜”直接剔除热门扎堆，把丽水云和梯田、黔东南肇兴侗寨、盐城中华麋鹿园、甘南扎尕那等20处“低热度、高体验”的国内目的地及景区纳入榜单；而“国内10月赏秋目的地榜”则在延续北京、上海、成都等经典线路的基础上将例如甘孜、阿坝、额济纳旗等并不常见的赏秋目的地指引给到资深旅行者们，同时新增本溪、湖州、昆明等同时入选中国50赏秋目的地的高分秋景观赏地。
携程口碑榜数据显示，这些目的地普遍具备“连续入选年度目的地榜”或“特色体验指标位居全省前列”的基础，却在游客10月出行目的地占比仅占个位数，从而兼顾了“景美”与“人少”。
自驾游升温
假期内自驾游热度升温。途牛截至目前最新预订数据显示，今年国庆中秋假期首日途牛用户出游人次较去年同期增长近10%。其中，自驾游、自由行用户出游人次增长更为显著。
途牛方面表示，今年国庆与中秋双节合并，假期出行呈现度假、探亲双高峰的显著特征，“请3休12”的错峰游模式备受游客青睐，截至目前最新预订数据显示近20%的途牛用户选择在假期前（10月1日前）开启旅程。9月27日以来，途牛用户出游人次便持续攀升，并在假期首日即10月1日迎来今年国庆中秋假期的出游峰值。
假期首日途牛用户出游人次环比前一天（9月30日）增长超一倍。其中，境内游热度增长更为显著，假期首日出游人次环比前一天增长超130%。途牛境内打包旅游产品中，假期首日自驾游出游人次环比前一天增长超三倍，跟团游及自由行用户出游人次环比前一天也都增长了一倍以上。]]></content>

Argentinian lawmarkers overturned two vetos by President Javier Milei on Thursday, marking a setback for the leader ahead of the a midterm election which could shape the future of his controversial economic reforms.
The Argentinian Senate invalidated his vetos on laws to increase funding for public universities and pediatric health care.
The vetos had already been rejected by the lower house of Congress, the Chamber of Deputies.
The development marks another blow to the budget-slashing Milei's aura of political invincibility.
The opposition-controlled Senate first overturned one of his vetos in September, reinstating a measure which increased spending for people with disabilities.

Trouble brewing for Milei
This comes at a time when Milei — who has built his presidency on austerity measures and drastic econonic reforms — is seeing his popularity drop amid a corruption scandal and public weariness. While his reforms have tamed inflation, his dramatic welfare cuts have severely affected universities, public hospitals and pensioners. 
His party was defeated at the polls in Buenos Aires' provincial polls last month as a result, an outcome which was seen as indicative of the mood going into the upcoming elections.
"There's a sensation of disenchantment and anger with the impact of the cutbacks," Sebastian Halperin, a political consultant in Buenos Aires, told Reuters. He noted Milei had failed to build crucial alliances to sway votes in Congress.
Meanwhile, the 54-year leader is struggling to shore up the Argentinian peso ahead of a meeting with US President Donald Trump to discuss a credit swap line.

About the latest vetos
Argentina's Senate overwhelmingly voted to overturn Milei's vetos by 59-7 for the bill boosting public funding for universities and 58-7 for the one on pediatric health care.
The president had blocked the bills arguing the country did not have enough money and that the new spending would jeopardize the fiscal balance.
After the Senate vote, some people gathered outside Congress to celebrate. "We've been fighting and resisting the government's atrocious underfunding of national universities for over a year," psychology student Tomas Bossi told the AFP news agency.
Left-wing Senator Daniel Bensusan argued that the debate over public funding was not "technical, fiscal, or accounting-related," but "political and moral."

Seyed Mohammad Marandi, Tehran University professor and political analyst, told Sputnik that Putin demonstrated clear moral leadership on Palestine during his Valdai address.


"Western countries have enabled this genocide, they've supported the genocide, whereas the Russians have been seeking to find a solution to end this horrific chapter in human history."

He added that President Putin correctly identified Hamas as an essential part of any Palestinian peace process.


“President Putin is saying is that, for any solution, the Palestinian people collectively must have their rights recognized and their voices heard.”

On Monday, Trump unveiled a 20-point plan to resolve the situation in Gaza. The proposal calls for an immediate ceasefire on the condition that hostages are released within 72 hours.

The plan also stipulates that Hamas and other groups must agree not to take part in governing Gaza, either directly or indirectly. Control of the enclave would be handed over to technocratic authorities under the supervision of an international body headed by Trump himself.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[美國財長貝森特表示，美中下一輪貿易談判預料會有重大突破，他對中國以美國農民作為談判籌碼，表示遺憾，下周二將公布援助農民計劃。

美國財政部長貝森特，周四接受財經頻道CNBC訪問，稱總統特朗普和國家主席習近平月底將在南韓會面，他亦將率領談判團隊與國務院副總理何立峰會談。他說由於兩國元首將面對面談話，這回合談判應該會是最好的一次，會有重大突破。

中美雙方之前同意「關稅休戰」延長90天，11月10日將到期，貝森特指出，兩國元首直接對談，對框架設定、推進經貿很有幫助，談判亦會容易很多。

特朗普早前在網上帖文，提到同習近平會面時，會以大豆為主要議題，中國是全球第一大豆進口國，其中大約兩成從美國入口，但據報關稅戰爆發後，中國自5月以來沒有採購美國大豆。

貝森特對中方在談判中，把美國農民，特別是大豆農民作為籌碼，表示遺憾，指中國不採購美國大豆，部分將透過與其他國家的貿易協議補上，美國與所有國家的協議，幾乎都包括農產品採購項目。

貝森特又表示，他周三同農業部長羅林斯在白宮會面，財政部將於下周二公布新的農業援助方案，特別針對大豆農民，協助他們度過難關。《華爾街日報》報道，援助方案總額達100億美元。

特朗普去年勝出總統選舉，美國農民的支持至關重要。有貿易專家分析，中美過去的貿易衝突，多數集中在科技和原材料，例如稀土、晶片等，如今轉向農業，反映兩國談判形勢，已進入更貼近基層民生和選票層面。]]></content>

Europe’s hostile stance is driven by internal political failure and Ukraine's desperate situation on the battlefield, Dmitry Suslov, deputy director of the Center for European and International Studies at Russia’s Higher School of Economics and deputy director of research at the Russian Council on Foreign and Defense Policy told Sputnik.


"They are hysterical, they are working towards escalation… using Russia as an enemy image to preserve the power of current elites who have bankrupted themselves."

Suslov highlighted that this political desperation manifests in reckless military and hybrid provocations, including coordinated drone operations and the illegal seizure of vessels. He emphasized that France’s detention of a Russian tanker in neutral waters set a dangerous precedent of state-level piracy.

“Putin called the attack and detention of a Russian tanker in neutral waters piracy, because that is exactly what it is from the point of view of international law.”

Despite these pressures, Suslov affirmed that Russia’s economy and strategic partnerships remain robust, enabling sustained resistance to Western sanctions. He noted that key Global South partners continue to deepen cooperation with Moscow, particularly in energy and security.

“No collapse of the Russian economy is imminent, no matter what sanctions are imposed on Russia.”]]></content>

Watch: Rescuers search rubble and people queue for aid after deadly earthquake shakes Philippines


ByVirma Simonette and Koh Ewe



Published
3 October 2025, 00:52 BST


Updated 03:59 BST


Two days after a magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck her hometown in the central Philippines, Arguel Estalicas says she still feels dizzy everytime she stands up.
That spinning feeling, coupled with a string of aftershocks, has left the 35-year-old tourism officer and many other survivors too scared to return to their homes, forcing them to live in tents temporarily.
The earthquake shook the northern coast of Cebu, one of the country's most populous islands, on the night of 30 September, jolting many out of their sleep.
It killed at least 68 people and wounded more than 500 others, as homes, buildings and churches collapsed and roads cracked.
"I still couldn't process what has happened to us," Ms Estalicas  tells the BBC. "I am overwhelmed with the things we experienced in the last two days."
The 35-year-old lives in Medellin town, near the quake's epicentre. Disaster response officials say the earthquake displaced nearly 80,000 people across Cebu and nearby provinces. Cebu is a major trading and transportation hub in the central Philippines.
She said she got out of bed screaming when the earthquake struck and ran outdoors with her family.
They slept under the open sky, but when a light drizzle fell, Ms Estalicas and her family wrapped themselves up in plastic bags because they did not have raincoats.
Photos on social media showed them slouched on plastic chairs, swathed in plastic bags fogged up by their breath.

On the night of the earthquake, residents gathered under the open sky and used plastic bags for shelter when it started to rain


About 10km (6.2 miles) away, in San Remigio municipality, Lourenze Pareja also spent the night outdoors on the night of the earthquake.
"There, under the night sky, we sat freely - in great faith - with our little lights, holding on to what resources we had," Mr Pareja wrote on Facebook. "Pray for us, everyone."
When the ground started shaking, Mr Pareja said he grabbed his phone and ran to the street to livestream the unfolding chaos - neighbours in pyjamas leaving their homes, with their children and pets in tow.
"Lord," the 25-year-old community journalist said in the livestream, calling out to God, seemingly unable to say much else.
He said he checked neighbouring Bogo town and saw solar lamps casting a dim glow over streets strewn with boulders.
"What was once a vibrant city has turned into a ghost town," he said.


Food, water and fuel needed


The Philippines is vulnerable to natural disasters. It is located on the geologically unstable "Ring of Fire" - so called because of the high number of earthquakes and volcanoes that occur here.
The Cebu earthquake on Tuesday is among the strongest and deadliest in recent years. In 2013, a 7.2-magnitude earthquake in neighbouring Bohol island killed over 200 people and destroyed centuries-old churches.
On Thursday, rescuers searched through rubble as authorities worked to deliver food, restore power and communication lines, and clear roads of debris.
The Philippine military has deployed troops to help maintain order during relief efforts.

However, daily necessities remain a pressing concern for many.
Photographer Doods Demape decided on Thursday to make a four-hour drive from Medellin to the provincial capital to buy supplies since no supermarkets were open.
Mr Demape says he struggled to find a petrol station that was not swamped with long queues.
"Most roads are now passable so supplies are now coming in from the city. But immediate supplies like water and food, especially for the children are not yet available," he tells the BBC.
In Bogo city, the quake's epicentre, local media reports show body bags lined on the street in front of makeshift hospitals where the injured are being treated.

The quake has left at least 68 people dead


This week's earthquake comes in the middle of a fierce typhoon season. Two back-to-back storms inundated large swathes of the country a week before.
Widespread floods from those storms and earlier monsoon rains have stirred public anger and triggered street protests.
Cebu is especially prone to typhoons. It lies on the general path of storms that form over the Pacific.
The island's northern region, the epicentre of Tuesday's quake, was struck by Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. That storm killed over 6,000 people in the entire central region.
Among the many buildings damaged by Tuesday's earthquake was a relocation site for survivors of Haiyan.
Despite their present challenges, Cebu locals like Ms Estalicas and Mr Pareja are hopeful that they could survive the earthquake, as they did after Haiyan and the calamities before it.
They say survivors are helping each other, what Filipinos call bayanihan or community.
"My only prayer is that help won't be delayed - and that neighbouring municipalities will also be considered and covered in these relief efforts," Mr Pareja said.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[真实性直接关系到资源开发秩序与市场公平。
   
针对一些矿业权人反映的矿产资源储量报告存在不实甚至造假行为，行业协会开始出手整治。
中国矿业权评估师协会制定的《固体矿产资源储量报告规则（2025）》（下称《规则》）日前公布。《规则》明确，指导本规则实施与应用的原则是透明性、实质性、胜任性（统称“三原则”），《规则》适用于资本与证券市场。
其中，透明性要求公开报告向投资者、潜在投资者及其专业顾问提供充分的信息。所提供的信息应清晰、无歧义，确保其能够准确理解报告内容，而不产生误导。
实质性要求公开报告中应包含投资者、潜在投资者及其专业顾问合理要求并预期获取的一切合理相关信息，以支持其对所报告的勘查靶区、勘查结果、资源量和储量作出合理且审慎的判断。
胜任性要求公开报告应以具备相应工作经验的专业人员（即胜任人）所负责完成的工作成果（如技术报告）为依据。胜任人应为中国矿业权评估师协会会员或经认可的专业组织成员。
《规则》提出，技术报告提供关于勘查靶区、勘查结果、资源量和储量估算等详细支持信息，应客观、公正地反映所报告事项，并须说明资源量估算的不确定性。公开报告勘查结果时，须包含充分信息，以便投资者对其重要性作出客观、审慎的判断。
“矿产资源储量是矿业权交易的基石，直接决定着矿业权的价值及交易额的高低。”专家表示，矿产资源一旦没有经过科学精准的储量评估，甚至是虚假评估，矿业权人就有可能面临巨大的投资损失，甚至是牢狱之灾。

中国矿业权评估师协会《固体矿产资源储量报告规则（2025）》的公告
中国矿业权评估师协会官网介绍，长期以来，我国矿产资源储量报告（地质勘查报告）实行的是“资质+单位”管理模式。2017年9月国务院取消“地质勘查资质”行政许可事项后，尚未出台有效措施保障市场良性竞争和报告质量，出现矿产资源底数不清、矿产资源储量信息不准等现象，一定程度上阻碍了新一轮找矿突破战略行动开展和矿业经济高质量发展。
业内专家称，当前，受多种因素影响，我国矿产资源储量评估还存在诸多问题，在个别地方、领域甚至出现了评估报告弄虚作假、以假乱真现象。既有评估机构及人员因专业素质不高、责任心不强、审核把关不严等因素，也有少数评估机构及人员为了既得利益，不惜违背原则、失守底线，在矿产资源储量评估中故意不报、瞒报，甚至弄虚作假等情况。
例如，青海省都秀台铜砷矿普查报告，经专家组认定，报告中的矿产资源品位数据不实，还存在隐瞒未见矿工程、违规圈联矿体等情况，导致品位提高、矿体扩大、储量增高等问题。
今年8月，中国政法大学教授阮齐林、国土资源法律研究中心主任李显冬、自然资源部咨询研究中心咨询委员杨璐等专家在调研河北省石家庄市井陉县玉源矿并作出的专家论证意见书称，“由于储量备案报告对第四系覆土厚度的认定错误以及对矿体断裂带的忽略，误将矿体上部的覆盖层认定为矿体”，致使采矿权人出现了“越层”开采现象。而实际上，采矿权人开采的矿产资源总量，并未超出获得该矿业权时的备案资源总储量。
“储量报告不实或虚假，通常有这些具体表现。”中国地质矿产经济学会资源与规划专业委员会副主任曹旭升介绍，砂石土类矿的勘查报告往往大矿做小，导致砂石土类矿矿业权出让收益少缴现象和矿业权到期不能延续现象非常普遍；年度核实报告往往不进行实测，导致实际开采情况与实际不符，进而导致年度监测数据不实；勘查报告人为降低品位现象较多，导致矿业权出让收益被低评，相应税费少缴。

此外，有些勘查报告隐瞒共伴生矿种，导致达到工业品位的共伴生矿种未进行矿业权出让收益评估，少缴税费；勘查单位不按勘查规范和勘查标准进行勘查并编制报告，导致报告不实。
专家介绍，国家层面对矿业权评估十分重视。2021年1月，人力资源和社会保障部专门把矿业权评估师列为《国家职业资格目录（专业技术人员职业资格）》。为落实国家职业资格制度改革要求，2022年5月，自然资源部出台了《矿业权评估师职业资格制度暂行规定》和《矿业权评估师职业资格考试实施办法》。
今年4月，自然资源部矿产资源保护监督司司长薄志平一行到中国矿业权评估师协会调研时强调，要聚焦新一轮找矿突破战略行动，围绕能源资源增储上产，不断改革创新，在矿产勘查、储量评估、价值评估等方面为市场、为管理部门提供有效的专业技术服务和支撑。
“矿产资源储量是国家制定资源战略、保障能源安全的核心依据，其真实性直接关系到资源开发秩序与市场公平。”业内专家表示，在矿业权一级市场，储量虚报往往造成出让价格与实际价值严重背离。在二级市场转让中，储量造假更是成为资本骗局的常用手段。从宏观战略层面看，储量不实或造假会导致国家矿产资源家底不清，使战略决策失去数据支撑，直接危及国家能源资源安全。
上述《规则》明确，中国矿业权评估师协会负责制订《固体矿产资源储量报告规则》，根据章程为会员提供服务，有纪律处分权，包括暂停会籍或开除会员的权力。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[《饮用水水源地水环境质量标准》也正在制定。
   
生态环境部正酝酿修订国家生态环境标准，进一步规范饮用水水源地生态环境保护建设，并为饮用水水源地环境保护专项执法行动及环境状况调查评估提供规范指引。
国家生态环境标准《集中式饮用水水源地规范化建设环境保护技术要求（征求意见稿）》已开始公开征求意见。据征求意见稿编制说明介绍，自2016年3月，《集中式饮用水水源地规范化建设环境保护技术要求》首次发布实施以来，该标准作为饮用水水源地管理的重要技术依据，支撑了《水污染防治行动计划》中饮用水水源水质和管理措施的实施与考核。
随着饮用水水源地整治的持续推进，污染防治重心逐步转移，深层次问题不断凸显。为适应新时期对饮用水水源地精准化、科学化保护的需求，聚焦当前饮用水水源地管理中的重点、难点问题，有必要对《技术要求》进行修订，以更高标准深入推进碧水保卫战，持续提升饮用水安全保障水平。
《关于深入打好污染防治攻坚战的意见》提出，巩固提升饮用水安全保障水平。加快推进城市水源地规范化建设，加强农村水源地保护。基本完成乡镇级水源保护区划定、立标并开展环境问题排查整治。到2025年，全国县级及以上城市集中式饮用水水源水质达到或优于Ⅲ类比例总体高于93%。
9月19日，生态环境部副部长郭芳在国新办新闻发布会上回答记者提问时介绍，目前，各地的饮用水水源保护区都是优先保护单元，禁止一切可能污染水源的开发建设活动。
编制说明介绍，“十四五”期间，县级及以上城市水源地规范化建设取得显著成效，水源地“划、立”工作基本完成，保护区内环境问题基本完成清理整治，监测监控范围不断扩大，风险防控与应急指标完成率较高。
生态环境部公布的统计数据显示，截至目前，全国已累计划定2.4万个乡镇级及以上集中式饮用水水源保护区。《饮用水水源地水环境质量标准》也正在制定。

编制说明介绍，现行标准与法律法规及标准规范存在衔接缺口，通过饮用水水源地环境状况调查评估、环境保护专项执法行动及研讨发现，现行标准部分条款在实际管理中可操作性不足。例如，保护区内雨洪排口兼具防洪排涝功能，但也存在一定雨污混排问题，极端情况下严重威胁水质安全，亟需通过标准修订建立雨污分类管理体系，明确差异化污染防治要求。
此外，保护区内存在农业种植、原住居民住宅及新农村建设工程等，在整治过程中暴露出粮食安全、民生保障、水质保护的一系列矛盾，需通过标准修订细化农田退水管控、居民生活污水及垃圾收集处理要求及相关污染防治措施。现行标准还缺乏完善的信息共享建设要求。
专家介绍，上述新规明确，在集中式饮用水水源地保护区内实施污染物排放禁止和限制性技术要求，在准保护区推行总量控制与行业负面清单，同时，在保护区、准保护区引入水污染防治、总量控制与削减措施等技术要求。允许地方根据水系、风险源、自然条件及水华态势特征科学布设及动态调整监测断面。
考虑到近年来因尾矿库泄漏引发了一系列饮用水水源地突发环境事件，征求意见稿在点源中增加了关于尾矿库的举例，农业面源污染（农药化肥流失）、城市径流污染（生活污染物）在面源中所占比重较高，在非点源中增加农业面源、城市径流等举例。
征求意见稿新增了生物预警监控定义及要求，即“生物预警监控为利用生物监测设施，根据不同水体导致的生物行为变化，从综合角度对水质变化情况进行分析和监控”。考虑到部分地区饮用水水源水质受自然和地质条件影响水质超标，且当地无其他替代水源的情况，征求意见稿提出，按照“实测实评”原则，采用实际监测数据进行水环境质量评价，客观反映水环境质量状况。
征求意见稿还提出，在饮用水水源取水口及周边人类活动可能导致水质污染的区域设置隔离防护设施；保护区内农田退水口排水需经生态沟渠、人工湿地净化后通过农业灌溉循环利用，不得直接排入饮用水水源保护区水体；保护区内城镇雨洪排口应开展溯源整治，禁止排放污水、影响饮用水水源安全；保护区内无新增经济林。保护区内农业种植禁止使用农药，严格控制化肥等非点源污染。]]></content>

 全球多策略投资公司Arena Investors将关闭新加坡办事处，并把资源重新分配到其他市场。
彭博社报道，知情人士透露，公司发现相较于北美和欧洲，亚洲投资在风险回报率和规模方面吸引力较低。不过，Arena仍对本区域具吸引力的投资机会持开放态度。
Arena亚太团队主要涉足机会型信贷投资，包括直接放贷、资产收购和合资企业的成立。公司指出，新加坡团队的大部分职能将由印度班加罗尔办事处接管，该办事处负责投资、资产服务和估值等全球业务。Arena在新西兰也设有办公室，专注房地产信贷投资，目前在亚太区共有约70名员工。
Arena发言人通过电邮回复媒体询问时说，公司“仍然致力于亚太市场”，“整体而言，我们在亚洲的员工人数将增加，但会继续根据不同时间点的最佳投资机会来分配资源”。
Arena总部位于纽约，专注于特殊情况的私人信贷投资，迄今已部署超过50亿美元（64亿新元）资金。今年5月，公司完成第三支机会型基金集资，募集超过10亿美元。
Arena关闭新加坡办事处之际，全球1.7万亿美元的私人信贷市场正面临逆风。随着违约风险上升，交易流量放缓，一些另类投资管理公司被迫暂停部署资金。就在本周，澳大利亚基金经理Tanarra Capital宣布暂停旗下困境信贷基金的新投资，而贝莱德（BlackRock）也同意与阿布扎比主权财富基金Mubadala结束私人信贷合作关系，原因同样是缺乏合适的投资项目。]]></content>

Venezuela on Thursday criticized what it called an "illegal incursion" by US fighter jets into an area under Venezuelan air traffic control, accusing Washington of a "provocation" that "threatens national sovereignty."
The Venezuelan government said the planes were detected 75 kilometers (46 miles) from the South American country's coastline.
Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez described the action as a "military harassment and threat" in a speech on Thursday broadcast by state television VTV.
"They are imperialist combat planes that have dared to come close to the Venezuelan coast," Padrino said.
"The presence of these planes flying close to our Caribbean Sea is a vulgarity, a provocation, a threat to the security of the nation," he added.

As Trump eyes Venezuela, Maduro urges people to join militia

How are relations between the US and Venezuela?
Tensions between the United States and Venezuela remain high.
US President Donald Trump last month dispatched 10 F-35 aircraft to Puerto Rico, a US territory in the Caribbean, as part of the biggest military deployment in the area in over three decades.
He also sent eight warships and a nuclear submarine to the region as part of a stated operation to combat drug trafficking across the Caribbean to the United States.
The US has attacked several vessels from Venezuela in the Caribbean in recent weeks, killing at least 14 people, highlighting alleged drug trafficking.
These allegations have been rejected by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
Maduro has alleged that Washington is seeking regime change, but has also offered to have talks with US envoy Richard Grenell.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[这次选举的胜者如无意外，将成为日本下任首相。
   
经过两周的备选，日本自民党总裁选举即将迎来“最后时刻”。
根据日本自民党总裁选举管理委员公告，共有5人报名参加本届自民党总裁选举，投票将于10月4日举行，届时将选出新一任总裁。这次选举的胜者如无意外，将成为日本下任首相。
农林水产大臣小泉进次郎、前经济安全保障担当大臣高市早苗、内阁官房长官林芳正、前经济安全保障担当大臣小林鹰之以及自民党前干事长茂木敏充，5位候选人已在做“最后冲刺”。
选前最接近投票日的民调显示，25%的受访者支持高市早苗，21%的受访者支持小泉进次郎。但针对自民党内议员的民调却结果截然不同：截至9月28日，有日媒采访了295名自民党议员中的265人。结果显示，小泉进次郎获得的支持率最高，有71人支持；其次是林芳正，获得52人支持；38名议员支持高市早苗；小林鹰之和茂木敏充均获得29人支持。
日本企业（中国）研究院执行院长陈言告诉第一财经，一年前，岸田文雄辞职的一个最大原因就是彼时震动日本政坛的安倍派的黑金丑闻，“岸田本人没有解决，继任者石破茂解决了吗？答案是显而易见的。当前的5位候选人都在竞选中都没有提及黑金丑闻。这一问题的继续存在，注定会给今后的日本政坛埋下一个动荡的隐患。”

从线下走到线上
这次的日本自民党总裁选举将采用全规格型选举办法，共有590票。其中，295名自民党国会议员每人一票，各地普通党员和“党友”（即注册支持者）按比例折合成295张地方票，获得半数以上选票者胜出。如无人过半，则由得票前两名进入第二轮投票。第二轮投票中，295名自民党国会议员各持一票，47个都道府县自民党支部联合会各有一票，共计342票，最终得票多者当选。以往，自民党总裁选举均会进入第二轮投票。
此次5位候选人不仅都参加了去年的总裁选举，同时也是日本政坛的“老面孔”。两周的备选在白热化之余，也是跌宕起伏。
与以往不同，9月22日选战开始正式开始后，5位候选人争相在社交平台“圈地”。比如，小泉进次郎在9月22日当天就开通个人社交平台账号，要求其阵营内成员在网络上发布称赞自己并暗讽竞争对手的评论；高市早苗在正式宣布参选后，个人社交账号6天内已发布了7条视频；茂木敏充则把日常工作，比如把视察儿童食堂的情况搬到了社交媒体上；小林鹰之晒出“忙碌竞选中的午餐”等。网友对此评论不一。比如，网友捕捉到了茂木敏充在工作视频中的尴尬表情，称其“作秀”成分太多；而小林鹰之的午餐视频则遭网友群嘲。
值得注意的是，在一次电视辩论中，当主持人要求5位候选人用英文回应未来的日美关系时，仅有林芳正与茂木敏充用英语回答。此事也让日本网友为未来首相与美国政府打交道的能力捻一把汗。
在各大民调支持率领先的两位候选人小泉进次郎和高市早苗也差点在线上“翻车”。选战开始后，有日媒爆料，小泉进次郎的竞选团队公关负责人的办公室就被曝向支持者发送邮件，要求后者在网上公开赞美小泉。“刷好评”事件曝光后，小泉进次郎于9月26日召开记者会，承认这一事实并为此公开道歉，但强调不考虑退出党总裁选举。相反，小泉关闭了社交媒体平台X的评论区，继续参选。
高市早苗也在竞选中麻烦不少。她在公开阐述自己的方针政策时称“外国游客在奈良虐鹿”，被指部分言论与事实不符，陷入了“说假话”风波，引发网友质疑。面对要求澄清事实，高市仅在公开场合表示，“会用自己的方法确认”。
各有哪些政策
此次5位候选人各自的特点也较为鲜明。比如，高市早苗在自民党内担任过要职，但为了参选模糊了一些具有极右翼色彩的政治主张；小泉进次郎年轻、形象清新；林芳正担任过外务大臣，在对华、对美外交方面具备实务经验；小林鹰之主打经济政策等议题，但知名度相对较低；茂木敏充作为资深政治家，也拥有丰富的党内经验。
虽然候选人主张各有侧重，但均提及“日本复兴”“自民党振兴”“严控外国人土地交易”等话题。
在经济方面，高市早苗一贯主张维持货币宽松与扩张性的财政政策，被视为“安倍经济学”的继承者。去年竞选时，她公开反对日本央行加息。今年又提出将食品消费税从8%彻底降至零的构想；提高免税收入门槛；将成立日本外国投资委员会，加强对外国投资的审查；致力于建立现金发放与所得税减免相结合的制度；将考虑对外国人购买房产采取更严格措施等。
小泉进次郎则被视为自民党内的“新生代”。此次除了拉来一众自民党大佬加入自己的竞选阵营外，小泉表示关注把经济视为首要任务，力争继续扩大工资增幅，同时关注日本国内的“过渡旅游”（overtourism）问题，打击非法外籍劳工等。
资本市场正在屏息静待最后一刻。投资者普遍认为，高市早苗的胜选将引发市场剧烈波动，其政策倾向可能推动政府支出增加，从而带动股市上涨。 ‌而小泉进次郎胜选，由于他的政策更为自由化和稳健，分析认为日元或有所走强，日债收益率或有所下降，日股反应或较为平静。
当然，面对当前多人混战、两强对立的自民党总裁选举格局，有日媒评论称，最终的投票仍存在不确定性，选情随时会被网络舆论等因素改变。
陈言分析称，就民意来看，高市早苗和小泉进次郎领跑，林芳正位居第三，“但对于高市早苗而言，一个残酷的现实是今年7月参议院选举中参政党的崛起，分流了部分自民党的保守势力。如果高市早苗上台的话，她在政治上一旦得不到这些保守人士的呼应，那也无法给自民党带来大量的选票，她将面对的是一场更艰难的选举。高市早苗的人气能不能维持到最后一刻不好说。”
同时，陈言表示，党内议员也都在盘算，如果高市早苗当了总裁，以后自己当议员的可能性还有多大，这也会成为是否投票支持高市的关键因素之一，“毕竟高市早苗在党内的影响弱于在舆论中的影响。”
对于小泉进次郎，陈言认为，44岁的他很年轻，但没有非常完整的政策，他想维持一个长期政权比较困难。
在陈言看来，比较稳健的还是林芳正，但他在自民党内外都缺乏人气，“而且他在自民党内虽然说是和岸田一派，此前岸田还考虑东山再起，所以不一定会支持林芳正。这样的话就看林芳正在最后一刻有没有翻盘的能力。”
无论谁在自民党总裁选举中胜出，在彭博高级经济学家木村太郎（Taro Kimura）看来，都要一边领导一个在众议院未占据多数席位的联合政府，一边要努力确保首相职位。“目前来看反对党阵营似乎缺乏协调，因此下一任自民党总裁继任首相的可能性较大。”他告诉第一财经。
5人的表现也引发了在野党的关注。日本最大在野党立宪民主党干事长安住淳表示，“很可能无论谁当选总裁，情况都不会有太大变化，只是换了张面孔而已。”]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[俄羅斯表示，一旦美國向烏克蘭提供「戰斧」導彈，俄方將會有對等回應。在俄烏戰事膠著之際，俄羅斯總統普京稱，有意全面恢復與美國的關係。

美國副總統萬斯日前透露，美國正考慮向烏克蘭提供「戰斧」巡航導彈。俄羅斯總統新聞秘書佩斯科夫周四表示，假如美國向烏克蘭提供這種導彈，將會是緊張局勢的又一次嚴重升級，俄方會有對等回應。總統普京則表示，「戰斧」導彈已經不再是先進武器，不會改變戰場狀況。

俄羅斯外交部發言人批評烏方及其西方支持者，沒有和平解決俄烏衝突的意願，只一心堅持跟俄方武裝對抗的方針。

普京說，假如歐洲國家仍然想在軍事上與俄羅斯鬥爭，俄方會迅速反擊。不過他同時表明，俄方無意攻擊以美國為首的北約，並否認向丹麥發射無人機，批評北約國家炒作無人機事件，以此作為增加國防開支的藉口。

他又表示，俄羅斯正尋求與美國全面恢復關係，指雙方雖然有明顯分歧，但兩個強國之間有不同意見是平常不過。

另外，自俄烏戰爭爆發後，西方國家凍結俄羅斯央行在海外的資產。德國總理默茨周四在歐洲領導人非正式會議上說，他贊成動用凍結的俄羅斯資產，援助烏克蘭，並告誡普京不要低估歐洲國家的決心，又透露在下一次歐洲理事會會議上會就運用俄羅斯資產作決定。

不過匈牙利總理歐爾班就唱反調，反對動用那些資產，表示絕不會觸碰他人財產。]]></content>

 华业集团（UOL）联合子公司新加坡置地和凯德发展组成的财团完成收购私宅项目汤申景花园（Thomson View）。
华业集团和新加坡置地星期四（3月2日）在新加坡交易所网站宣布，这项集体出售交易已完成。
财团在去年11月以8亿1000万元收购这个项目，成交价比原本的9亿1800万元要价低12%。
由于有六名屋主向分层地契局提出反对，以至于当局在今年3月对这座公寓发出禁售令。高等法院在今年7月批准这笔交易.
集售交易获得通过，每户可获222万元至494万元，项目中的唯一商店业主可获得387万元。
若根据8亿1000万元的交易价计算，容积率每平方英尺价格为1178元，这包括土地增值费和填补地契到99年的费用。
根据2019年发展总蓝图，这个地段被划为住宅用途，容积率为2.1，按平均住宅面积85平方米计算，它最多可兴建1240个私宅单位，预料将发展成近年来最大的私宅项目之一。

故宫，也许是中国最有故事的地方。从屋顶脊兽到鎏金门钉，都在生动讲述着历史烟云，世事沧桑。前朝后寝的每一座宫殿，都有两朝三世的“宫斗”剧本；而馆藏的186万件珍贵文物，更是串起了中华千万年的浩瀚文明。世界各地的人们到北京，故宫几乎是必选项。
“推开一扇门，两朝三世六百年。”从皇宫到博物院，六百多年来的故宫从不缺乏关于皇权、关于瑰宝、关于深宫的神秘想象和窥探。
1925年，“故宫博物院”匾额被挂上昔日皇家宫殿厚重的正红宫门。如今，开放百年的故宫迎来芸芸众生。在高大威严的建筑群间，不同的人，看到不一样的别人和自己。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[自1981年以来，美国已经历14次政府部分关门，最近一次发生在2018年底至2019年初，持续35天，为史上最长纪录。
   
在美国国会参议院于当地时间30日晚间未能投票通过短期支出拨款法案后，美国联邦政府被迫于10月1日凌晨开始关门，这是美国自2018年以来首次因拨款中断而导致政府关门。
周二当晚，参议院的投票结果为55票赞成、45票反对，该提案需要60票才能通过。两名民主党参议员：宾夕法尼亚州参议员费特曼（John Fetterman）和内华达州参议员马斯托（Catherine Cortez Masto）与共和党一起投票支持该提案，共和党参议员肯塔基州参议员保罗（Rand Paul）则与民主党人站在一起反对该提案。
自1981年以来，美国已经历14次政府部分关门，最近一次发生在2018年底至2019年初，持续35天，为美国史上最长纪录。

特朗普让步无果
为了避免让政府关门，特朗普在一天前作出让步，决定在白宫与民主党高层、众议院少数党领袖杰弗里斯(Hakeem Jeffries)和参议院少数党领袖舒默见面，但是双方最后仍然没有达成共识。
舒默在会后表示，两党之间仍然有非常大的分歧，美国副总统万斯则表示，联邦政府正在走向关门。
特朗普在会后警告，关门期间政府可能采取“不可逆转”措施，包括大规模裁员。
在政府关门的几小时前，白宫管理和预算办公室(OMB)要求联邦机构启动关门计划。“特朗普总统支持通过H.R. 5371，但现在很明显，民主党将阻止这项法案在今晚11:59之前通过，并迫使政府关门。”OMB主任沃特（Russell Vought）在写给各政府机构负责人的信中写道，“因此，受影响的机构现在应该执行有序关门计划。”
多个政府机构已经宣布的关门计划中包括让数千名联邦雇员暂时休假，许多其他机构则将继续无薪工作。
沃特当天早些时候表示，政府有权“对官僚机构进行永久性改革”，例如裁减工作岗位和项目，而不仅仅是让政府工作人员暂时休假。
两党：双方分歧不可弥合
通常情况下，在政府即将关门前的几个小时甚至几天里，国会两党成员和助手们都会忙着谈判，试图在最后一刻找到可能的解决办法。
但是，参与本次谈判的消息人士透露，在周一特朗普与国会成员的白宫会晤未能取得任何进展后，周二国会山的气氛不是如何进行谈判，而是讨论关于这次关门可能持续多久。
北卡罗来纳州共和党参议员蒂利斯（Thom Tillis）表示，这次的政府关门时间可能会持续“超过一周”。“我们之间的差距实在太大了，今天的谈判并没有比一个月前更接近达成协议。”他说。
参议院多数党领袖图恩(John Thune)则在周二表示，在民主党同意重新开放政府之前，他不会与民主党就资金诉求进行谈判。
参议院民主党领袖舒默警告称，民主党准备无限期关闭联邦机构，直到共和党同意解决因《平价医疗法案》增加的补贴到期而导致的医疗保险费上涨问题。
图恩则表示，他排除与舒默就一项旨在重启政府的替代法案进行谈判的可能性。“谈判是在政府开门的情况下才能进行的。”图恩说。
舒默则表示，民主党参议员将坚持立场，直到共和党领导人同意他们的要求。“你看，解决这个问题是他们的事情，这是他们自己的事情，政府关门是他们的事情。”舒默谈到共和党成员时说，“他们将面临来自美国人民的巨大压力。”
舒默还说，他在周一白宫会议上直截了当地告诉特朗普，总统将承担大部分责任，因为控制白宫和国会的都是共和党。
路易斯安那州共和党参议员肯尼迪（John Kennedy）表示，许多共和党人认为民主党的要求非常不切实际，导致议员们对如何让联邦部门和机构恢复运转毫无头绪。“我们不会同意他们提出的1.5万亿美元的要求。那么，我的朋友舒默参议员，你该如何让政府重新运转呢？”肯尼迪问道。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[目前暂列档期新片票房榜前三的影片分别是《志愿军：浴血和平》《刺杀小说家2》和《浪浪人生》。
   
恰逢中秋与国庆双节叠加，今年国庆档共八天，档期内新片数量多达十部，涵盖战争、奇幻、喜剧、犯罪、动画等多元类型。
根据灯塔专业版实时数据，截至10月1日20时，国庆档首日票房突破3亿，与去年国庆档首日的4.9亿票房相比，尚有一定距离。
截至目前，档期累计票房（含点映及预售）突破3.8亿元。目前暂列档期新片票房榜前三的影片分别是《志愿军：浴血和平》《刺杀小说家2》和《浪浪人生》。

主旋律题材仍具市场号召力
作为陈凯歌执导的《志愿军》系列收官之作，《志愿军：浴血和平》聚焦抗美援朝第五次战役后至停战协议签署期间的作战历程。重点呈现“边打边谈”的双线叙事：既还原前线战场的浴血拼杀，也揭秘谈判桌上的外交博弈。在战争类型中，该片较为少见地以女性角色为主人公，集结了张子枫、宋佳、朱亚文等演员，共同诠释和平来之不易的主题。
作为连续三年登陆国庆档的系列IP，《志愿军》系列此前已积累了一定的观众基础。2024年《志愿军：存亡之战》以12.06亿元斩获当年国庆档票房冠军，2023年首部《志愿军：雄兵出击》也收获8.68亿元票房。今年的《浴血和平》在市场表现上面临续作乏力的挑战，截至目前影片累计票房突破1.2亿，灯塔专业版AI预测其总票房为7.9亿元，或将不及《存亡之战》和《雄兵出击》。
2021年春节档，由路阳执导的《刺杀小说家》以富于想象力的特效和美术设计拿到10.35亿票房。今年国庆档的《刺杀小说家2》由原班人马打造，主演方面，董子健、雷佳音继续出演，加入了饰演反派赤发鬼的邓超，新晋威尼斯影后辛芷蕾也在片中出演新角色。

该片延续了前作现实世界与异世界双线交织的奇幻设定，讲述陷入人生低谷的小说家路空文意外唤醒赤发鬼，导致双世界危机爆发，联合伙伴展开拯救的故事。从目前评价来看，部分观众认为该片剧情和文戏较弱，特效表现较好，猫眼专业版预测其票房为7.23亿，或将不及前作。
值得一提的是，今年国庆档还有一部“非新片”表现亮眼。虽已上映两周，《731》仍在国庆档首日占据18.6%的票房份额，位列第三。《731》以侵华日军第七三一部队的细菌战罪行为主线，通过虚构角色与真实事件交织的方式，揭露了该部队在哈尔滨市平房区进行活体实验的黑暗历史。尽管影片口碑两极，但并未显著影响该片票房走势，截至目前累计票房已突破15.7亿。
现实主义题材有望成黑马
头部影片之外，今年国庆档包含多部现实主义题材影片。尽管还未正式上映，定档10月4日的《震耳欲聋》以超4000万预售票房暂列档期第四，展现出较强的市场潜力。
《震耳欲聋》取材自CODA（聋人家庭的健听子女）律师张琪的真实从业经历，聚焦聋人群体遭遇定制化骗局的困境。檀健次饰演的主角李淇是一名“灰度律师”，出身聋人家庭却刻意切割与原生家庭的联系，初期以高价律师费回绝聋人女孩的求助，却在接触案件后逐渐觉醒。影片通过李淇从追逐名利到为沉默者发声的转变，推动社会重新审视对残障家庭的支持体系。

同样聚焦现实的还有喜剧片《浪浪人生》，该片由黄渤、范丞丞、殷桃等主演，改编自蔡崇达的散文集《皮囊》。影片以闽南沿海小镇为背景，讲述了一个普通家庭在生活风浪中相互扶持、笑泪交织的故事。截至目前，该片累计票房突破5400万元。
此外，动画电影《三国的星空第一部》、港产片《风林火山》、犯罪剧情片《毕正明的证明》构成了档期内的多元补充。
《三国的星空第一部》由易中天担任编剧及监制，影片以星空为意象，通过曹操青壮年时期的人生历程，重新解构历史人物，展现乱世中英雄的抉择与使命。由香港导演麦浚龙历时八年打造，聚集了金城武、刘青云、梁家辉、古天乐等明星的《风林火山》以20世纪90年代的香港为背景，讲述贩毒家族与警方的势力博弈，美学上风格独特。《毕正明的证明》是一部聚焦反扒警察与盗窃团伙博弈的犯罪剧情片，由王安宇、张天爱等主演，讲述了一个关于正义、抉择与自我证明的故事。
不过鉴于上述三部影片口碑较为平淡，票房也相应无突出表现。《三国的星空第一部》票房表现为2354万，《风林火山》成色低于预期，与其制作成本有较大落差，目前仅录得2190万，而《毕正明的证明》票房不及偏低龄向的动画片《猪猪侠·一只老猪的逆袭》为1190万。
今年国庆档在供给与档期时长上扩容，类型较去年更趋多元，新增聋人反诈、历史动画等小众题材，展现出市场对类型创新的尝试。另一方面，目前来看缺乏兼具口碑与票房号召力的作品，续作创新乏力，加上观众观影决策日趋谨慎，使得档期整体呈现出热闹有余、活力不足的态势。接下来，假期后半程的口碑发酵与长尾效应，将决定档期的最终成色。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[原油跌至四个月低位。
   
周四（2日）国际油价震荡走低，WTI原油近月合约逼近60美元关口，刷新四个月低位。美国政府停摆给全球最大经济体需求前景带来考验，与此同时本周末将举行的产油国联盟欧佩克+（OPEC+）部长级会议可能进一步增产的报道加剧了供需关系的压力。不过，地缘政治因素可能成为重大变量，俄罗斯和伊朗的供应安全或将引发油价短期性剧烈波动。
供应端前景
按照日程安排，OPEC+主要成员国将于10月5日举行线上会议，商议11月的产量安排。OPEC+的石油产量约占全球总量的一半，其成员包括石油输出国组织欧佩克成员国，以及俄罗斯等非欧佩克产油盟国。
为了平衡疫情后市场，OPEC+2022年以来的减产规模在峰值时达到585万桶/日，这一减产额度由三部分构成：220万桶/日的自愿减产、165万桶/日的额外减产，以及该组织全体成员共同实施的200万桶/日的减产。
自今年4月起，OPEC+已放弃减产策略。该组织此举一方面是为了提升市场份额，另一方面也是受到美国总统特朗普施压，要求其降低油价。8个参与减产的OPEC+成员国在9月底前，完全取消此前减产计划中的一项 ——220万桶/日的自愿减产。从10月开始，这些国家已开始着手取消第二项减产（165万桶/日），当月将实现13.7万桶/日的增产。
据媒体援引三位消息人士透露，由于各成员国继续寻求重新夺回市场份额，预计该组织将确认11月原油日产量至少再增加13.7万桶。
不过，虽然正在持续释放产能，OPEC+目前连现有产量目标都未能实现。行业统计显示，4月至8月期间，OPEC+仅完成了75%的增产目标，较该时期的计划增产量少了近50万桶/日。
在欧佩克考虑增产的同时，伊拉克石油部称，在一项临时协议打破僵局后，上周六开始原油首次通过输油管道从伊拉克北部库尔德地区输送至土耳其，此次中断时长已达两年半。据报道，美国此前一直推动恢复这一原油出口通道。而该通道恢复后，预计最终将通过土耳其的杰伊汉港（Ceyhan port）为国际市场每日新增至多23万桶原油供应。
地缘政治扰动
俄乌冲突等地缘政治因素可能成为重大变量，推动油价短线涨势。
俄罗斯副总理诺瓦克（Alexander Novak）于上月25日宣布，俄罗斯将对柴油出口实施部分禁令，有效期至今年年底，并延长现行的汽油出口禁令。炼油产能下降已导致俄罗斯多个地区面临特定品级燃料短缺的问题。
市场正在持续关注俄罗斯原油流向，同时评估两项潜在影响：一是欧盟拟对第三国石油行业实体实施制裁的提案，二是特朗普总统多次呼吁北约盟友停止购买俄罗斯能源。
原油经纪商PVM高级分析师瓦尔加（Tamas Varga）在接受第一财经记者采访时表示，俄乌局势的进展变得扑朔迷离，俄罗斯成品油出口量正接近2020年以来的最低装船水平，受到影响规模达到100万桶/日。
他进一步分析称，既然俄罗斯炼油厂已遭受且将持续遭受损失，该国或将通过增加原油出口来弥补石油销售的收入缺口。但乌克兰方面已袭击了俄罗斯位于普里莫尔斯克（Primorsk）和新罗西斯克（Novorossiysk）的原油装货设施，因此这种 “以原油出口替代成品油出口” 的方案，似乎并非如此简单可行。过去十年间，俄罗斯石油收入占该国财政预算的比例介于30%至50%之间。
与此同时，在欧洲多国启动相关程序后，联合国已恢复对伊朗核计划实施武器禁运及其他制裁措施。德黑兰方面此前已发出警告，称将对这些制裁采取强硬回应。2025年6月至8月，伊朗的石油平均日出口量超过160万桶。
市场前景如何
由于对潜在不确定性的见解不同，国际能源署（IEA）和欧佩克两大机构在市场月报中给出了不同预测。
国际能源署上月进一步上调石油供应预期， 将今年全球石油需求增长预期从之前的每日68.5万桶上调至每日73.7万桶；预计明年全球石油需求每日将增长69.8万桶。今年全球石油供应每日将增长270万桶，而此前的预测分别为今年每日增长250万桶。由于石油供应增长持续远超需求，全球石油市场未来面临的过剩规模将比此前预期更大。
值得一提的是，在OPEC+全力增产的同时，受美国、巴西、加拿大和圭亚那产量增加的推动，国际能源署将今年 “OPEC +” 以外产油国的供应增长预期上调至140万桶/日。
国际能源署表示：“一系列因素正将石油市场推向不同方向 —— 一方面，对俄罗斯和伊朗的新制裁可能导致供应减少；另一方面，‘欧佩克 +’供应增加，目前对伊朗和俄罗斯实施的更严格制裁，对石油供应及贸易流向的影响相对有限。然而，欧盟计划于明年初生效的俄罗斯原油精炼产品进口禁令，可能在未来数月内抑制石油产量，并扰乱贸易格局。”
相比之下，欧佩克维持石油需求预期不变。该组织预计，在主要地区强劲经济活动的支撑下，今年全球石油需求将每日增长129万桶，明年将每日增长138万桶。
与此同时，全球经济增长预期在今明两年分别维持在3%和3.1%。欧佩克表示，主要经济体的消费者支出依然具有韧性，且与财政刺激措施一道，预计将继续为经济增长提供支撑。
瓦尔加向第一财经记者表示，短期内俄罗斯出口能力下降可能带来复杂问题，以及可能面临进一步制裁的 “达摩克利斯之剑”，限制了油价下跌的空间。尽管如此，欧佩克选择继续推动增产仍有其逻辑：该组织或许尚未具备充分释放产能的能力，但如果当前的核心目标是夺回市场份额，就必须向新老客户证明，欧佩克能始终如一地满足他们的石油需求，且不会受内部纷争影响，也不会通过操控供应量来干预油价。
加拿大皇家银行资本市场（RBC Capital Markets）近日在发给记者的报告中写道，随着OPEC+准备进一步动用其剩余产能，10月出现地缘政治意外事件的风险也在持续上升。 “尽管今夏市场的主流观点一直围绕2025年第四季度原油供应过剩展开，但参与者需要开始将地缘政治冲突持续所引发的‘突发风险升级’纳入考量。 ”]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[科技与AI再次成为市场核心。
   
截至北京时间10月3日凌晨收盘，在美国政府关门悬而未决的背景下，美股仍略微收涨，而中概股异军突起，人工智能（AI）概念股大涨，尤其是中国云服务商和AI数据中心概念股，港股亦在10月2日大涨，恒生指数一举突破27000点大关。
多位华尔街交易员和港股策略师对第一财经表示，科技与AI再次成为市场核心，恒生科技指数在南下资金因黄金周假期缺席的情况下依然大涨（部分受三星 、SK海力士、OpenAI 合作带来的兴奋情绪推动）。因此，这波强势主要是由海外资金驱动。高盛交易台的信息显示，随着A股市场休市，成交额出现预期中的回落。主要空头仓位上涨1.9%，几乎与恒指涨幅一致，说明是真实买盘而非空头回补。
截至北京时间收盘，标普500指数涨0.06%，纳斯达克指数涨0.3%，道琼斯工业指数涨0.17%。就在美中概股的表现来看，受益于云服务主题的科网巨头阿里巴巴大涨3.59%，百度涨2.03%；受益于数据中心概念的万国数据（GDS）和世纪互联（VNET）分别涨2.78%和4.46%。当日，上述个股涨幅显然超出美国AI概念股，英伟达涨0.88%，甲骨文跌0.08%，博通涨1.44%，美国科技七巨头涨跌不一。

中国科网巨头受益于云业务
“10月第一个交易日，美股芯片设备股大涨，Sora2也是驱动力之一，这显然带动了第二天的港股交易。今年国庆和去年一样，资金拉高港股，有望带动A股节后高开。”资深全球宏观基金经理袁玉玮对第一财经表示。
早在9月中旬时第一财经就报道，美资对中国股市兴趣回升，继年初的“DeepSeek时刻”后，中国科网巨头迎估值重估2.0。阿里、腾讯、百度等科技股大涨，阿里的在美中概股年初以来涨幅高达123%，近期更是从7月的100美元附近飙升至190美元附近；百度在美中概股今年以来的涨幅也达到约66%。二者在港股的涨幅类似。
近期，关于加大AI基础设施投资、自研先进芯片（如百度的昆仑系列）取得进展，以及AI大模型达到全球竞争水平的消息，都进一步激发了投资者的兴奋情绪。
美国资管公司Amont Partners董事总经理李肇宇 （Rob Li）此前对第一财经分析称：“中国科技股整体肯定是比美国便宜很多，所以会有押注‘追赶行情’的快钱进来；在中美元首通话背景下，市场情绪修复；此外，美联储重启降息周期，在弱美元背景下，新兴市场迎来资金回流，而中国股市也是新兴市场中流动性最好的市场。所以三个因素加起来，短期肯定有正面影响的。”
中国数据中心概念受追捧
除了科网股持续受到追捧，近期数据中心概念明显再度启动。由于中国三大云服务提供商（BAT）大力投入AI领域资本开支，BAT也是数据中心公司的主要客户，BAT的资本开支增加使得数据中心提供商成为了最大受益方。
华尔街投行杰富瑞（Jefferies）认为，世纪互联 、万国数据是最大受益方，也仍是该机构的首选投资标的，二者近期是涨势靠前的中概股。
据第一财经了解，美资公募基金今年以来对中国数据中心概念有所布局。
高盛在客户会上提及，在相对平静的第二季度后，万国数据和世纪互联股价回暖，展望突然变得更积极。“世纪互联在我们的亚洲领导者大会上做了演讲，表示看到需求复苏的高度可见性，将在8月开始显现，随后上周又宣布了一笔40兆瓦的批发订单。受近期甲骨文新闻影响，两者的买盘均明显增加。”
中国数据中心公司增长前景如何？高盛提及，世纪互联管理层指出，自8月底以来已有3个每个容量在50-100兆瓦的新项目向不止一个客户公开招标，尤其是来自互联网垂直领域的龙头公司。因此，管理层有信心2025财年第三季度的订单量可以超过2025财年第二季度的水平，并有望接近 2025财年第一季度的水平；万国数据的管理层向来更保守，他们的管理层并不预计在第三、四季度会出现大订单（100+兆瓦），但他们仍然预计中国的芯片客户会大规模购买新芯片。
上述客户结构有何不同？万国数据在批发业务上的暴露更多，其国内业务中阿里占比20%-30%，其次是腾讯和字节跳动，各占15%-20%，随后是金山云和百度；世纪互联几乎过去一直是零售数据中心运营商，零售仍占 EBITDA（即息税折旧摊销后利润）约50%，但在批发业务中，字节跳动是最大的客户且其份额在增长。
港股、A股升势有望维持
事实上，下半年以来，A股、港股、美股都围绕着AI这一主线进行交易，因而互相联动明显，而各界预计这一趋势将持续。
建银国际首席港股策略师赵文利对第一财经表示，港股随着三季度恒指突破并站稳25000点关键分水岭，港股一二级市场良性循环进一步强化，牛市格局已基本确立。
在他看来，四季度将是港股夯实新一轮牛市基础、打开上行空间的关键阶段，主要影响因素和事件窗口包括：中美谈判进展及APEC峰会元首互动；美联储后续降息的节奏及力度；市场对中国经济韧性、人民币汇率和企业盈利前景的再评估以及关注 DeepSeek R2或其他新版本潜在发布计划等。
潜在的风险在于，美联储重启降息已充分反映，但后续降息路径及空间，特别是2026年，仍存高度不确定性。美元走势或短期震荡，中期承压，长期走弱。建银国际港股流动性领先指标暗示未来9个月，恒指或震荡寻顶。赵文利预计， 四季度港股走势或先抑后扬，恒生指数波动区间介于24800-27800点，科技指数介于5800-6800点。
积极的因素在于，当前国际投资者对A股、港股的兴趣高涨，“是否具有可投资性（investability）”这类前两年时常出现的质疑今年几乎绝迹。
瑞银投资银行中国股票策略研究主管王宗豪对第一财经称，“我们在美国和亚洲开展多次路演，投资者对中国股票的兴趣浓厚，越来越多的投资者认同我们对市场更乐观的展望。”
尽管如此，他也提及，一些投资者感到些许不安。不过，考虑到强劲的走势和散户资金的潜在流入，瑞银不认为这些投资者愿意在短期内减持其中国仓位。此外，投资者也对中国的AI、技术发展和资本回报发展感兴趣。
目前，许多国际投资者仍暂将中国视为战术性交易机会。在亚洲，投资者的情绪更加乐观，一些投资者看到新基金发行的机会。]]></content>

This year’s Revivals section spotlights a hidden classic by a major modern filmmaker, whose new movie is equally great.

When I’m looking at what’s on offer in the Revivals section of the New York Film Festival—and, for that matter, whenever I see a noteworthy retrospective coming to one of the city’s repertory houses—I think of these screenings not as conserving cinema’s past but, rather, as safeguarding its future. The vital thing about the history of this art form is its creative power, its ability to energize filmmakers of later generations and inspire movies to come. In that regard, one of the major events of this year’s festival is the world première of a restoration of Mary Stephen’s film “Ombres de Soie” (“Shades of Silk”), from 1978.
“Shades of Silk” was Stephen’s first feature, and it remains a tour de force of form, style, and historical imagination. In her mid-twenties when she made the film, Stephen was born in Hong Kong to a Chinese family who immigrated to Montreal in 1967. She made a few short films in Canada and then, in the mid-seventies, got a grant to study film in Paris, where she made “Shades.” The film was shot cheaply—in 16-mm., with a tiny crew and Stephen herself playing one of the main characters. But the result could not be further from the familiar rawness of independent filmmaking. In a spare sixty-two minutes of sinuously elegant images and alluring surfaces, it unfolds a narrative that spans continents and decades.




The story is one of impossible love, centering on two young Chinese women, high-school best friends in Shanghai in the nineteen-twenties whose relationship has an intense erotic current continuing into adulthood. In 1934, Lysanne (played by Alexandria Brouwer) is living in Paris and writes to her friend Marlène (played by Stephen), who’s studying at Wellesley, imploring her to transfer to a university in Paris. There are glimpses of the life they shared, but Lysanne’s pleas are in vain. Desperate for Marlène, she has a nervous breakdown, and goes to stay with her mother, who now lives in the colony of French Indochina. Once there, Lysanne marries a rich young man. Marlène is invited to the wedding, attends, and puts up a good front for as long as she can, until the sociable façade shatters, with tragic consequences.
A crucial aspect of modern cinema is that, pace so-called experimental filmmaking, it doesn’t reject stories but explicitly foregrounds the ways that stories are told—often by way of a daringly oblique or distant connection between a narrative and the images and performances that conjure it. “Shades” opens with an epigram taken from Marguerite Duras’s script for Alain Resnais’s “Hiroshima Mon Amour” (1959), and Duras gradually emerges as a presence looming over Stephen’s film. Although best known as a novelist, Duras achieved prominence as a filmmaker in the nineteen-seventies, and her 1975 film “India Song” was Stephen’s key inspiration for “Shades,” which is in conspicuous dialogue with the earlier film. Common to both are a depiction of romance in colonial settings, ballroom-dance scenes, and a plot set forth largely in voice-over—including, in “Shades,” the letters the women write and an omniscient narrator. But Stephen’s film, while seeming to partake of Duras’s world, also reënvisions that world. Duras was born in French Indochina, near what is now Ho Chi Minh City, in 1914, and spent much of her youth there, not moving to France permanently until 1933, to attend university there. Stephen—unlike Duras, whose family was white and from France—grew up experiencing the tensions of colonialism from the other side, as an ethnically Chinese subject of British rule. In “Shades,” the restlessness, the sense of a home that’s merely conditional, suggests the social and political pressures of living in a land that both is and isn’t one’s own—of living with cultural hierarchies both public and internalized and negotiating relationships (including romantic ones) with the colonizers.

Stephen evokes life among the colonized not only in the film’s story but also in its form. The action is largely desynchronized, the activities onscreen contrasting with the voice-over narrations, with the effect of destabilizing the present tense of the movie, imbuing it with nostalgia and with longing for possible futures. Stephen depicts the women’s schooltime bond in hypnotic flashbacks, and their separation largely through absence itself, with gliding, pensive shots of places—rooms, buildings, streets—where the women have been and may be again but which, onscreen, are vacant. Stephen, despite filming in Paris on a minuscule budget, achieves an uncanny evocation of Asia and of the past. She even bounces the time frame of the story off the time in which she made the film: Lysanne’s wedding banquet, shown in dramatic fragments, is amplified with a series of still photographs of a contemporary banquet that visually echoes the one in the story while also wrenching it out of its fictional framework. There’s something timeless about “Shades”: it’s anchored in the mid-nineteen-thirties, it shows the twenties, it was made in 1978; it harmonizes stylistically with several masterworks of its own time but is so evocative of the past and so aesthetically and thematically advanced that it seems to inhabit a zone outside chronology. It is as if the film is somehow displaced and distant from itself.


It makes sense that Stephen, as a filmmaker of absences, has made a major career as a film editor—notably, on the films of Éric Rohmer, with whom she worked briefly soon after making “Shades,” and then steadily from 1991 until his last film, in 2007. Editors are the cinema’s taker-outers, and they create several kinds of absence: some removals merely eliminate, whereas others generate, organizing what’s there to conjure all the more powerfully what isn’t. With “Shades,” Stephen extends and expands the connection of drama and form in ways that offer exemplary lessons to filmmakers today.





The screenings of “Shades” at the New York Film Festival coincide with a retrospective of Stephen’s work at Metrograph. Along with “Shades” and some of her short films, it includes her remarkable new feature, “Palimpsest: The Story of a Name.” The movie is a personal documentary in the form of a quest to find out how Stephen, despite being Chinese, ended up with an English surname. It is centered on her late parents, Henry and Hilda Stephen, and tracks the complex journeys that marked their lives. They met in Hong Kong, but Henry wasn’t from there, and their life of travel reflected an era of political crises in Asia, including Japan’s military conquests of the nineteen-thirties and its occupation of Hong Kong during the Second World War. Stephen’s parents, who were businesspeople, appear to have inspired the filmmaker’s gifts through their avocations: Hilda was a published poet, and Henry was an amateur filmmaker who left both a copious record of home movies and a heroically large set of autobiographical journals and family chronicles. Stephen’s storytelling here is as richly detailed and as startlingly creative and multilayered as it is in “Shades of Silk,” while also wry and playful, conveying the warmth and occasional strangeness of family ties along with the imaginative implications of family lore. I’m glad that “Palimpsest” is screening at Metrograph, but I wish it had the more prominent showcase of the N.Y.F.F. I’ve seen many good new movies at the festival, and Stephen’s new one is their equal.
Another N.Y.F.F. revival, “The Wife of Seisaku,” from 1965, brings an important episode of history passionately and intimately to life. The director is Yasuzô Masumura, several of whose films—such as “Giants and Toys,” “Black Test Car,” and “Red Angel”—are among the treasures of Japanese cinema. Masumura’s career was long and extensive, with some sixty features appearing between 1957 and his death, in 1986, at the age of sixty-two. However, few of his films are available in the U.S., and the restoration of “The Wife of Seisaku” is an exemplary introduction to his scathing work. It’s set in a remote Japanese village around the time of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05. A woman named Okane (Ayako Wakao) returns to the village, having been the concubine of a successful businessman who died suddenly and left her a substantial bequest. She moves in with her mother and takes in her ne’er-do-well brother but is scorned and shunned by the rest of the village because of her past. Then a young man named Seisaku (Takahiro Tamura), who has been away on military service, comes back to the village where his girlfriend, Oshina (Yuka Konno), awaits him. He arrives full of patriotic spirit, eagerly arousing martial pride among the villagers, but he has little patience with their ostracism of Okane. His sympathy for her soon turns into love, and he defies the community to marry her. But war breaks out and he’s drafted back into service. Okane is desperate at the prospect of losing both her true love and her one defender, and her desperation gives rise to extravagant and harrowing drama.
Masumura is a caustic critic of Japanese nationalism and militarism, lampooning their pomposity and vanity and deriding what he sees as the narrow moralism of his country’s tradition-bound social order. In this regard, his work stands alongside that of such elder directors as Kenji Mizoguchi and Yasujiro Ozu. But Masumura’s manner is raw and harsh, a cinematic parallel to pulp fiction, with intense emotional and physical violence, candid and heated eroticism, hectic performances, and luridly skewed visual compositions. (His closest Hollywood counterpart would be Robert Aldrich, best known for such furious movies as “Kiss Me Deadly” and “What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?”) “The Wife of Seisaku” is filmed in black-and-white wide-screen format, and its asymmetrical images and distorting angles befit Masumura’s furious, sardonic, yet fervently open-minded world view, and his debunking of the pious myths of history. ♦]]></content>

The President learned in 2019 how to undercut Congress in a funding fight, and he’s been making the same move ever since.

Ever since Newt Gingrich brought the federal government to a halt for three weeks in 1995, “birthing a new era of American gridlock,” as NPR later put it, the shutdown has been one of the capital’s recurring set pieces. Republicans, as the official anti-government party going back to the Reagan era, have usually been blamed. Maybe that’s why Democrats are charging ahead this time. Party leaders on Capitol Hill are calling the partial closure of the government that began at midnight on Wednesday “the Trump shutdown” and claiming that they have no choice but to stand up to an “erratic and unhinged” President in order to protect health-care subsidies that are about to expire for millions of Americans. With Republicans in charge of the White House and both houses of Congress, initial polls suggest that the public is inclined to pin responsibility on the G.O.P. once again.
To which I’d suggest: Be careful what you wish for. What looks like good politics might also prove to be another step in the undoing of the Constitution’s checks and balances.




During Donald Trump’s first term, the President’s demand that Congress fund his proposed wall on the Mexican border led to the longest shutdown in history—thirty-five days, from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019. In the end, Trump caved, agreeing to reopen the government even without the nearly six billion dollars in border-wall funding that he had demanded.


This capitulation was initially portrayed as a triumph for the new Democratic majority under House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a stinging defeat for Trump, with headlines such as “Trump Relents on Wall” (Politico), “Trump Concedes” (CNN), and “Trump Is Down, but Not Out” (New York Post)—but it was not. It was, in fact, a moment of revelation in which he realized that he could do just about anything he wanted. In the end, Trump got his border-wall money. He simply went ahead and took it. The history of the Presidency may never be the same.
With the encouragement of the same radical advisers, such as Stephen Miller and Russell Vought, who are at the center of the action today, Trump declared a national emergency at the border, thus creating a pretext for grabbing the funds that he wanted from the military construction budget and other programs. Even some Republicans called this a blatant abuse of power, but, when Democrats and a number of institutionalist holdouts in the G.O.P. joined together to pass a bill meant to bar Trump from seizing the money without congressional authorization, Trump successfully vetoed it. Instead of checking Trump’s power play, Congress proved to be incapable of stopping it.
At least in Trump 1.0, the emergency decree was a one-off response to a specific funding fight with Congress. In his second term, Trump has learned to wield the emergency pen as if it is a magic wand granting him unlimited powers. It’s his template, his new default setting. And the Republican-led Congress has stood by and let it happen. Since returning to the White House in January, he’s declared no fewer than ten emergencies, related to the southern border (again), domestic energy, international trade, illegal drugs, and crime in Washington, D.C. “If I have a national emergency, I can keep the troops there as long as I want,” he said in September, referring to the National Guard troops he ordered into the streets of the capital. Lawsuits are pending on this and many of Trump’s other sweeping assertions of executive authority. But unless the Supreme Court acts decisively to stop him—increasingly a dubious proposition—Trump will continue to use such pretexts to take dramatic actions that our narrowly divided national legislature would almost certainly never approve, such as imposing sweeping tariffs on America’s largest trading partners, militarizing the southern border, and even declaring a “national emergency” with regards to Brazil because he did not like the prosecution of its Trump-aligned former President, Jair Bolsonaro.

The Trump 1.0 shutdown, in other words, was the precursor event for the Trump 2.0 power grab. So no wonder that Trump is going big with this shutdown: as far as he’s concerned, there’s only upside. Who knows what additional authority he’ll have seized from Congress by the time it’s over?
It did not take long for Trump’s maximalist plans to become evident. On Wednesday, hours after the shutdown began, Vought announced that he would use it as the rationale for shutting off billions of dollars in funding for federally approved projects in an array of Democratic-majority states. In New York, home to both the Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, and his House counterpart, Hakeem Jeffries, Vought targeted a roughly eighteen-billion-dollar plan for infrastructure work, including the long-promised Hudson River rail-tunnel project. (His stated reason was that the project was compromised by “unconstitutional D.E.I. principles,” leading to a uniquely Trump-era question: Is there such a thing as a woke tunnel?) Later on Wednesday, Vought broadened the attack, saying that he would cancel another nearly eight billion dollars, affecting a dozen more Democratic states, in unspecified cuts to climate projects, or, as he put it in a social-media post, “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”
Republicans on Capitol Hill warned their Democratic counterparts that all this and more would rain down on them and their constituents unless they folded. Vought had, after all, signalled as much in a memo last month directing federal agencies to prepare for widespread layoffs in the event of a shutdown. “President Trump is going to use that as an opportunity not to tell people you’re furloughed for a few days, but instead to send pink slips and to get rid of left-wing bureaucrats who are imposing left-wing priorities that are contrary to President Trump’s priorities,” Ted Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas, said in a Fox Business interview with Trump’s first-term economic adviser Larry Kudlow. Cruz, something of a shutdown expert since he personally drove one in 2013 as part of a failed effort to undercut Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, added, “I think that is fantastic.”





Not all Republicans agreed, but their bleats of complaint hardly suggested a Congress that had finally found the moment to reassert its institutional prerogatives. “Russ is less politically in tune than the President,” Kevin Cramer, a Republican senator for North Dakota, told the news outlet Semafor on Wednesday. “We, as Republicans, have never had so much moral high ground on a government-funding bill in our lives. . . . I just don’t see why we would squander it, which I think is the risk of being aggressive with executive power in this moment.”
By Thursday morning, Trump had an answer: Democrats had presented him with an “unprecedented opportunity” to expand his reach, and of course he would take it. If Cramer or anyone else is surprised that Trump would adopt the most aggressive view possible of executive power, well, they shouldn’t be. In a post on his Truth Social site, Trump announced that he would meet with Vought soon to determine not whether to start slashing the government but “which of the many Democrat Agencies” to target and by how much. How much clearer does it have to be that the President, rather than seeking a way out of the impasse, is looking to benefit from it? His offer to the Democrats right now can be summed up as nothing more than the demand of a hostage-taker: stop me before I cut again.
Some senior government officials in Trump’s own executive branch, according to the Washington Post on Thursday, have privately warned that large-scale layoffs now could be illegal. Such layoffs would also be an unprecedented response to a shutdown. But this is Trump 2.0; where another President might hear words such as “illegal” and “unprecedented” as a warning sign, for Trump they are practically an invitation to act. He hardly needs an invitation, anyway. The mood in the Oval Office today when it comes to constraints of any kind can be best summed up by a photo that Trump posted of his pre-shutdown meeting on Monday with Democratic leaders, complete with two strategically placed TRUMP 2028 hats sitting atop the Resolute desk. Subtle, he’s not. There’s a theme here to his entire second term: the Constitution—what’s that? ♦]]></content>

• Ann Patchett on travel and mortality
• Bill and Ted pull off a pretty excellent “Waiting for Godot”
• Listening to Taylor Swift in prison




David Remnick
Editor, The New Yorker





In a few weeks, leading voices from the worlds of politics, movies, literature, and comedy will take the stage at The New Yorker Festival, our annual weekend of interviews, performances, screenings, and more. Guests this year will include Salman Rushdie, Emma Thompson, Christopher Guest, Jamaica Kincaid, Ken Jennings—and, we hope, you.
This year’s Festival will take place between October 24th and 26th, and marks a special milestone. All year, The New Yorker has been celebrating its hundredth anniversary, a landmark we’ve honored with special issues, events, and more.
Our 2025 lineup features a remarkable array of writers, artists, and experts in the news and culture of our moment. Jamaica Kincaid and the longtime staff writer Ian Frazier will reflect on how they capture the world through language, one of a series of events with such authors as Percival Everett, Ocean Vuong, George Saunders, and Zadie Smith. (Many events are sold out, but there’s still time to join the wait list.) Demi Moore, Emma Thompson, and Noah Baumbach will illuminate the craft of filmmaking in interviews hosted by the staff members Jia Tolentino, Helen Shaw, and Susan Morrison. And the magazine itself will come under scrutiny during the New York première of “The New Yorker at 100,” an upcoming Netflix documentary produced by Judd Apatow and directed by the Academy Award winner Marshall Curry, who will appear in conversation afterward with the staff writer Jelani Cobb.
From the world of reporting, the staff writers Larissa MacFarquhar, Rebecca Mead, Ian Parker, Kelefa Sanneh, and Michael Schulman will gather to discuss the art of the profile, a process through which they’ve produced enduring portraits—and, on occasion, sensational scoops. In the legal realm, the former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who resigned rather than defend Donald Trump’s so-called Muslim ban, will join the staff writers Jeannie Suk Gersen, Ruth Marcus, and Amy Davidson Sorkin to consider the embattled state of the American justice system. At “Recalibrating for the Digital Age,” the writers Charles Duhigg, Cal Newport, and Anna Wiener will examine the potential of A.I. and other technology to make our lives better.
As always, there will be much more: musical performances, a podcast taping, even a trivia showdown between New Yorker writers and editors. The events reflect the breadth and depth we strive for in every issue, that unmistakable mix of seriousness, curiosity, and pleasure. I hope to see you at the Festival.

How Bad Is It?

Earlier this week, a federal judge issued a ruling in American Association of University Professors et al. v. Marco Rubio, which challenged the Administration’s campaign to arrest, detain, and plan to deport pro-Palestinian student protesters and advocates. The Trump Administration plans to appeal the decision.
What does it mean?
“Tucked deep in Judge William Young’s ruling is an extraordinary observation: a President who so flagrantly allows his subordinates to violate the First Amendment is in violation of his oath of office and his duty to faithfully execute the laws.
The judge also said that he has no authority to control Presidential behavior. But, during the remedy phase of the case, which is the next step, I imagine he’ll have leeway to craft a solution—and prevent those subordinates from using immigration laws to suppress speech the President doesn’t like.”

Published
2 October 2025




For a long time, the history of tiny Ladakh - a stunning region popular with tourists, nestled high in the Himalayas - has been shaped by notions of spirituality, mysticism and a sense of otherworldliness.
But now, its fabled tranquillity has been shattered by deadly violence.
Protests for greater autonomy from India erupted last week and spiralled into clashes between crowds and police in which four civilians were killed and at least 80 injured.
Police arrested Sonam Wangchuk, a prominent scientist and activist who has been at the forefront of protests, alleging he had incited a mob with provocative speeches, a charge he denies. More protesters were then detained as authorities cut internet services, imposed a curfew in the picturesque capital Leh and sent in paramilitary troops.
The discontent in Ladakh is not new, but the violence - the deadliest there for decades - was.
Sandwiched between China to the east and Pakistan to the west, the disputed region with a rich Buddhist past used to be a part of Indian-administered Kashmir, before Delhi split the region and imposed direct rule in 2019.
Since 2021, residents have led a peaceful movement seeking statehood, job quotas and special status for Ladakh, which they say is essential to preserve their distinct identity and culture. 
"What we saw is the result of years of anger and frustration that has been building up," said one local woman, Jigna, whose real name has been changed to protect her identity.
"It's high time people paid attention to what we want."

The exact sequence of events last week is still not clear but protesters told the BBC that on 24 September, thousands of people had gathered peacefully in a public park to support Wangchuk and others, who had been on a hunger strike for two weeks.
"At some point, a chunk of people, especially youngsters, walked away from the venue and started a protest rally. Then the violence broke out," said Gelek Phunchok, a businessman who was there.
Dozens were injured and an office of India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was set on fire in the unrest.
Police say they responded to the violence by opening fire, but protesters deny this. An inquiry led by a magistrate is currently under way.
A lot of restrictions have since been eased - but fear, mistrust and a deep sense of foreboding still grip Leh.

With its soaring mountains and lakes, Ladakh has long been a major draw for visitors


Authorities have asked people to stay vigilant against "the anti-social and anti-national elements attempting to disturb harmony", further souring sentiments among the locals.
Political and defence experts have expressed caution, saying any escalation would only alienate people, posing serious risks for India's national security.
"Ladakh is a highly sensitive region, sharing borders with both of India's rivals - China and Pakistan. We need to make sure that this area remains stable," says Lt Gen Deependra Singh Hooda, who headed the Indian army's Northern Command from 2012-2016.
The region was the site of deadly border clashes between India and China in 2020, and also includes Kargil, where India and Pakistan fought a short war in 1999.
"Ladakhis have traditionally supported the army but narratives branding them anti-nationals could change things," said Lt Gen Hooda.
But for some, reconciliation may no longer be an option.
Several protesters the BBC spoke to said they do not support "violence in any form and would continue to oppose it".
But what happened, they add, cannot be ignored either. "People have all kinds of romanticised ideas about Ladakh. But beyond the beauty, the region is a complex patchwork of cultures and identities, each with its own unique history," said Jigna.

Activist Sonam Wangchuk has been accused of instigating violence - a charge he denies 


Ladakh's 300,000 people are almost equally made up of Muslims and Buddhists. The Leh region is dominated by Buddhists - predominantly tribespeople - while Kargil is inhabited by Muslims.
Historically, the Buddhist community has demanded a separate region for its people, and those in Kargil have wanted to be integrated with Muslim-majority Indian-administered Kashmir.
In 2019, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked Article 370 of the constitution which accorded special status, including land and job rights, to the former state of Jammu and Kashmir, residents in Ladakh were initially jubilant.
They hoped the decision would allow them more autonomy in their culture and spur economic development in the remote region. But as time passed, many began to feel disillusioned saying the benefits never reached them.

Residents like Deskit Angmo say promises were broken and locals feel cheated 


With the special status gone, the autonomy of hill councils - that were formed in the 1990s to give residents a greater say in local politics - began to wane. The changes also allowed non-residents to buy land and property in the region. 
People who once supported the government now accused it of throwing open the region to "industrialists and capitalists" and making them vulnerable to demographic changes.
"We felt cheated. We were promised that our land, jobs and cultural identity will be protected but this was a lie," said Diskit Gangjor, secretary of the women's wing of the Ladakh Buddhist Association (LBA), an organisation leading the protests.
As anger grew, residents from Kargil and Leh joined hands and sought full statehood for their region.

Other demands included adding Ladakh to a list, known as the Sixth Schedule, that guarantees protections to land and a nominal degree of autonomy to tribal areas under the constitution, along with a parliamentary seat each for Leh and Kargil districts.
Over the years, Ladakh's main advocacy groups held several rounds of talks with the federal home ministry, but failed to make any progress.
In the meantime, unemployment soared in the region, making its young people increasingly more frustrated. 
It was in this context that Wangchuk and others began their protest last month. 
"What happened on 24 September wasn't just about that single day. It can't be understood in isolation - you have to look at where this frustration is coming from," says Nardon Shunu, a women's rights activist.
The BBC has contacted Ladakh's director general of police and other senior officials for comment.
Since Wangchuk's arrest, the region's main civil society groups have withdrawn from dialogue with the federal government.
Protesters say that even though their most vocal leader has been detained, they will continue their struggle peacefully.
"What we are doing is not anti-national. These are our genuine demands and we will achieve our goal peacefully," Phunchok, the businessman, said.
For now, the road to peace looks uncertain.
Hundreds of soldiers have been guarding the protest site - one of Leh's main public parks - since last week. Protesters say they want to resume their movement, but don't know when that'll happen. Many of them have gone icognito fearing reprisals.
"What happened that day [on the day of clashes] felt was chaos of another level," said Phunchok. " It will take a long time to recover from it."

The Russian president’s speech "proves the point that Vladimir Putin continues to be the adult in the room," military analyst and former US Marine Corps intelligence officer Scott Ritter told Sputnik.


"He has a very mature, a very balanced approach, one that emphasizes non-violent solutions to problems, de-emphasizes conflict, and yet retains the reality of Russian resolve that Russia will not yield, will not bend will not collapse and will not run away from threats to its security," Ritter stresses.  

Putin's calm and confident manner is "a very effective counter to the panic and Russophobia-induced terror that is running rampant in Europe and the US today," the pundit says.  


Putin's Message to the World  



It is imperative that Russia define its values and principles – an important message to world leaders 

"Europe right now is in the grips of irrationality," but in the US "it's not quite that bad" Ritter argues, and Putin's words can be heard.  



Europe Fanning Flames of Ukraine Conflict


"The expansion of NATO, the expansion of the European Union to the detriment of Russia has been Europe's policy posture for decades now," Ritter points out.  







Europe worked with the US to overthrow the legitimate Ukrainian government in 2014 

Europe did not negotiate the Minsk agreement to stop the Ukrainian war on Donbass in good faith 

The EU derailed the Istanbul peace negotiations in March and April 2022 

Europe continues to provide Ukraine with weapons and cash 

Europe used Ukraine as its proxy to fight and weaken Russia  


"So Europe is responsible. The Russian president is 100% correct," Ritter says. "Much of what defines Europe today, both the NATO military alliance and the European Union is predicated on the necessity of having Russia as an enemy, as Russia as an opponent that justifies expenses and policies."]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[After almost a week of regular demonstrations, protests in Morocco turned violent, resulting in hundreds injured and two deaths. Who's behind the protests, what are they demanding, and where might this end?  
    Thousands of young Moroccans have been demonstrating for better healthcare and education almost daily  Image: Abdel Majid Bziouat/AFP/Getty Images   
Since last week, the streets of the Moroccan capital Rabat have been unusually quiet. This is because in the early evening, the city center turns into an arena for demonstrations led by an anonymous collective known as GenZ 212.
The name Gen Z indicates the age of the protesters, who are mostly in their teens or twenties, and the numbers 212 are Morocco's dialing prefix.
The protests started small on September 27, but gradually grew to include working-class neighborhoods throughout Rabat. It then spread to Morocco's biggest cities, including Casablanca and Agadir, and then to smaller towns, too.
Recently, they have become violent. Morocco's Interior Ministry reported that as a result of violence earlier this week, over 400 people had been arrested, 263 security officers injured, and 142 of their vehicles damaged. A further 20 privately-owned cars were also damaged and 23 civilians injured, the ministry said.
Two people were killed on October 1, after police fired at protesters in the southern town of Lqliaa, reportedly in self-defense, Morocco's state news agency reported.


How did protests start?
The group GenZ 212 first called for protests around a month ago, on its eponymous server on the social platform Discord. It called for young people to protest on September 27 and 28, to demand their right to better health services and education, and to denounce what have been described as misplaced political priorities.
Huge amounts of public money have been invested into football stadiums in Morocco that will be used for various tournaments, including the 2026 Africa Cup of Nations in December and the FIFA World Cup in 2030. But at the same time, local schools and hospitals remain underfunded.
In mid-September, around the time as the original GenZ 212 group founded its Discord server, rights groups and locals staged protests in front of a regional hospital in Agadir following the deaths of up to eight women — including several who were pregnant — under questionable circumstances.
At first it wasn't clear whether GenZ 212's calls to demonstrate would be heeded. But small demonstrations did occur on September 27, and then continued to grow. The group then decided to organize daily protests. This has resulted in some of the largest anti-government protests in Morocco in years.


Moroccans aged between 15 and 34 make up around 30% of the whole population. Although GenZ 212 has not made jobs a major demand, the Gen Z age group is overrepresented in unemployment statistics, with around 37% of Moroccans aged between 15 and 24 currently without a job. In cities, the unemployment rate for this age group goes up to around 48%.
On Tuesday, October 1, the protests became violent for the first time, with demonstrators seen confronting Moroccan security services, setting cars and shops on fire, smashing windows, and throwing rocks.


Who are GenZ 212?
The group is "purely a product of the internet," Moroccan political analyst Rachid Belghiti told DW Arabic. "It has no traditional organizational structure, and no known leadership."
That makes it different from previous anti-government protests in Morocco, Belghiti noted, including the so-called February 20 Movement, a pro-democrary protest movement that was part of the Arab Spring demonstrations of 2011. The breakout of those protests in 2011 led Morocco's King Mohammed VI  to announce a referendum on a new constitution.
"The February 20 movement had a primary political demand: reform of state structures, a complete separation of powers, and the establishment of a parliament that would exercise real powers," Belghiti explained. "Whereas the current demands of the Gen Z movement are more general and are characterized by a kind of political romanticism."

How has the Moroccan government responded?
At first, government-affiliated media outlets didn't pay the youth protests much attention. Some officials uploaded messages to Facebook or YouTube in which they defended the government, criticized the protesters — there were even suggestions that the protests were driven by "foreign actors" — or urged restraint. 
However, since then, official statements have become much more conciliatory.
On Tuesday, September 30, the government issued a statement: "After reviewing various developments related to youthful expressions in electronic and public spaces, the government emphasizes it is listening and it understands these social demands," the statement said, before emphasizing that the way forward must be based on dialogue.
The statement also said that the government was aware of problems within the local health system, and that it was working on other reforms that would empower local youth.
Fatima-Zahra Mansouri, Morocco's housing minister and the mayor of Marrakesh, described the protests as a form of "democratic vitality."
"We are not afraid of our youth," she said at a meeting earlier this week. "Protesting is legitimate, but we want it to remain within the law so that dialogue is possible."
During a live broadcast from inside parliament, Morocco's health minister, Amin Tehraoui, acknowledged chronic shortages within the national health system. He had previously dismissed the director of the Agadir hospital that had been the subject of protests earlier in September.

Opposition parties have also said that the government should respond to the protesters' demands. Some members of opposition parties even suggested that the government should step down over this. 
One notable absence among official sources responding to the protests is the country's billionaire Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch. As a result, Akhannouch has been the subject of much ridicule and criticism on social media platforms.
On social media, there are increasing calls for Morocco's King Mohammed VI to intervene in the face of what is perceived as the government's inefficacy.
Morocco has an elected parliament and is a constitutional monarchy. But in reality, it is the king, who's been on the throne for over 22 years now, who wields most political and economic power.
The GenZ 212 activists insist they're not targeting this system. "Our problem does not extend beyond the current government and its policies," one statement said. "Do not confuse criticism of the situation with rejection of the nation."


What next?
Moroccan analyst Belghiti believes that the authorities will continue using security forces to ensure they don't lose control of the protests. "That's the easy answer, one that preserves the current state and its policies," he explained.
However, he added, that won't change the things that got the young people protesting in the first place. The education and health sectors in Morocco are plagued by considerable structural problems, the kinds of issues that cannot be resolved quickly, and which profit-conscious politicians may not even care to resolve, he argued.
Should the youth-driven protests continue, or even grow larger, it's possible that Prime Minister Akhannouch might be pushed out of power, Belghiti suggested.
For now, the situation is still developing, the analyst cautioned.
In fact, other experts contacted by DW said there's not enough information available yet to make an informed prediction, especially as there have been loud calls for restraint and deescalation.

Violent protests in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir have left at least eight people dead, Pakistani officials confirmed on Thursday.
Control over the territory of Kashmir has been divided between Pakistan and India, which have disputed it since the two countries were formed in 1947.
The protest in Pakistan-administered Kashmir began on Monday, as thousands took to the streets of Muzaffarabad, the capital of the territory, to demand an end to lucrative benefits for the political class, such as free electricity and expensive cars.
Authorities blocked internet and mobile phone services. Officials also reportedly warned local media against covering the events.
According to AFP news agency reporters on the ground, streets were stained with blood and littered with spent bullet casings, shards of glass and scattered stones.
Three policemen and five civilians have been killed so far, according to two security officials who spoke to Reuters news agency. The officials confirmed that clashes had been ongoing since the protests began on Monday. 
Pakistani TV reported that businesses, schools and transportation services went on strike in response to the unrest.

Pakistani PM opens dialogue
Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif addressed the situation, offering to set up a committee of senior officials to resolve the conflict.
"The government is always ready to resolve the problems of our Kashmiri brothers," he said.
The committee would be responsible for investigating the violence that occurred and seeking dialogue with protesters, Sharif's office said in a press release.
The protests have been led by the Awami Action Committee (AAC), a civil rights organization formed to fight for local rights in the mostly rural, Muslim-majority region.
AAC protest leader Shaukat Nawaz said police had fired at protesters.
"The bullets being fired at us are made in Pakistan to be used against the enemy and are now being used against us," he said.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[數碼港成立全港首個無人機運動專用中心，有助港隊備戰全運會。

無人機踢足球，是今屆全運會其中一個群眾賽事，玩法是機及波合一，飛入對方這個圓形「龍門」，就算入球得分，每場三分鐘。

另一項就是無人機競速，在有限時間，穿過高高低低的障礙物，非常考這班「機師」的眼、手協調，慢些都「撞機」。

這裡是全港首個無人機運動專用中心，用作訓練和比賽場地。有即將出戰全運會的選手指，以往每逢周末到深圳練習，現時在香港練習可節省交通時間。場地雖然較小，但反而有好處。

無人機運動選手江小姐指出：「我們大部分練的都是反應，甚至一些技巧上的東西，小機的話技巧會更多，這個場地會讓我們練習很細緻的動作。同一時間，到內地比較大的場地集訓就容易適應。」

除了選手，公眾想用這個場地，也可跟數碼港一方預約，不過要有民航處的無人機飛行許可。

同日開幕還有低空經濟應用展示廳、財政司副司長黃偉綸、立法會議員葛珮帆，以及一帶一路國家領事代表等出席。

黃偉綸指首批38個的監管沙盒試點，已投入測試的項目，本月底將增至28個。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[熱帶風暴麥德姆明日進入本港800公里範圍內，天文台考慮明晚發出一號戒備信號，再評估需否在周六日間改發更高信號。

高空反氣旋正為華南帶來普遍晴朗天氣，多區氣溫晚上稍後回落，日間就曾升至33度以上，上水更高達36.4度。

不過要留意，位於菲律賓以東的熱帶風暴麥德姆，周五會橫過呂宋，稍後進入本港800公里範圍。預料向西北偏西移動，周末期間大致移向雷州半島至海南島東部一帶，並逐漸增強，但強度仍存在變數。天文台最快周五晚發出一號戒備信號。

天文台科學主任黃家興指出：「本港周六稍後至周日天氣會漸轉不穩，風勢頗大、海會有大浪及湧浪，間中亦會有狂風驟雨，因現時在菲律賓以東的西北太平洋該區的風切變較弱，而且海水溫度較高，未來一兩日均有利麥德姆的發展，受地形影響，有機會在經過呂宋時稍為減弱。」

天文台預計，麥德姆掠過後，下周一中秋節當日及翌日，廣東沿岸天色好轉，但與高空擾動相關的驟雨仍會影響該區。

澳門氣象局預計，麥德姆周五晚至周六初時進入澳門800公里範圍，屆時會發出一號風球。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[內地國慶中秋長假期第二日，截至晚上9時，有近21.5萬人次內地訪客入境，而第一日就有逾23萬人次。有旅遊業界指，不少旅客受盛事吸引來港，建議要推出更多元活動持續吸客。

旺角這間金舖，這兩天多了不少顧客，都是趁黃金周來港買金的內地旅客，飾金牌價衝破四萬二元一両，但黃金周首日銷售，仍然較去年十一有雙位數升幅。

貴州旅客袁女士說：「純粹喜歡，這個價位好像對我沒有(影響)，因為我不是買來增值的，因為香港的東西沒有假貨，這是我們內地人的想法。」

深圳旅客陳女士稱：「香港的匯率比內地相對划算一些，選品牌商相對會安心一些。」

一連八日國慶中秋假期。首日有逾23.2萬人次內地旅客抵港，較今年五一及去年十一假期，分別增長約半成。

有內地客指香港的吸引力，包括餐飲及文化，會留港四、五日。在油麻地警署這個熱門打卡點，要拍照，都要先排隊。

上海旅客逯小姐指出：「因為她(朋友)喜歡看港劇，然後我們就來到這裡打卡，吃到香港當地的美食是跟內地不一樣。」

北京旅客劉先生表示：「有朋友說十一期間來香港、澳門，其實價格應跟去外國差不多，後來覺得應該住在當地體驗當地文化，那怕稍為貴一些都要花這個錢。」

但仍有旅客選擇即日往返。

河北旅客馬先生稱：「我們是在深圳住，可能酒店價格比較貴，(來香港)主要是為了拍照。」

有旅遊業界指疫情後，政府及業界均集中向內地宣傳，加上盛事經濟見到成效，有信心達到八日，逾150萬人次內地客訪港的目標。

香港旅遊促進會總幹事崔定邦表示：「我們的煙花表演一定很號召力，緊接著隔一兩日，就有中秋綵燈會，見到旅客真的會因香港的盛事活動，或會跟隨有興趣的盛事活動而來，可能我們都要在中間，如十月三、四日都提供活動，令旅客有多些不同玩法，決定假期在香港留久些，就算過夜或再回來。」

他指酒店都沒有加很多房價，尖沙咀區加百分之5至10，不少酒店都爆滿。]]></content>

Greater Manchester Police (GMP) confirmed on Thursday evening that a man who drove a car into a crowd outside a busy synagogue earlier in the day, before stabbing two people to death and injuring four more, was a British citizen of Syrian origin.
Police said officers shot dead the suspected perpetrator outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in the suburb of Crumpsall, north of Manchester city center, and declared a "terrorist incident."
They said the attacker wore a "vest which had the appearance of an explosive device" but which turned out not to be functional.
GMP added that three more people have been arrested in connection with the attack, describing them as "two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s" who were in custody "on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism."
Officers confirmed that the two dead victims were Jewish, killed on Yom Kippur, the holiest holiday in the Jewish calendar.
Earlier on Thursday, Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor, head of specialist operations for London's Metropolitan Police, said police forces across the United Kingdom would be "stepping up controls" at synagogues, other Jewish sites and more generally to provide "reassurance" to those communities affected.
"We will ensure every piece of intelligence and line of inquiry is investigated," he said.
Starmer: Attack in Manchester 'absolutely shocking'

What happened during the Manchester synagogue attack?
Police declared a major incident at 9:37 a.m. local time (0837 GMT/UTC) outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in the north Manchester suburb of Crumpsall, and said that officers fired shots one minute later. 
GMP said paramedics were at the scene and that four members of the public had been injured, with both injuries caused "by the vehicle and stab wounds."

Police said they issued verbal warnings and fired warning shots, which the suspect did not heed, before shooting and disabling him.



Starmer 'appalled,' mayor urges people to avoid area
Prime Minister Keir Starmer, King Charles III and other political leaders all voiced outrage and sadness at the attack during the Jewish religious holiday Yom Kippur.
Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham told local BBC radio that it appeared to be a major event but also that "the immediate danger appears to be over."
Like the police, Burnham advised people to avoid the area as the emergency services respond.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he was appalled by the attack.
"I am appalled by the murderous attack near the Heaton Park Synagogue in Manchester on the morning of the holiest day for the Jewish people: Yom Kippur," Gideon Saar said on X.
Saar went on to accuse British authorities of failing to curb what he described as rising antisemitism in Britain: "The truth must be told: blatant and rampant antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement, as well as calls of support for terror, have recently become a widespread phenomenon in the streets of London, in cities across Britain, and on its campuses."
British Prime Minister Starmer also said the attack occurring on Yom Kippur made it particularly horrific.
"I'm appalled by the attack at a synagogue in Crumpsall," Starmer wrote online. "The fact that this has taken place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, makes it all the more horrific."



Starmer left a European summit in Denmark early to fly back to the UK to chair a so-called "COBRA" (Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms) meeting of committees coordinating the government response to national crises.
"I'm already able to say that additional police assets are being deployed to synagogues across the country and we will do everything to keep our Jewish community safe," Starmer said in Copenhagen before boarding his plane.
King Charles III said in a statement that he was "deeply shocked and saddened" by the attack, "especially on such a significant day for the Jewish community."
Manchester is home to roughly 30,000 Jewish people, making it the UK's second-largest Jewish community after London.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[October 3 is public holiday all over Germany commemorating the reunification of the once divided nation. But why was Germany divided in the first place? And when was it reunited? DW has the answers.
    Germany was officially reunited on October 3, 1990, and scores of people flocked to Berlin's Bundestag to celebrate this historic day Image: Jörg Schmitt/dpa/picture alliance    
Following the end of World War II in 1945, a defeated Germany was divided into four occupation zones, controlled by the Allied powers: the United States, France, Great Britain and the Soviet Union.
In 1949, two states emerged: the democratic Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) in the West, and the socialist German Democratic Republic (GDR) in the East, with the latter being under Soviet control. From that point on, Germany was divided.
Citizens of East Germany were only allowed to travel to the West under strict conditions. The GDR's borders were heavily guarded, and a massive wall was built around West Berlin, which belonged to the FRG, to prevent GDR citizens from leaving their country.

How did Germany's reunification come about?
People in the GDR lived in a surveillance state, deprived of freedom of expression. Those who failed to follow the socialist regime's line faced persecution and imprisonment.
By the late 1980s, the population was increasingly rising up against the government. Citizens longed for the freedom and democracy their neighbors in the Federal Republic of Germany enjoyed.
Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of reform were providing encouragement. Unlike his predecessors, Gorbachev refrained from using military force to suppress protest movements in the GDR and other Eastern Bloc countries.
In 1989, a wave of peaceful demonstrations swept across East German cities, eventually leading to the fall of the Berlin Wall. This cleared the way for reunification between East and West Germany.
Why is October 3 German Unity Day?
The opening of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, was the turning point for the path towards reunification.

Celebrating German Unity on that day might seem like the obvious choice.
But that particular date is more mired in tragedy than almost any other in German history. On the night of November 9 - 10, 1938, the Nazis burned down synagogues throughout Germany, destroyed Jewish businesses and homes, and murdered and arrested Jewish people. The "Reichspogromnacht" — also known as the November Pogroms and previously referred to as "Kristallnacht" — marked the beginning of the systematic persecution and mass murder of the Jews.
Because of that, overshadowing remembrance of that night by celebrating reunification was out of the question. October 3 was chosen for the new national holiday instead. On this day in 1990, reunification was formally completed, as it was date the GDR officially merged with the Federal Republic of Germany.


How do Germans celebrate Unity Day? 
The answer is: quite quietly. Those expecting fireworks and streets decked out in national colors could be disappointed. Nonetheless, almost every city hosts events, open houses and smaller celebrations.
In addition, each year on October 3 one of the federal states organizes a larger, official festival — typically in its state capital. The responsibility for hosting that falls to whichever state is currently chair of the Bundesrat — Germany's upper house of parliament.
2025 marks Saarland's turn. In the capital, Saarbrücken, the official program runs from October 2 to October 4 and promises "entertainment, art and culture, culinary specialties and tourism, as well as democratic exchange."

Most Germans, though, are simply happy to enjoy a day off.
Why is there no monument to reunification?
There was, in fact, supposed to be one long ago. Following almost 10 years of debate, on November 9, 2007, Germany's parliament — the Bundestag — decided to erect a "Monument to Freedom and Unity."
The idea was to install a 50-meter-long, walkable structure in front of the Humboldt Forum, in the center of Berlin. It was to be an interactive metaphor for democracy: When people stepped onto it, the platform would tilt in the direction the majority moved.
As of 2025, the monument has yet to materialize. Disputes between the companies commissioned to deliver it and the responsible government institutions have delayed construction. Whether and when a solution will be found remains uncertain. The pedestal for it, at least, is already in place.

Is today's Germany truly united?
Despite political efforts, a recent poll by German marketing institute Forsa indicates that Germany has yet to fully overcome its division.
Currently, only 35% of respondents say that East and West have "largely grown together." The respondents' different perceptions seem to confirm the divide: In the East, only 23% believe that Germans have become one people since 1990, compared to 37% in the West.
The sense of belonging reached its highest point in 2019, when 51% agreed that the two former countries had basically become one. When asked by the Infratest dimap political research institute what was still missing for successful reunification, the most frequent response by far — at 50% — was the equalization of wages, pensions and wealth.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Germany's men head to the European Team Championship of chess in Georgia with the wind in their sails. A rising star and a surprise late bloomer offer the European country hope but India remain a powerhouse.

Last month, Matthias Blübaum did something no other German chess player had in 35 years by qualifying for the World Championship Candidates Tournament. The 28-year-old did so by coming second at the FIDE Grand Swiss Tournament, held in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. This means he will be competing against seven other elite players for the right to take on current world champion Gukesh Dommaraju for the title.

In his run in Uzbekistan, Blübaum outshone many of the biggest names in chess, including the world champion and his highly touted Indian compatriots Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa and Erigaisi Arjun. Only the winner, the Netherlands' top-ranked player, Anish Giri, finished above the German.
Keymer thwarted
Germany's No. 1-ranked Vincent Keymer, who is seen as a possible future world champion, was held by Blübaum in the 10th round in Samarkand. 
"I had already played through the defeat against Vincent in my head. I was already frustrated," Blübaum told DW.
But that's not the way things turned out. On move 54, Keymer, in a clearly better position, overlooked a knight move and wound up having to settle for a draw. In the end, Keymer only managed fourth place.

"We are very proud of Matthias Blübaum," Ingrid Lauterbach, president of the German Chess Federation (DSB) told DW.
"Internationally, the German Chess Federation is more successful than it has been for a long time."
Back door qualification?
Keymer, 20, could also still slip into the Candidates Tournament through the back door. The top player in the world rankings who failed to qualify through one of the four qualifying tournaments is also granted a place. Keymer is currently in the top 10.
Blübaum's success now has the DSB looking to do more to support him in any way it can. As Lauterbach noted, until now Blübaum hasn't even enjoyed the guidance of a professional coach.

"We now have a good argument as we try to attract a new sponsor," she said.
Women trailing behind
While German men have been going from success to success in recent years, it's a very different story when it comes to the women, who trail far behind the leading nations, China and India.
"The German Chess Federation has neither a plan nor active resources to advance women's chess in Germany," long-time elite player Elisabeth Pähtz recently told the chess website "Chessbase."
DSB boss Lauterbach makes no bones about the fact that the German women are trailing behind the men, but she also points to one positive development — the hiring of a new women's national team coach, Ukrainian grandmaster, Zahar Efimenko.
"I hope that the new national coach will bring more stability to the team," she said.


The secret to success
The good news, according to Jacob Aargaard, is that "producing very good chess players is actually quite easy."
His formula: "You organize strong tournaments and give the talented players the resources to pay good coaches."
The Danish grandmaster is one of the world's leading coaches and has been following the upswing in German chess with great interest. He says that while there are other strong players besides Keymer and Blübaum, Germany doesn't have the depth of talent to keep up with the Indians.

This, he said, is at least in part because European chess officials tend to invest their resources in the federations instead of in the players.
"In India, there are many more talented individuals who are systematically promoted," Aargaard said.
Blübaum, though, notes that he did in fact receive strong support from the DSB as a young adult.
"Of course, there is more support in India, but that doesn't mean that if you grow up in Germany, you can't achieve just as well," he said.
The $75,000 (€64,000) in prize money he won in Samarkand will keep him going financially for now, as he focuses on building his team of helpers for the Candidates Tournament in six months' time.
"I need to ask people I think I can work well with," he said.
European Team Championship
The European Championship, which opens in Batumi, Georgia on Sunday, should be a good place to look for helpers. Germany, led by Keymer and Blübaum, enter the tournament as one the favorites.
In the absence of Russia, which left the European Chess Union in 2023 to avoid international sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, Germany's toughest opponents could be defending champions Serbia, France or the Netherlands.
"We are definitely a top team," Blübaum said. "Our goal must be to win gold."

Just over 50 years ago, 1. FC Magdeburg lifted the European Cup Winner's Cup — a feat no other east German side has replicated. Now, after a long journey in the lower leagues, the club sits in the second division.
"I think it was impossible to see back then what would happen to football in the east, especially right after Reunification. There were just so many unknown factors. I think people may have been a bit naive," Carsten Müller, who played at Magdeburg prior to and following the fall of the Berlin Wall, and now runs their academy, told DW.
Magdeburg's transformation from continental kings to a second-tier side reflects the fate of many of their east German counterparts. Of the 56 professional teams in Germany's top three leagues, only six hail from the former GDR. The seventh eastern club, RB Leipzig, were founded after Reunification. Decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the geographical divisions of men's and women's football remain.

A rude awakening
"When the industries surrounding a club break away, and the economic situation in the city and region only get more difficult, you're suddenly hit with a wave of challenges. Players and clubs are constantly put to new tests," said Müller.
The all-encompassing privatizing shock that overtook east German industry after the Berlin Wall collapsed impacted football as well. Formerly state-run clubs in the East suddenly had to compete with cash-flush western sides on the open market.
"Lots of players from the East were quickly brought into the Bundesliga by western clubs," former Dynamo Dresden player and current academy boss Marco Hartmann told DW. "That meant Dynamo's best players were also quickly poached back then, and also at a fairly low price, which meant it didn't really benefit the club much."
Eight-time East German champions Dynamo Dresden, now playing in the third division, became just another part of the eastern clearance sale for rich Bundesliga sides. Things only deteriorated from there.
"There was extreme financial mismanagement at many clubs in the East. I think it was down to all the new possibilities that hadn't previously been available due to state financing," Hartmann said.
Relegations and bankruptcies, often going hand in hand, became commonplace. The region's only two Bundesliga sides, Union Berlin and RB Leipzig, are both outliers. Union, in the top flight since 2019, benefit from the broader infrastructure and increased financial opportunities at their disposal as a capital-city side. Leipzig's controversial, commercialized foreign ownership and lack of Cold War history makes their path to regular Bundesliga contenders hardly comparable.


Different path, similar destination
While eastern men's clubs were doing their best to stay afloat, a women's side from the former GDR rose to the top of the game. Turbine Potsdam won six Bundesliga and two Champions League titles between 2004 and 2012, in part because women's football was a significantly more level playing field.
"I think in women's football, you didn't have to invest as much compared to a men's team," former player Anja Mittag told DW.

Mittag believes the club flourished because of the influence of coach Bernd Schröder, who helmed the side from its founding in 1971 until 2016. Success helped the club establish vital support and infrastructure.
"We still needed good sponsorship and attendance to earn money. That was big, we had a city that was really backing us in Potsdam," Mittag said. 
"And if you're successful, you attract players. I think winning the Champions League was a huge advantage," he added. "Plus, it's not as though there were a lot of other top teams to choose from back then. Especially compared to men's football." 
Turbine have since struggled to keep up with various men's clubs that have recently invested heavily in women's football, the vast majority of which are in the west. Mittag's former club underwent a decade of slow decline that finally saw them relegated in 2023.
The most successful eastern women's team is now RB Leipzig, where Mittag is a coach. The former Germany international joined the club as a player in the third division and accompanied Leipzig through 2023's Bundesliga promotion in the dugout.
"I think it's important for the region to create different opportunities. I think it really creates a lot of possibilities for young players, and makes things more attractive," she said.
Focused on the future
According to Mittag, Leipzig are focusing on their youth system in order to shore up their squad and reach their mid-term goal of Champions League qualification. And while European qualification is a pipe dream for most former GDR men's teams, success at the academy level might be the only way to become more competitive in an increasingly imbalanced environment.
"It's about developing first-team players that identify with the club and are passionate about playing for Dynamo Dresden. It's really important for our members and fans that we have players from the region, and ideally fans themselves, in the team," said Hartmann.

"I don't see being considered a developmental club as a bad thing," said Müller. "We've got to find ways to develop players for our first team. [Magdeburg] has a lot of potential and has invested heavily in the future."
While the financial gap between established western Bundesliga sides and most eastern clubs remains insurmountable, investment in youth football is beginning to pay off. According to German public broadcaster ZDF, 22% of the 880 players to represent Germany at youth level in the last decade are from the east. Given only 18% of Germany's population hails from eastern states, the overrepresentation in youth football is a sign things are moving in the right direction.
Whatever the future holds, eastern clubs — and their fans — will take it in stride.
"Football in the east has always shown that we rarely devolve into whining. Instead, we've always shown that, regardless of how difficult things get, we keep our chins up. And that's what people are proud of," said Müller.

Organisers say 3,800 volunteers participated in Thursday's event

Published
2 October 2025




The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Hindu nationalist organisation whose work played a large role in propelling Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power, has celebrated its centenary with an event attended by thousands of members.
In a speech at RSS headquarters in the western city of Nagpur, its chief Mohan Bhagwat addressed a range of topics, including the conflict with Pakistan earlier this year, climate change, economic inequality and political turmoil in India's neighbouring countries.
"The world functions through dependence on each other. That is how relations between any two nations are maintained. No country can survive in isolation," he said, echoing Modi's emphasis on self-reliance in the context of Donald Trump's hefty tariffs on India.
The all-male RSS, the most powerful of India's Hindu nationalist groups, has often been accused of practising a divisive ideology, which it denies.
Founded in 1925 by an Indian physician, Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, the RSS, seen as the  ideological fountainhead of the country's ruling political party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has become the most influential organisation in the country.
While it says it is not a political organisation, the RSS plays a seminal role in Indian politics due to its ideology and connection to the BJP. Many RSS volunteers are supporters of the BJP. 
Modi, who joined the RSS as a pracharak (campaigner) when he was a young man, also praised the organisation at an event in Delhi on Wednesday, and released a special commemorative stamp and coin to mark the occasion - sparking criticism from opposition parties.

In Nagpur on Thursday, organisers say 3,800 volunteers participated in the event. 
The men - the RSS does not accept female members, though it has a parallel organisation for women - stood in a military-like formation on the field of an outdoor stadium, wearing their instantly recognisable uniform of khaki trousers, white shirts with sleeves rolled up to the elbows and black triangular caps on their heads. Under the blazing sun, they performed a synchronised exercise routine that RSS volunteers perform at the beginning of their daily meetings.
What began as a group of just more than a dozen men has grown to become the largest volunteer organisation in the world, according to Bhagwat. But when asked how many people are members of the RSS, spokesperson Sunil Ambekar says they do not keep track.
"It's not a government set-up. Please understand, if you see us in a very fixed frame, then you don't understand the RSS. The RSS is a volunteer organisation, working on the ground."
The opacity around who is a member of the RSS and how many people belong to it is by design, experts say.
"It's an extremely complex organisational network," says Tanika Sarkar, a visiting professor at Ashoka University in Haryana state. "It is a sprawling network which is difficult to characterise and difficult also to identify clearly, because you never know where the RSS ends and the other far-right organisations begin."
The reference is to the Sangh Parivar, or family of Hindu nationalist groups, which are led by the RSS.
It is not easy to pinpoint exactly what makes the RSS. It operates several charitable programmes such as schools, health clinics and its members are often on the scene to help during natural disasters, organising volunteers and distributing aid.
"It can be called a political organisation, it can be called an NGO, it can be called a welfarist organisation, all of which would be true and none of which would be entirely accurate," says Ashok Malik, a partner with business consultancy firm The Asia Group and a former adviser to the government.

But its Hindu nationalist principles make it a controversial organisation, says Prof Sarkar. 
"Primarily because of its very visceral Islamophobia, which it has been teaching for a century. Its claim is that only Hindus are the rightful owners of the country and citizenship is actually the rightful property of Hindus," which she says ends up "othering" large parts of the country.
In his speech on Thursday, Bhagwat - as he has often done - tried to distance himself from division and violence by invoking India's long history of diversity.
"Despite all our distinct identities, we are all parts of a larger society. As a society, a country, a culture and a nation, we are united," he said.
But the ideology promoted by the RSS has been linked to some of the darkest moments in post-independence India.
On 6 December 1992, members of the RSS were part of a Hindu mob which destroyed the 16th Century Babri Mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya, claiming it had been built on the site of a temple destroyed by Muslim rulers. 
It sparked religious riots across the country, killing more than 2,000 people. (After the mosque's demolition, the RSS was banned for a third time in post-independent India, for about a year - the first time was after independence leader Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated by a man believed to be a former RSS member).
Last year, Modi fulfilled a decades-old Hindu nationalist pledge to build a temple in Ayodhya where the mosque had once stood.
Lately the RSS has been making an effort to increase its public outreach. Last month, it held a three-day conclave in Delhi and invited members of the media. Although the centenary events were open to the foreign press, it was still tightly controlled, with journalists not allowed to speak to attendees or volunteers.
Nevertheless Mr Malik believes this outreach is part of the RSS's efforts to be better understood. "The toxicity in our political and public rhetoric is a long-term challenge for the country and for society. It [the RSS] is trying to inject a correction and a maturing."
But for minority communities, this softer image doesn't signal any change to the core belief of the organisation, that India, as defined by the RSS, is for Hindus first.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[A consortium led by Saudi Arabia and a key figure in Donald Trump's circle have brokered a big money deal for video game publisher Electronic Arts. It looks to be something bigger than pure business.

Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) are on the verge of taking another major step in their acquisition of sport, but this time in the virtual world. The PIF, an arm of the Saudi royal family, has joined forces with US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and US investment firm Silver Lake to buy video game company Electronic Arts (EA) for $55 billion (€47 billion), subject to final approval.
This will make it the largest private equity-funded buyout in history and a significant amount of the purchase price is made up of borrowed money. The PIF had previously owned about 10% of EA. EA makes a host of successful games, with sports titles like EA FC (previously FIFA) and Madden NFL, key to its commercial success. 
The size of this deal dwarfs other PIF investment in sports, such as LIV Golf or the purchase of Premier League team Newcastle United. As with those ventures, and similar cultural asset purchases, economic diversification is a key aim for the Saudis and their Vision 2030 project, led by Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman.

Why is Saudi Arabia investing billions in sports?

The Gulf state currently relies on oil and gas for approximately half of government revenue, depending on energy prices. As the world attempts slowly to move away from fossil fuels, the motivation to diversify the economy is clear, as is the push towards sports and entertainment, which also offers a sheen to the country's global reputation.
Saudi has eSports strategy and domestic concerns
"PIF is uniquely positioned in the global gaming and eSports sectors, building and supporting ecosystems that connect fans, developers, and IP creators," said Turqi Alnowaiser, deputy governor and head of international ínvestments at PIF.
Simon Chadwick, professor of Eurasian sport industry at Emlyon Business School in France, said Saudi Arabia is indeed one of "few countries in the world that has a national eSports strategy" but said there is another motivation.
"There's something domestic and social there too. Saudi Arabia has a population in which 70% is under 35 years old. And this is a population born and brought up on console games and Super Mario. In fact, Mohammed bin Salman has talked himself of being a Super Mario fan when he was a kid," he told DW.
"It's catering to the domestic population. And that is particularly significant because it addresses some security concerns. Mohammed bin Salman himself has talked about the decades that Saudi Arabia has lost to radicalization.
"So I think the provision of not just games and competitions and sports, but also the employment opportunities that they bring is one way of addressing radicalization. To an extent linked to that is the fear of Arab uprisings like those we've seen in Morocco. This is something that the royal family in Saudi Arabia absolutely does not want. It doesn't want its position challenged. So it is a little like bread and circuses. It's about giving people what they want."

The protests in Morocco mostly involve young people and are concerned with the poor state of public services. One of the primary frustrations from protesters is that the North African nation is building stadiums in preparation for co-hosting the 2030 football men's World Cup with Spain and Portugal, while neglecting public health and education crises.


Big events lend legitimacy but do they hide truth?
The next men's World Cup after that will be in Saudi Arabia in 2034 while the eSports World Cup was in the country earlier this year and they will host the first eSports Olympics in conjunction with the International Olympic Committee, in 2027.
"If you can demonstrate to the world that you are staging events that are trouble-free, very appealing and popular across the world, drawing large numbers of people, suddenly you have a legitimacy in the world and that gives you a voice that historically you may not have had before," added Chadwick.

Claims of sportswashing, using sporting events to "whitewash the country's abysmal human rights record" in the words of Human Rights Watch, have been constant and brushed off by bin Salman and others in the regime.
However, Joey Shea thinks the latest purchase fits the pattern of distraction. In that buying a game or a football shirt or ticket to a golf event don't appear to the untrained eye to be political purchases.
"These investments are being used to deflect attention from a human rights crisis," Shea, a researcher for HRW on Saudi Arabia, told DW.
"Our concerns about human rights are with the Saudi government and how they are wielding their investments as a tool of soft power and influence abroad.
"I have the utmost faith that your average fan does not want to, by default, support a brutal, abusive government abroad just by virtue of being a fan of a particular sport," she added.
"The tragedy in the sportswashing campaigns is that the average fans' love for the game is leveraged in service of these abusive aims."
Kushner and Trump strengthen Saudi links
Bin Salman said in 2023 that "if sportwashing is going to increase my GDP by way of 1%, then I will continue doing sportwashing." 
And Chadwick pointed out that "Saudi Arabia is trying to buy influence, but it's just playing the game that everybody else is playing as well."

The presence of Kushner's Affinity Partners as one of the parties in the consortium is another aspect of the buyout with significant political undertones. Kushner, who has previously served as a senior adviser to Trump, developed close relations with bin Salman when in office and has cultivated them since.
His father-in-law, meanwhile, makes money from the Saudis through their LIV Golf venture, with the breakaway tour playing on his courses even when the established PGA Tour pulled away following the January 6 siege of the Capitol by Trump supporters in 2021.
The Trump Organization, which encompasses the president's business interests, this week also signed a deal to build a $1 billion development known as Trump Plaza in the Saudi city of Jeddah, further cementing the ties between Saudi Arabia and the US administration.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Meta and Google are introducing political ad bans on their social media platforms in the EU. How will political parties across Europe — particularly Viktor Orban and his ruling Fidesz party in Hungary — respond?
    Several social media companies, including Google and Meta (Facebook), are stopping the running of political ads on their platforms in the EU Image: Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto/picture alliance   
The first round of the Polish presidential election was held on May 18.
In what was a very heated campaign, political parties and a number of newly established proxy organizations (e.g. Facebook pages run by fake political NGOs) in Poland together spent roughly €360,000 ($422,000) on Facebook advertising in the 30 days prior to the poll.
In Hungary, the ruling Fidesz party spent a similar amount of money on political ads during the same period, even though a general election there was, at the time, almost a year away.


Considering that the Hungarian media outlets under direct governmental control are delivering the same political message as Fidesz, this means that, technically speaking, the Hungarian government spent more than all Polish political parties put together — even though Poland's population is four times bigger than that of Hungary. 
Key to Fidesz's political communication strategy
Paid social media content is a key element in Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's domestic political communication strategy. His Fidesz party pours enormous amounts of money into it — amounts that stand out even at the EU level.
Based on the analyses of the Hungarian think-tank Political Capital, Fidesz spent four times more than all opposition parties combined in the run-up to last year's European Parliament election.
It is worth noting that campaigning in this election was not just restricted to Hungary but was, in fact, going on simultaneously in 27 countries across the bloc.


During this period, five of the top eight most promoted campaign videos on YouTube across the EU were paid for by Hungary's Fidesz. Indeed, the top three in this ranking were all created, posted and paid for by Fidesz, making it a record spender on social media in the EU.

Huge social media budget
A more recent example also demonstrates that Orban is playing in a different league to other prime ministers in the region when it comes to the size of his social media budget.
As Czechia entered the final days of its general election campaign, spending on Facebook advertising peaked there, too. Nevertheless, it is dwarfed by the sums of money spent in Hungary.
Facebook's political ad ban came into effect on October 1.
While all political parties in Czechia together spent less than €500,000 on Facebook advertising between August 23 and September 21, Fidesz and its satellites (proxies, directly controlled and aligned media) spent nearly €2.5 million during the same period.


In short, Fidesz and aligned organizations easily overspent political ad spending in entire countries — multiple times over.
'A permanent governmental campaign'
"Citizens of Hungary live in a permanent governmental campaign. These numbers simply confirm that," Robert Laszlo, an election expert at Political Capital, told DW.
"In this calendar year, 87% of political ad spending can be linked to the government (Fidesz as a party, its politicians, media under its full control, etc.) and only the rest to the opposition parties, independent media and NGOs," he added.
Given that several social media platforms are introducing political ad bans, Lazlo said that Fidesz is losing "a very important pillar of its communication strategy."
He also pointed out that the auto-detection algorithm of Google would appear to be imperfect because YouTube videos financed by Fidesz are still visible and are labelled as "Jobs and Education" or even "Arts and entertainment" even though Google's political ad ban came into effect on September 22.


Fidesz was well prepared
But Fidesz was prepared for the introduction of the ad ban.
Earlier this year, Prime Minister Orban announced the launch of what he calls his "fight club" (Harcosok Klubja) initiative, an online recruiting process for activists that Orban calls "digital freedom fighters."

The intention is that these activists will fight the "foreign-backed opposition" online by arguing in the Facebook comments section, sharing and forwarding content, etc.
Peter Magyar ahead in the polls
Orban is right in assuming that his Fidesz party is lagging behind its challenger, Peter Magyar, whose Facebook page has an outstanding organic reach and continues to grow.
While Magyar has not spent a cent on political ads since he set foot in politics in February 2024, his Facebook page has the highest organic reach every month, according to Zsolt Hanula, the social media expert at Telex, a Hungarian news website.
But Magyar is everywhere, not just virtually, but physically, too. After the EU elections in June 2024, he managed to integrate virtually the entire opposition into his party (Tisza), by attracting anti-Orban voters who previously voted for other opposition parties.
His party has also been topping the polls since late last year, according to independent pollsters such as Median.
A key element in Magyar's success is his strong, almost constant physical presence in rural areas.
Magyar often visits Fidesz strongholds, highlighting local grievances, shaking hands and talking to people. These campaign trail events are a great way of mobilizing voters across the country.

Orban organized a huge campaign event in Budapest on September 20 with a view to converting his core supporters into "digital fighters."
In short, it seems that while Orban's strategy is mainly virtual and digital, there are challenges from the offline environment as well. 
Will Orban's new strategy work?
So, does Orban seek to answer the ban on political ads on social media with online activism by Fidesz supporters? 
Clare O'Donoghue Velikic, a social media expert who spent nine years at Facebook's Politics and Government marketing team, is quite skeptical.
"Building up an online network of fake grassroots organizations is the typical playbook of political actors like Orban. It's called astroturfing," she told DW. "At the end of each such Facebook profile, there might be a real person pushing buttons, but fake accounts can also be automated by social media bots to amplify electoral messages."
O'Donoghue Velikic said that she assumes Fidesz will most likely use both approaches: "In fact, this entire online digital warfare from Fidesz can easily be a cover story. They can point to their activist gatherings to demonstrate the humans behind the screens, while an unprecedented amount of new fake accounts can be deployed in an automated way."
O'Donoghue Velikic is also doubtful that the social media platforms' political ad bans will be effective, because even if the system works perfectly, there are — as illustrated by Fidesz — still plenty of ways of getting around them.

据央视新闻报道，当地时间2025年9月20日凌晨，乌克兰无人系统部队精准打击俄罗斯两处炼油厂及石油基础设施，直指俄军后勤命脉。

同一天，乌总统泽连斯基在社交媒体发文称，俄军以40枚导弹及约580架无人机形成密集火力网，对乌克兰进行彻夜轰炸，造成乌方3人死亡、数十人受伤。
始于2022年的俄乌冲突，俨然已成为现代战争技术演进的试验场。无人机集群凭借自主识别能力和集群作战能力撕开防线，巡航导弹精准穿透防护网直击战略目标，电子战系统持续干扰敌方通信链路。
“俄乌冲突中，双方均展现出极强的适应能力。这正是颠覆性技术（Dirruptive technologies）发挥作用之处：借助海量数据分析能力与廉价精确武器（如无人机）的批量生产能力，俄乌双方均能快速调整战术。”俄罗斯科学院普里马科夫世界经济与国际关系研究所研究员德米特里·斯捷潘诺维奇在接受南方周末记者专访时表示。
斯捷潘诺维奇是俄罗斯外交与国防政策委员会成员，专注于战略武器、远程精确武器、颠覆性技术研究。在他看来，随着人工智能、量子计算、定向能武器等新兴技术迅猛发展，越来越多国家甚至非国家行为体都能获得颠覆性技术，“这正在颠覆全球军事的整体格局”。
“军队必须引入适应能力，这比任何具体技术都重要。”斯捷潘诺维奇谈及新兴技术对现代战争的影响时强调，“三个月前有效的战术，现在可能就已失效。”
颠覆性技术改变全球军事格局
南方周末：你研究的重点领域是颠覆性技术。在你看来，颠覆性技术主要有哪些特征？
斯捷潘诺维奇：目前并没有关于“颠覆性技术”的统一定义，但它们确实具备一些共性。最重要的一点是，“颠覆性技术”能够改变战争的进行方式——不仅包括实际作战层面，也包括人们对战争的认知。“颠覆性”更多是发生在人的认知层面，而非战场上。
其核心在于，当某项新技术问世，它可能令现有的武器过时，或极大增强其他国家武器的能力。这就是其界定性特征。但我想再次强调，颠覆通常并非发生在战场，而是发生在决策者、军事规划者等人的思维中。
南方周末：你所说“发生在决策者思维中”，具体指什么？
斯捷潘诺维奇：总体而言，大国之间会尽

 台湾泡泡茶品牌贡茶的母公司贡茶国际（Gong Cha Global）出面澄清，它已决定不再与本地现有特许经营商续签协议，但会在2026年与新的特许经营商合作，在新加坡重新登场。
贡茶国际总裁雷纳许（Paul Reynish）星期四（10月2日）在一份声明中说：“新加坡对我们来说是一个非常重要的市场。我们对2026年重新开业感到非常兴奋。”
贡茶国际也说，在韩国和日本市场推出的基础上，贡茶将在本地市场推出更新后的2.0版本，并制定计划成为市场领先者。
“（新版本的门店）顾客等候时间显著缩短，回头客增多，整体顾客满意度也大幅提升。明年，我们将把这一理念引入新加坡，并重新启动我们雄心勃勃的计划，与新的特许经营商一起在市场上扩大规模。”

这已是贡茶第二次结束与本地经营商的特许合作关系。
本地商人郑惠元在2009年将贡茶引进新加坡。不过，他的特许经营合约在2016年底到期，当时他认为新合约的条款苛刻因此决定不续约，并把贡茶店改为自家品牌哩喝（LiHo）。
创办豆先生（Mr Bean）的本地商人江培生之后取得特许经营权，于2017年12月把贡茶带回本地市场。
贡茶于2006年在台湾高雄开设首间分号。公司随后扩张业务至韩国、美国、加拿大和澳大利亚等地。
2019年，美国私募股权基金TA Associates为贡茶增资，随后收购了先前拥有贡茶70%股份的韩国公司。同年，英国公司GC Group BIDCO收购了剩余的30%股份，并将贡茶总部迁至英国。
目前，贡茶以直营和特许经营的方式，在全球超过28个市场拥有超过2000家门店。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will mark this German Unity Day in Saarbrücken. Sometimes French, sometimes German, sometimes autonomous — Saarland's history is one of change. 
    The festivities marking the 35th anniversary of German reunification are being held in Saarbrücken, the capital of Saarland Image: Pressebild der Evangelischen Kirche Saarbrücken   
It was a football game for the history books: On March 28, 1954, 53,000 spectators at Ludwigspark stadium in Saarbrücken watched Saarland battle West Germany to qualify for the Football World Cup, to be held in Switzerland.
Saarland, today firmly established as one of Germany's 16 federal states, then had its own national football team. More than that: the population of about one million lived in their own country, with its own constitution, flag and currency, situated between Germany and France.

How did Saarland come to have this special status?
"It is its location on the border," historian Gabriele Clemens told DW.
Saarland is in southwestern Germany, directly bordering France.
"It was a bone of contention between German territories and France for a long time. Between 1800 and 1950, the people of Saarland changed their nationality 5 times," Clemens said. 
In 1920, following World War I(1914-1918), the region was placed under the administration of the League of Nations; therefore, it was under international control. Victorious power France gained the right to exploit its rich coal deposits. In 1935, the population voted by a large majority to return to what had then become National Socialist Germany under dictator Adolf Hitler.
History repeated itself following World War II (1939-1945): Occupying power France took control. However, this time, it wanted to get a hold on the Saarland population for the long term. From 1947, Saarland was a semi-autonomous state under French influence.

Highly emotional: The 1955 referendum
Some Saarland residents saw that as an opportunity for a new beginning, European unity and lasting peace. But many felt culturally and linguistically German. In 1955, it came to a referendum on the so-called Saar Statute. Should Saarland retain its special status? Or become part of West Germany, which at the time was experiencing its "economic miracle"?


"The arguments in the run-up to the vote were conducted with great emotion and sometimes also with violence," historian Clemens said. "Today, if you speak with an 80-year-old who experienced that time, they can still remember very well the propaganda from both sides. It was highly emotional."
With a majority of about 68%, the Saarland population decided to join the Federal Republic of Germany. On January 1, 1957, Saarland officially became part of Germany. With this, the "Saar question" was resolved and an obstacle on the path of Franco-German friendship was removed.
At the celebration in the state theatre in Saarbrücken, then-German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer said: "The Saarland population, France and Germany have shown how it is possible to resolve conflicts which at first seem unresolvable — on the basis of human rights, free self-determination and in the spirit of peace and reconciliation."

A look to the East
In view of this "small reunification," Adenauer turned his attention to the German Democratic Republic (GDR), also known as East Germany: "I am not giving up hope that resolutions are also possible in the East," he said.
But it took more than 30 years for reunification between West- and East Germany to happen.
The "small reunification" of Saarland and the Federal Republic of Germany often seems to have been forgotten today.
"However, here in the region it is very present, very well remembered," Clemens said. The tumultuous history has shaped the region's sense of identity. "Previously, the Saarland population had also belonged to Prussia and Bavaria. And it was only through this two-fold separation following the First and Second World Wars that Saarland became what it is."
That is: a symbol of European Unity. Many Saarland residents speak fluent French. On weekends, French people come to the state capital Saarbrücken to shop. During the week, about 275,000 people cross international borders on their commute to work in Saarland and the surrounding regions, more than anywhere else in the European Union.

Structural change: Coal and steel under pressure
"Saarland's big problem is the economy," historian Clemens said. Its coal and steel industries have been increasingly under pressure from international competition since the 1960s. Saarland's last mining operation was closed in 2012.
"What is increasingly emerging as an alternative is education, research and technology transfer," Clemens said. "Pharmaceuticals and medical technology are very strong. I think that is where the future lies. However, they do not employ as many people as once worked in the mines."
Today, Saarland has become "a completely normal part of Germany," Clemens said. The soccer match of 1954 remains a reminder that its people could have chosen a completely different path — as their own small country. By the way, the Saarland team held its own against the West German favorites but ultimately lost 1-3 and did not qualify for the World Cup.
The Federal Republic of Germany became the football world champions in Bern three months later.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[星期四（10月2日）重点：

 
美国华尔街股市主要股指期货在星期四小幅走高。在7时截稿时，标准与普尔500指数期货上升11.30点或0.17％，报6722.50点；以科技股为主的纳斯达克100指数期货起93.90点或0.38％，报24894.80点；重量级的道琼斯指数期货则微跌7.40点，报46433.70点。
华尔街主要股指在隔夜（1日）收盘时走高。医疗保健板块涨幅最大。市场投资者已将比预期疲弱的私人就业数据，以及美国联邦政府关门的不确定性抛诸脑后。如果美国政府在星期五（3日）之前仍未重新开门，美国劳工部9月份就业报告预计将被推迟发布。
标准与普尔500指数隔夜上升22.74点，闭市报6711.20点。道琼斯指数起43.21点，闭市报46441.10点。纳斯达克100指数也升高0.49％或120.88点，以24800.86点收市。
美国股市隔夜的交易继续保持活跃，交易所的总成交量是197亿9000万股，比过去20天的186亿2000万股平均成交量多。
盘前交易重点：

 
美国电动车制造商特斯拉（Tesla）即将在较迟时候发布第三季度交货量报告。市场分析师普遍预计，特斯拉的交货量将取得约5%的增长。这主要是因为美国电动车税收抵免在9月底到期，消费者因此抢在截止日期之前买车，刺激了销量。不过分析师认为，这种提振可能只是暂时的。特斯拉股价在今晚盘前上升1.83%，截稿时报467.85美元。
超微（Advanced Micro Devices）的股价在今晚盘前继续上涨3.20%，截稿时报169.26美元。据网络新闻Semafor报道，有知情人士称，英特尔（Intel）正在与超微谈判，以便将超微纳入它的代工客户名单。
量子股价在今晚盘前上涨。截稿时，IONQ、Rigetti、SEALSQ股价上涨约3%；Quantum Computing股价也起了2%；D-Wave Quantum股价则起1%。
星期四下文我们来看看刚在隔夜挂牌交易的Fermi Inc股价飙升的情况。今晚盘前该股继续起13.03%，截稿时报36.77美元。
盘前活跃股按序：Plug Power、英伟达（Nvidia）、特斯拉（Tesla）、英特尔和辉瑞（Pfizer）。截稿时，除了Plug Power股价下跌之外，其他四只活跃股的股价全部上升。

Fermi Inc
（纳斯达克证券交易所代码：FRMI）
能源房地产投资信托公司Fermi Inc刚刚在星期二（9月30日）首次公开募股（IPO），在隔夜首日挂牌交易时股价就猛飙将近55%，闭市报32.53美元。它的强劲走势在今晚盘前仍持续着。截稿时，这支股票还起了约15%。这似乎反映市场投资者对投资蓬勃发展的人工智能领域的渴望。
在10个月前，Fermi还只是未真正成型的概念而已。但是在星期二启动了IPO之后，以首发价每股21美元计算，它已经是总市值达到138亿美元的巨大独角兽。
这家总部位于得克萨斯州阿马里洛的房地产投资信托公司（REIT），是由前美国能源部长佩里（Rick Perry）共同创立的。Fermi的股票除了在纳斯达克股挂牌交易以外，也会于星期四（10月2日）在伦敦证券交易所开始交易。
Fermi是在今年1月成立的。公司计划在得克萨斯州狭长地带，从得克萨斯理工大学租赁的一块土地上建造全球最大的数据中心园区。Fermi说，这片占地5236英亩（约21平方公里）的土地最终将用来建设数据中心仓库，并与天然气发电厂、核反应堆、太阳能发电场和电池系统连接。
Fermi首席执行官诺伊格鲍尔（Toby Neugebauer）说，到了2038年，这个园区的发电量将达到纽约市所有发电厂的两倍。他甚至在接受媒体采访时说：“Fermi不是独角兽，而是多角兽。”
通过在纳斯达克和伦敦证券交易所同时上市，Fermi向纽约和伦敦的投资者出售总值约6亿8250万美元的股票。这笔资金的大部分就是要用来购买基础设施设备。Fermi的公司结构是属房地产投资信托基金，这种公司通常是以支付高额股息而闻名。但是Fermi目前尚未有盈利，因此在未来几年可能都不会支付股息。
目前股市也没有一家单一地点的房地产投资信托基金，而且主要资产还是个尚未建成的发电厂。根据一些分析师的评论，目前最类似Fermi这样的公司的，应该只有Equinix。不过，Equinix本身是拥有数据中心，而不是发电设备，而且它的股息收益率已有2.4%。]]></content>

 长期争议不断的加密货币平台波场（Tron）创始人孙宇晨，星期四（10月2日）在新加坡出席TOKEN2049大会时透露，波场平台上的用户账户数量目前已达到3亿3500万，预计今年年底将增至3亿5000万。
演讲中，孙宇晨也介绍了波场平台今年的几个新变化，包括被美国商务部选为同步发布季度国内生产总值（GDP）的九个区块链平台之一，以及通过借壳登陆纳斯达克等。
他说，波场平台内目前交易份额最大的稳定币，是与美元挂钩的“泰达币”USDT，目前日均交易量已超过220亿美元（约283亿新元），“有时会达到300至400亿美元”。
孙宇晨在演讲中进一步透露，他们计划在今年第四季推出一款所谓人工智能（AI）驱动的新产品，但目前还不能分享更多信息，届时将举办发布会。
星期三（10月1日），孙宇晨还曾在新加坡宣布，波场生态下的首个去中心化永续期货交易所（Decentralized Perpetual Futures Exchange）“SunPerp”已在近期上线，并决定以“孙悟空”为华文品牌名。
孙宇晨在2023年时遭美国证券交易委员会（SEC）提起诉讼，指控他未经注册提供和销售“波场币”（TRX）等加密资产，并涉嫌操纵市场。
但到了今年，美国总统特朗普表态放宽对加密货币的监管力度后，美国证券交易委员会和孙宇晨在2月份向法院提交动议，要求暂停诉讼，以寻找潜在的解决方案。
诉讼危机暂时解除不久，波场今年7月24日便通过借壳方式，以Tron Inc.为主体正式在纳斯达克上市，股票代码为“TRON”。上市后，Tron Inc宣布将波场币（TRX）置入它的资产储备。]]></content>

近期，针对当地人大代表、政协委员“推迟普职分流”的提案，多个地方相继就此作出回应。
据澎湃新闻报道，浙江省舟山市定海区教育局透露，嵊泗县已率先实施综合高中试点，所有初三毕业生均升入嵊泗中学完成高一年级的普通高中课程学习，从高中二年级起根据学生学业表现和自身发展意愿实施普职分类培养，部分学生将进行中职、技职课程的学习，为学生们提供了普通高考与职教高考的双向选择通道。
陕西省渭南市提出，扩大综合高中班试点范围并增加招生数量，2025年在4所中职学校设立综合高中班。指导综合高中班学校做好学籍注册、选课走班、综合素质评价、学生发展指导、学业水平合格性考试等工作，全面提高学生培养质量。
建综合高中，是把“普职分流”变为“普职分类”，既缓减中考分流焦虑，又推进普职融通的积极探索。现阶段，我国各地均可探索把中职学校建设为综合高中，并取消普高和中职学籍划

 纽约隔夜股市创新高、降息预期和科技股的推动，促使亚太股市星期四（10月2日）普遍扬升，不少股市升至多年高位，新加坡、首尔和台湾股市皆创闭市新高。
新加坡海峡时报指数星期四劲涨72.09点或1.67%，收于4395.21点的闭市新高，盘间创下4404.25点历史最高纪录。
首尔股市猛涨2.70%至3549.21点的闭市新高，继续引领亚太市场；台湾股市上涨1.52%至26378.39点的闭市新高；东京股市结束四天连跌，回涨0.87%；上海股市继续休市，香港股市假期后首日交易强劲上弹1.61%；悉尼股市上涨1.14%；东南亚股市普遍走高。
瑞讯银行（Swissquote Bank）高级分析师奥兹卡斯卡娅（Ipek Ozkardeskaya）指出，人力资源与数据公司ADP星期三公布的美国就业数据，给市场注入一剂强劲的鸽派情绪，将让投资者的热情持续多几天。数据显示，美国9月份就业岗位不仅没有增加，反而减少3万2000个。这个消息令股市欢呼雀跃，因为这为美国联邦储备局降息的预期提供坚实支持。
加上人工智能与云服务方面继续传来利好消息，科技股推动星期三美国股市的标普500指数和道琼斯指数创新高，纳斯达克指数也攀至接近新高。
老虎国际新加坡市场策略师黄佳仁接受《联合早报》采访时说：“受亚洲区域股市走强和隔夜美国股市上涨的支持，新加坡海峡时报指数星期四收于历史新高。交易员们越来越认为美国政府停摆只是暂时现象，因此投资者对风险资产的兴趣依然相对强劲。”
资深股票经纪冯施钧受访时也说，海峡时报指数的上涨很可能受到区域市场积极情绪的推动，这得益于美国隔夜收盘上涨。美国投资者似乎乐观地认为，政府停摆将是短暂的，对经济的影响将微乎其微。
新加坡股市星期四整体交易量增至18亿8000万股，交易总额大增至21亿4000万元，其中约38%或8亿零590万元来自交易额最高的四只股票：星展银行、新电信、大华银行和华侨银行。全场上升股398只，下跌股205只。
30只海指成份股当中，多达28只股价上涨，两只持平，没有成份股下跌。DFI零售集团股价上扬4.66%至3.37美元，是涨幅最大的海指成份股。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Many airlines worldwide are struggling to fill their cockpits with experienced pilots as demand for air travel grows. Can signing bonuses and fast-track promotions make up for a massive retirement wave?

Flying is just not what it used to be. Long lines to go through security, cyberattacks on airport check-in systems, labor strikes, lost bags and cancellations. Now on top of all that, there is a global shortage of pilots and airlines are feeling the pinch.
COVID-19 pandemic, pilot training was put on hold in many places as companies waited to see what the pandemic would do to the travel industry. Today, as air travel rebounds, there is a training backlog, and schools are struggling to get new pilots in the air.

At the same time, the pandemic inspired many senior pilots to unexpectedly retire early. More are waiting to hang up their wings, particularly in North America.
This leaves airlines with the double challenge of compensating for a wave of retirements and finding more pilots amid increasing demand for air travel, particularly leisure travel.
How many pilots are needed?
The current growth in air travel has surprised many airlines, said Christoph Klingenberg, an expert in airline and airport management at Worms University of Applied Sciences in Germany.
"Since it takes several years to train pilots, the situation will take a couple of years to normalize," Klingenberg told DW.
How many pilots will be needed varies greatly depending on the source.
The US alone will have about 18,200 job openings for airline and commercial pilots each year for the next decade, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics' Occupational Outlook Handbook. Added together, that comes to over 180,000 new US-based pilot jobs.
Taking both passenger and freight into account, planemaker Boeing recently estimated that a whopping 660,000 new commercial pilots will be needed worldwide by 2044.
Becoming a pilot is a big investment
"Aspiring pilots who begin their training today will be well-positioned to seize emerging opportunities by the time they graduate," according to the Boeing report. To meet this huge demand, aspiring pilots must have access to "relevant, affordable and accessible training."
Although experienced pilots can earn a lot, getting into the cockpit is a long and expensive journey itself.
In the US, flight training can cost over $100,000 (€85,000), a daunting amount likely to discourage many from dreaming of an aviation job.

In addition to other certifications and ratings, the US Federal Aviation Administration requires all first officers at an airline providing scheduled passenger air service to have an Air Trasport Pilot (ATP) certificate. This means an additional 1,500 hours of flight experience, a requirement that can take another one to two years for pilots coming out of school to meet.

Just pay pilots more?
Recently, many major and regional airlines have increased pilot pay to attract more applications and keep the pilots they already have.
"The biggest way to make a commercial airline pilot job more attractive is to increase the pay," said Dan Bubb, a professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, specializing in commercial aviation. "For many years, this was especially noticeable with regional airlines, where the pay was deplorably low."
"Today, pilot salaries are higher than I have seen in a long time," Bubb, who is also a former airline pilot, told DW.
Besides higher base salaries, some airlines are also offering bonuses and other perks to find and retain pilots. Others are designing better work-life-balanced schedules for flight crews. All costs that add to passenger ticket prices.
But not all companies are so generous. Just this week, Lufthansa pilots voted in favor of a strike after negotiations over pension contributions fell apart. So far, no strike date has been announced. It would be the first Lufthansa pilot strike since 2022.


Mandatory retirement at 60, 65 or 67?
Two decades ago, international airline pilots were forced to retire at 60, according to rules put in place by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The group, which is based in Montreal, Canada, and an agency of the United Nations, sets regulations for civil aviation in over 190 countries.
With advances in health the retirement age was raised to 65 in 2006. Pointing to pilot shortages and even higher health standards, now some are proposing raising the retirement age to 67.
"Flight experience, often associated with age, is significantly correlated with flight safety," wrote US Senator Ted Cruz in a September 19 letter to President Donald Trump looking for support in increasing the mandatory pilot retirement age.
"Having an 'arbitrary' retirement age is also making air travel more expensive!" added Cruz. "As you know, in economics, less supply necessarily leads to higher prices."
Whatever the economics behind it are, the idea has run into opposition from pilot unions. And, so far, both the  Civil Aviation Organization and the Federal Aviation Administration have kept the current retirement age in place.

What else are airlines doing to lure pilots?
To keep the supply of new pilots flowing and those already in the air happy, airlines need to increase their hiring efforts, expand training facilities and recruit pilots from other noncommercial airlines, argues Christoph Klingenberg.
He also suspects raising the retirement age to 67 is "a step in the right direction."
Some airlines around the world are hiring pilots with considerably fewer hours under their belts, offering big signing bonuses and waiving certain requirements, said Bubb. Still, they, too, must undergo rigorous training and pass exams before they can take control of a plane's yoke.
More automation in the cockpit?
Could artificial intelligence (AI) or increased automation in the cockpit make up for a lack of pilots?
While many industries are latching onto the idea of using AI to streamline work, airlines are holding back for now in the cockpit, said Klingenberg, and doesn't expect that to change much in the coming decades.
AI will play a significant role but not replace pilots, said Bubb. "I have no doubt that AI will make air travel more efficient, in terms of time and fuel burn, but not replace humans," he said.
As for getting more live pilots in the air, it really depends on how many are needed as the demand for air travel increases. "I expect the situation to improve after 2030, so it might take five years to recover," concluded Klingenberg.
Bubb thinks the shortage situation will "remain moderate" and spots a chance for the industry.  
"It is an opportunity for airlines to plan ahead so that they are proactive instead of being reactive whenever there is a shortage of pilots looming," he added.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The Czech Republic could face instability after the upcoming parliamentary election. Although the right-wing populist party of ex-PM Andrej Babis is well ahead in the polls, it is not expected to get a majority.

Czech President and former Chief of the General Staff of the Czech Armed Forces Petr Pavel is a level-headed man with strong nerves.
Yet even though he almost never gets emotional in his capacity as head of state, he has seemed for quite some time to be deeply concerned about the state of democracy in the Czech Republic.
On Tuesday evening, less than three days before the polls open in Czechia's parliamentary election, he spoke to the nation. His address was broadcast live by numerous Czech media outlets.
"I must strongly reject the words of some politicians that this year's elections are to bring about a change in the system," said the president, adding, "Our democratic system is embedded in the Constitution."
More than usual at stake
Pavel went on to say that the country needs "a government that will protect our sovereignty within the community of democratic nations and will not leave us at the mercy of Russia and its efforts to restore a sphere of influence in Central and Eastern Europe."

The president's address showed that there is more than usual at stake in this year's parliamentary election, which will take place on October 3 and 4.
For the past four years, the country has been ruled by a liberal-conservative coalition led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala. Although not a failure, this government was certainly not very popular, either, as it dealt above all with the major financial fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine.
Change of power in the cards?
Everything points toward a changing of the guard at government level.
The country is expected to shift toward right-wing populism and all that comes with it: euroskepticism, pro-Russian and anti-Ukrainian positions, and agitation against refugees, the LGBTQ+ community and green policies.
The undisputed frontrunner going into the election is the ANO party of right-wing populist ex-premier and billionaire Andrej Babis. ANO is both an acronym for "Action of Dissatisfied Citizens" and the Czech word for "yes."
While ANO is currently polling at between 28% and 30%, the ruling liberal-conservative alliance Spolu (Together), which is made up of three center-right parties, is predicted to get between 20% and 22% of the vote.
The liberal-conservative Mayors and Independents (STAN) party, which is also part of the ruling coalition, is polling at between 10% and 12%.

Other parties that are expected to enter parliament include the green-liberal Czech Pirate Party (7%–9%), which was part of the coalition until last year, and three extremist opposition parties: the far-right Freedom and Direct Democracy party (SPD, 13%–14%), the pro-Russian communist alliance Stacilo! (Enough!, 5%) and the euroskeptic right-wing nationalist Motorists for Themselves party (5%).


Widespread dissatisfaction
Together with Poland, the Czech Republic has the most successful economy in Central Europe.
Since the collapse of communism in 1989, it has not had significant periods of nationalist populist government like those in Poland, Slovakia or Hungary — not even during the four years when Andrej Babis and his ANO party were previously in government (2017–2021), when Babis was less populist in outlook than he is now.
Since then, however, shifting geopolitical tectonic plates — especially in the form of Russia's all-out war in Ukraine and the toxic influence of the Kremlin — are having a major impact on Czechia, too.
As a result of Russia's war in Ukraine, the Czech Republic was hit by an energy price shock in 2022 and 2023, and inflation of up to 15%. Despite support from the state, this hit many people — particularly pensioners — very hard.
The economic situation began to settle down in late 2024, with inflation dropping considerably, the economy growing moderately, and real wages rising. Nevertheless, dissatisfaction with Fiala's government is high and widespread.
Pro-Russian, anti-Ukrainian narratives
The pro-Russian and anti-Ukrainian propaganda of opposition politicians, including ANO leader Andrej Babis, has also contributed to this mood.

The Czech Republic is one of Ukraine's staunchest supporters, and Petr Fiala was one of the first foreign heads of government to travel to Kyiv in March 2022.
In terms of the size of its population (approx. 10.9 million), Czechia took in a record number of Ukrainian refugees (approx. 660,000). It is estimated that 400,000 still live in the country.
Andrej Babis and other right-wing populists and extremists have turned this into a narrative that the Fiala government cares more about Ukraine and Ukrainians than about Czechs.
Babis has accused Fiala of "dreaming of a war with Russia." He has called for a halt to military support for Ukraine, restrictions on aid for refugees, and "reasonable" relations with Russia.

'A government of national betrayal'
In view of all this, the government parties have turned Czech foreign policy and relations with Russia into the decisive issues in this campaign.
Prime Minister Fiala recently said that if Andrej Babis is elected, Czechia would get a "government of national betrayal."
Some observers see the threat as real: "One of Putin's dreams could soon be realized," wrote Petr Honzejk of the Czech national daily newspaper Hospodarske noviny. "Should ANO come to power — whether on its own or in cooperation with the SPD, Stacilo! or the Motorists — our country will stop its defense against Russian disinformation and hybrid attacks."
Other observers accuse the premier of focusing too much on "scaremongering," or not enough on domestic and economic issues.

Writing in the same newspaper, columnist Jan Kubita suggested that government politicians should have studied the works of the most recent Nobel Prize winners. "Then perhaps they would understand that the prerequisite for the long-term growth and prosperity of a state lies in the improvement of its institutions."
And indeed, many Czechs are very unhappy about the state of public infrastructure, sluggish state institutions, bureaucracy, and excessively slow digitalization.
The president is not Czechia's 'savior'
For years, Andrej Babis has been promising to change all this and to make the state more efficient. When he was last in office, however, he did virtually none of this.
This time around, he is also promising lower taxes, energy prices and real estate prices, as well as higher pensions and more support for the needy. He has not, however, revealed how he intends to pay for all of this without increasing the national debt.
President Pavel, who plays an important role in the formation of a government, hinted a few weeks ago that he might not under certain circumstances nominate Babis for the post of prime minister.
During his address to the nation on Tuesday evening, however, he cautioned that he should not be seen as "Czechia's savior."
"The president is not, and cannot be, the last resort who will overturn the result of the election for one side, or save it for the other," he said.
Addressing voters directly, he said clearly and calmly: "You will decide."

Cheryl Grimmer was three when she disappeared from Fairy Meadow beach in January 1970

Reporting fromWollongong, New South Wales




Published
2 October 2025




A volunteer team using cadaver detection dogs to search for the body of a British child who disappeared in Australia more than 50 years ago has found an "area of interest".
The group hopes their finding is a breakthrough in Cheryl Grimmer's case and have reported the location to New South Wales Police, who are now on the scene.
Authorities suspect the three-year-old, who had emigrated from Bristol with her family, was abducted from Fairy Meadow beach in Wollongong in January 1970. 
"A search will be conducted tomorrow with the assistance of specialist officers as part of ongoing inquiries," police told the BBC in a statement.


Today, bathed in the sun, the beach looks as idyllic as it must have been all those years ago. From the sand dunes, looking inland, the terrain gradually climbs into dense bushland.
A short drive up into the hills, there's a small pocket of woodland on the edge of an upmarket suburb that could reveal a terrible secret.
Balgownie was the location mentioned in a confession made by a teenage boy - also from England - a year after the toddler vanished. Decades later, a judge disallowed that admission.
In 2019, a trial of the suspect, known only by a codename, Mercury, who'd been charged with Cheryl Grimmer's abduction and murder, collapsed. The man, in his 60s, had denied any wrongdoing.

Fairy Meadow

In 1970, three-year-old Cheryl Grimmer was taken from an Australian beach. No-one knows what happened. Fifty years on - can the mystery be solved?




Listen on Sounds


Cheryl's brother Ricki Nash was seven when his little sister vanished. He last saw her in the changing rooms at Fairy Meadow.
"This should have been done 55 years ago," he said as the specialist team with dogs trained to detect human remains began its work. "My question is, why wasn't it?  
"Yes, it's extraordinary. The police have never canvassed this area in detail even though they had a confession. Not just a confession, a very detailed one."
He has spent a lifetime craving answers, but does not want to find them here among the tall trees, creek and bushes.

"We always live with the hope that someone took her that couldn't have a child, raised her well. One day she'd grow up, find out she didn't belong to that family.  We've had people over the years do that to me and to our family: knock on the door and say that they are Cheryl and your heart rate goes at a million-to-one," Mr Nash told the BBC.
"We were hoping for it to be Cheryl one day. So, to be here looking for a body or part thereof, I mean, it's not a good thing." 
Nine-year-old Rufus is the principal search dog. His handler, Chris D'Arcy, the president of Search Dogs Sydney, a charity, had offered to help the Grimmer family after attending a missing persons seminar in Wollongong. He had also heard the BBC's Fairy Meadow podcast, presented by Jon Kay, which has been downloaded five million times.
The canine team has had success in previous cold cases dating back more than half a century. Last year, they found human remains in a lake in northern New South Wales.
Now, Mr D'Arcy's team believes it has made a potential breakthrough in the Grimmer case.
"What we believe we have located is an area of interest and will pass the information on to the authorities," he said. "The dog showed a distinct change in behaviour."
Ricki Nash said the news made him "tremble".
"If it is Cheryl out there – she has been there for 55 years now – she shouldn't have been," he said.

Balgownie was mostly farmland in 1970.  Frank Sanvitale, a former detective who worked on the Grimmer case, has come to support members of Cheryl's family.  They have become close and share deep frustrations about the broader police investigation over the decades.
"To find something after 55 years, I'm hoping we do, but the chances are one in a million," he explained. "It would be like winning four lotteries in a row. You've got to use a bit of common sense and be sensible and logical about it."
The retired investigator has challenged the individual or group responsible for the toddler's disappearance to come forward.
"What about doing something for Cheryl, that little girl you took away and owning up to what you did and [giving] families here in Australia and in England... some peace," he said.

"My family has been through so much and it is a continuous fight," says Ricki Nash's daughter Melanie


Tragedy sends ripples of grief through families. Ricki Nash's daughter, Melanie Grimmer, has four children. She is also anxiously waiting for news of the search at a command post on the side of the road.
"I know my dad hopes that nothing is found. I hope she's found, I hope the baby girl comes home. My family has been through so much and it is a continuous fight," she told the BBC. "I feel sick in my stomach being here."
Much has changed since 1970. But one thing remains steadfast - the determination of a grieving family to uncover the truth.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[One resident's trash is another's treasure has long been part of Berlin's culture, but the German capital has had enough and plans to raise fines. Will they work?
    Up for grabs. Berliners are inventive when it comes to passing on clothes, books and furniture they no longer want Image: Josh Axelrot/DW   
Between old sofas and broken fridges, boxes of baby clothes and crates of cassettes, hidden treasures dot Berlin's streets. In one such collection of unwanted stuff, Berlin musician Eno Thiemann discovered a new favorite author.
The Haruki Murakami books were left outside with the label "zu verschenken." Meaning "to gift", it's a tradition that has long seen Berliners leave their repurposable goods on window ledges and in front of houses for others to take. And take, they do. Often within a matter of minutes.
"I was very pleased when I came back in 2013 to see that there's some kind of culture," said Thiemann, who had left Berlin three decades earlier before the practice took off. "Most people don't just throw the trash out — it's a nice thing to do and it's enriching the neighborhood."
But as Berlin plans to fine people for putting items on the street, this informal circular economy could become a thing of the past. The city's environment department argues that while the idea behind leaving things out for others to take is "good and desirable," it has "led to excesses that are not in line with the original intention." And cleaning up is not cheap — last year it cost the city about €10.3 million ($12.8 million) to remove rubbish, including e-waste and construction trash dumped without authorization.

"It must be made clear that leaving items on the street does not release the owner from responsibility for them, along the lines of 'I gave it away' so now I'm rid of it," a spokeswoman for the department told DW.
Berlin raises its fines
Last year, Berliner Stadtreinigungsbetriebe (BSR), the city's garbage and recycling contractor, said it cleaned up 54,000 cubic meters of illegal waste found across Berlin, an 8% increase over the year before. The authorities see the main culprits as construction waste disposal firms looking to save money.
Items that are not claimed are ultimately cleared away by the cityImage: Josh Axelrot/DW
Heavy fines are necessary because "incorrigible litterers can often only be reached through their wallets," a BSR spokesman said, adding that the problem is worse in some districts than in others.
A spokesperson for the district said residents dumping appliances like refrigerators and washing machines could be hit with a penalty of between €1,000 and €15,000. The rate previously maxed out at €5,000.
How realistic are the penalties?
The idea is that the fines will either be issued by plainclothes field staff or will result from witnesses who go online to report dumping. But Berliners are not convinced the new penalties can be enforced.
"They go out and they find a mattress and then what?" asks Marianne Kuhlmann, co-founder of Circularity, a Berlin-based organization that helps businesses reduce their waste. "The likelihood that they will catch the person in the moment he puts the mattress there is super low."
"As for finding people, it will be hard unless people are leaving their business cards inside the boxes," Thiemann said.


A more formal circular economy
The BSR argues that residents can use other avenues to dump what they no longer want.
"No-one in our city is forced to simply leave their trash on the street," BSR spokesman Sebastian Harnisch told DW. "There are a wealth of attractive disposal options available to private individuals for getting rid of bulky waste, electronic waste, and other trash free of charge or at low cost."

These, they say, include neighborhood swap days, one of the city's 14 recycling centers and a secondhand store, named "NochMall", which plays on the German noch mal, meaning once more. For that option, they offer a pick-up service for a fee.
A 'short-sighted' policy
Sustainability advocates, however, say that is not the point. They argue that formal drop-off points are less attractive for those who can't drive or don't have a car.
Doris Knickmeyer, a Zero Waste City Mentor at Berlin nonprofit Zero Waste Verein fears the city's crackdown could have ill-intended results.
"People who are afraid of being fined in the future, they might throw good, usable things in the bins now because it's easier and more convenient than driving through half the city to donate them at NochMall." 
She also highlights the lack of differentiation between those dumping ratty furniture that is unlikely to be reclaimed, and those putting out a box of lightly used clothes that might be snapped up before the end of the day.
Not everything that people chuck out finds a new homeImage: Josh Axelrot/DW
"Naming those who take environmental responsibility in the same sentence with polluters who avoid responsibility is highly problematic," Knickmeyer said.
How well is Berlin doing on waste recycling?
In 2021, Berlin unveiled its Zero Waste 2030 strategy, pledging that "raw materials should be continuously reused and recycled to create new products for as long as possible."
By the end of the decade, the city aims to recycle 64% of construction waste and reduce residual trash volume by 20%.
Making the pledge and establishing a zero-waste agency within the BSR put Berlin on the right path, but a 2024 report from the intergovernmental Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says the city's "reliance on waste incineration remains high, and recycling rates lag behind national averages."
Cities like Madrid, Brussels, Copenhagen and Ljubljana have all begun either reducing their reliance on incineration or rejecting plans to build new plants to reduce carbon emissions from burning trash.
Knickmeyer proposes Berlin maintain its "zu verschenken" culture with dedicated spots on each street or in each neighborhood for giveaways.
"You have to find a balance between making it easy and fostering a sharing culture in the community, but also understanding that this causes real trouble for the city because it's a million-dollar-cost each year to get the streets cleaned," Kuhlmann said.

近日，一则新闻引发关注。据极目新闻报道，齐齐哈尔市宋女士上小学的孩子郭某某2024年12月在课间踢足球时，不慎被张同学踢出的足球伤到右眼，导致视力严重下降、视网膜震荡。当地教育局表示，课间活动属意外事件，并非学校组织或体育课统一活动，校方不承担相关责任，建议双方家长自行协商处理。
此事的舆论焦点在于，学校是否需要为郭同学的受伤负责，以及如何看待这类校园意外事件。教育局的答复函表示，“活动为同学自发进行，并非学校组织”“未涉及危险器械或违反校规的激烈对抗”“事发场地并无地面湿滑或设施破损的安全隐患”，依据《中华人民共和国民法典》及《学生伤害事故处理办法》相关规定，校方在教育、管理与保护方面不存在过错，依法不承担侵权责任。这一决定实际上传递了一个概念：学校对学生该负责的一定要负责，但并不应该承担“无限责任”。

China is launching a new visa category for young foreign technology talent, a move that comes just as the Trump administration sharply increases the cost for U.S. companies to hire high-skilled overseas workers.
China will add a K-visa to its ordinary visa categories, a foreign ministry spokesperson announced Monday. The policy, already written into the revised Regulations on Administration of the Entry and Exit of Foreigners on Aug. 7, is designed to attract young science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) professionals.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Germany's army was only recently equipped with armed combat drones. And the country has plenty of work to do when it comes to defending against enemy drones in German skies.  
    Shoulder-mounted jammers are one way to bring drones down from the sky Image: Sven Eckelkamp/IMAGO   
"We're really behind when it comes to defending against drones," Defense Minister Boris Pistorius recently admitted. Uncertainty is high after Russian drones invaded the airspace of several NATO countries in recent weeks. Suspected Russian drones have even been supposedly spotted over Germany. On the German television channel ZDF, Pistorius assured viewers that everything was being done "to make up for this shortcoming."
Why is Germany so poorly equipped to defend itself against drones? One of the reasons for is has to do with the equipment needed to defend against drones. Shooting down incoming drones with fighter jets, as Poland recently did, is possible but also expensive and dangerous over populated areas.
More suitable for this tast is Rheinmetall's Skyranger anti-aircraft tank, which can be deployed quickly and can also combat swarms of drones. The Bundeswehr, Germany's Armed Forces, has ordered 19 of these, which will not be delivered until 2027. However, military experts estimate that the demand is significantly higher.
Its predecessor, the Gepard anti-aircraft tank, was decommissioned by the Bundeswehr years ago and later given to the Ukrainian armed forces. It has proved extremely effective in repelling Russian drone attacks.

In addition to jammers, drones are also an effective means of defense against drones. The Bundeswehr has recently acquired German-made interceptor drones that capture enemy drones with nets.
"We need to develop a multi-layered defense system that provides various options for shooting down or disabling drones — electronic countermeasures, kinetic devices, and then low-tech solutions such as net launchers," drone expert Ulrike Franke from the European Council on Foreign Relations told DW.
Closer cooperation between German army and police needed
Another challenge that Germany faces in defending against drones has to do with the distribution of responsibilities. At the moment, responsibility for countering drone threats is divided between the Bundeswehr and the police forces of Germany's 16 federal states.
Defending against external attacks, such as those from fighter jets or large drones, falls within the remit of the military. The Bundeswehr is also authorized to take action if drones appear over military sites.
In all other cases, drone defense is the responsibility of the police, who are responsible for internal security. If a drone is spying on a German airport or industrial facility, for example, the Bundeswehr cannot be called in.
Although the police do have means of defending against drones, the challenge they face is getting them to the location where the drone has been spotted quickly enough. Security experts think that setting up a comprehensive "drone defense shield" over Germany is unrealistic.

First combat drones to be purchased 
The separation of military and police duties has developed over time and is enshrined in the constitution. Given the current threats, the Bundeswehr will now be granted more powers to defend against drones. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt plans to allow the military to assist the police, for example, by shooting down drones. The Air Security Act is to be amended accordingly. Dobrindt is also proposing the creation of a new drone defense center to coordinate the work of the federal and state governments.
The Bundeswehr is not only stepping up its efforts in drone defense but also arming itself with drones. Recently, Inspector General Carsten Breuer, the highest-ranking German soldier, announced that they would conduct their first live-fire exercises with armed drones at the end of the year.
In March, Germany decided to procure so-called kamikaze drones for the troops. These are aircraft equipped with warheads that explode upon hitting their target. This is something quite new for Germany.


Learning from Ukraine
It is no longer possible to wage war without drones — this became quickly apparent in Ukraine shortly after the Russian invasion in February 2022. Hundreds of thousands of drones are being deployed there. On the front lines, small kamikaze drones loaded with explosives are destroying expensive military equipment. The widespread use of reconnaissance drones means that no enemy movement goes unnoticed. This "transparent battlefield" has radically changed the nature of warfare.
Drone expert Ulrike Franke recommends following Ukraine's example: "It is absolutely clear that NATO countries need to look to Ukraine and learn from Ukraine when it comes to the ability to deploy, manufacture and modify drones quickly," she told DW.

The Bundeswehr must now keep pace with these developments. Due to political concerns, it has long refrained from procuring attack drones. Critics feared that unmanned, remotely controlled aircraft could lower the threshold for the use of military force. There has also been much suspicion about the autonomous functions that many drones have.
It was not until the war in Ukraine that this changed. In 2022, the German government decided to arm Bundeswehr drones for the first time. It ordered guided missiles for five Heron TP drones, aircraft-sized drones manufactured in Israel. Until then, the Bundeswehr had used only unarmed reconnaissance drones.
It took until the beginning of this year for the decision to purchase kamikaze drones. According to the Ministry of Defense, this marked "the beginning of a new era for the German Armed Forces." The small disposable drones are known as "loitering munitions." This refers to the drone circling above the target before diving down and exploding.
The categorization of kamikaze drones as "ammunition" has very practical reasons: ammunition is fired and, therefore, consumed. A larger drone, on the other hand, is considered an unmanned aerial vehicle. With regard to flight safety and personnel certification, aircraft are subject to significantly higher technical requirements, thereby circumventing them.

Rapid innovation and arms procurement
The German Armed Forces have already begun conducting training exercises on the deployment and defense against drones. This is now considered an "everyman-skill" that every soldier must master. A specific number of drones are being procured for this purpose and for immediate needs.
What's more, the Bundeswehr is keen to avoid having to keep thousands of drones in storage. Technology in this field is advancing so rapidly that the usual approach to arms procurement — long lead times, long periods of use — would be counterproductive. So new contractual agreements are being made with manufacturers to ensure they can quickly deliver large quantities of the latest standard models when needed.
German AI start-ups are the first choice now. Among them is Helsing, a Munich-based company founded in 2021, which has already produced several thousand combat drones for Ukraine.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[6元一份的鸡排，让顾客感受到了“600元服务体验”。
   
在“鸡排哥火”遍全网的同时，千年瓷都景德镇也迎来了泼天流量。
近日，“鸡排哥”李俊永在社交平台迅速走红，被网友亲切称为“景德镇鸡排主理人”。 6元一份的鸡排，让顾客感受到了“60元情绪价值和600元服务体验”。
截至9月30日，#鸡排哥文学#播放量达1.5 亿，#景德镇烟火气#进入抖音热榜TOP3，带动“景德镇陶瓷” 搜索量激增 400%。
全国各地不少游客去景德镇打卡。数据显示，今年9月25日～29日景德镇北站发送旅客62402人，相比2024年同期增长19%。根据媒体报道，有游客坦言，此次景德镇之行，是专程为打卡“鸡排哥”而来。
国庆假期，各大平台中，景德镇文旅订单数据十分亮眼。去哪儿数据显示，10月1日，景德镇酒店入住量较去年同期增长了30%，增幅高于去年。
美团旅行数据显示，国庆假期期间，景德镇文旅预订量同比上涨10%，其中20～30岁年轻人占比达60%，北京、武汉、上海、杭州、深圳等地游客假期爱来景德镇打卡。近一周，“景德镇陶瓷博物馆”搜索量同比去年增长超284%，“景德镇陶瓷”关键词评论讨论量同比增长超127%。
在“鸡排哥”爆红全网的同时，景德镇也在努力接住泼天流量。景德镇文旅特聘他为“文旅推介官”，景德镇城管、环卫等相关部门成立工作专班。
9月30日，江西景德镇市政公用集团，在“鸡排哥”火出圈的路段——珠山大道（五中路口路段）约500米路面进行铺设，该路段于9月30日中午13:00铺设完毕，半天时间火速焕新“鸡排大道”。
根据“景德镇发布”，如今的景德镇，“鸡排哥”的摊位前排起长队，陶阳里景区游客云集，在千年窑址前驻足拍照，陶博城、三宝、古窑、高岭、瑶里、瓷宫、雕塑瓷厂等景区内人头攒动，景德镇中国陶瓷博物馆内“无语佛”依旧沉思……他们共同见证着当下这座千年瓷都的每一次蜕变。
与景德镇相似，近年来，一些小城因拥有美食、美景、丰富的历史、民俗文化、建筑等旅游资源和文旅产品，吸引力不断上升。将当地丰富的文化特色展现出来，需要合适的载体。无论是一顿烧烤、还是6元的鸡排，还是一场球赛，都是这样的载体、着力点。
广东省体改研究会执行会长彭澎分析，随着旅游业发展的深入，旅游观念和兴趣也发生了变化。很多年轻人追求更为小众、更具特色的旅游体验。
现在的游客尤其是年轻人已经不局限于景点和地标打卡，也渴望融入当地人的日常生活场景，体验当地的烟火气和人情味。
“新闻联播”微信公众号一篇文章称，“鸡排哥”的走红，或许也带来一个启示：一地文旅的吸引力，不仅在于恢宏的建筑、特色的景区，也在于其展现出的独特生活气息。珍视自发生长的“毛细血管”，让烟火气孕育出更多流量爆点。
“人心是最大的市场 ，真诚是最好的品牌”，景德镇“鸡排哥”的走红，正是对这句话的生动诠释。]]></content>

        <id>https://www.yicai.com/news/102852119.html</id>
        <link href="https://www.yicai.com/news/102852119.html"/>
        <updated>2025-10-02T07:07:12.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[凭借特斯拉股票大涨，马斯克的净资产一度触及5000亿美元。
   
特斯拉创始人兼首席执行官马斯克成为全球首位个人财富突破5000亿美元大关的亿万富翁，进一步巩固了其全球首富的地位。
根据《福布斯》实时亿万富翁榜单显示的数据，美东时间10月1日下午3:30，马斯克的净资产一度触及5000亿美元。尽管收盘时回落至4990亿美元左右，他仍以约1500亿美元的优势领先于排名第二的甲骨文首席执行官埃里森（Larry Ellison）。
这一财富的跃升与特斯拉股价的强劲表现密不可分。在周三的交易中，特斯拉股价上涨3.31%，收于每股459美元，为马斯克的净资产增加了超过60亿美元。
值得注意的是，自马斯克于今年4月在财报电话会议上宣布将卸任美国政府效率部（DOGE）负责人一职，并将更多精力投入特斯拉以来，公司股价已累计上涨近一倍。当前，特斯拉的市值已回升至接近去年12月所创下的历史高位。

5000亿美元身家都包括什么
尽管上个月埃里森因甲骨文云基础设施业务与人工智能（AI）合作前景的推动，其财富一度增长超过40%，并短暂超越马斯克成为全球首富，但这一局面并未持续太久。过去一个月中，特斯拉股价大幅攀升近40%。
除了持有的特斯拉股票价值外，马斯克2018年所获的与业绩挂钩的首席执行官薪酬方案中，亦包含大量特斯拉股票期权。据报道，若该奖项未于2024年1月被特拉华州法院法官裁定取消，这部分期权的当前价值将高达1330亿美元（在计算其净资产时，已将这些期权价值按50%折减）。
在马斯克财富版图中，他旗下其他企业的估值也显著增长。例如，航天企业SpaceX目前估值已达4000亿美元，较去年12月的3500亿美元进一步上升。马斯克持有SpaceX约42%的股份，据此估算其价值约为1680亿美元。
今年3月，他还将人工智能初创公司xAI与2022年收购并已更名为X的社交媒体平台推特（Twitter）进行合并，成立xAI控股公司，整体估值达1130亿美元。马斯克在该实体中持股约53%，对应价值约600亿美元。
此外，特斯拉于9月向美国证券监管机构提交了初步委托代理声明，提出一项“2025年首席执行官业绩奖”计划，提请股东批准新一轮与业绩挂钩的激励方案。根据该提案，马斯克需完成多项业绩指标，包括将特斯拉市值提升八倍，实现100万台人工智能机器人的销售，交付1200万辆特斯拉汽车，并完成其他多项运营目标，就能解锁完整的价值1万亿美元的薪酬权益。
特斯拉董事会主席丹霍姆（Robyn Denholm）9月表示，马斯克在经历了几个月在白宫的工作后，已经回到公司“最前线”。几天后，马斯克宣布他以约10亿美元购买了特斯拉股票，这被投资者视为对公司的未来投下信心票。
马斯克迅速增长的财富
回顾马斯克的财富增长轨迹，2020年3月，马斯克的净资产只有246亿美元，而飙升的特斯拉股价让他在2020年8月成为第五位身家突破1000亿美元的富豪。
2021年1月，马斯克以近1900亿美元的身家首次登顶全球首富。同年，9月，他成为继亚马逊首席执行官贝佐斯（Jeff Bezos）和法国奢侈品巨头路威酩轩（LVMH）总裁阿尔诺（Bernard Arnault）之后，历史上第三位财富超过2000亿美元的亿万富翁。
此后，他的财富继续快速增长，于2021年11月突破3000亿美元，并在2024年12月突破4000亿美元，成为首位跨过4000亿美元门槛的个人。
据报道，如果马斯克能维持当前的财富增长速度，他有潜力在2033年3月之前成为全球首位万亿富翁，这也恰好是其1万亿美元特斯拉薪酬计划中首批期权可行使的日期。
但马斯克本人对此强调，这一激励方案的核心并非金钱。“这不关乎‘薪酬’，而是关于我对特斯拉拥有足够的控制力，以确保如果我们建造数百万个机器人时能保证安全”，马斯克在9月写道，“如果我将来只是被那些甚至不拥有特斯拉股份的激进股东顾问公司踢出去，我对这样的未来感到不安。”]]></content>

Rescuers will start using heavy equipment to move concrete slabs

There are "no signs of life" under the wreckage of a collapsed Indonesian school where 59 people are still missing, rescuers have said.
Hundreds of students, most of them teenage boys, were inside the two-storey Islamic boarding school in the town of Sidoarjo when it collapsed on Monday. At least five students were killed and about 100 injured, officials said. 
Thirteen people have been freed from the debris since rescue efforts began, though two later died in hospital. Rescue operations had been challenging due to the unstable structure of the building. 
On Thursday, the disaster mitigation agency (BNBP) said rescuers using thermal drones failed to detect signs of life from the rubble.


"Last night, we even [cleared] the area to ensure silence. [We] hoped that with the use of sophisticated equipment... we might hear some signs of life," Lt Gen Suharyanto, the head of the BNBP said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
"Scientifically, no signs of life were found." 
He added that the team had decided to move on to the "next phase" of operations - using heavy equipment to move slabs of concrete. These debris blocks will either be lifted using cranes or cut into smaller pieces.
Rescuers had not been able to do this earlier as there were fears it could lead the building to collapse further, risking the lives of any possible survivors. 
Authorities had on Wednesday said crying and shouting could still be heard from under the rubble.

Anxious relatives had camped out at the school for days as they wait for news of their loved ones


Anxious families are waiting at the school, many of them tearful but holding out hope that their loved ones are still alive.
"I am hoping for the best news, that my brother survives," said Maulana Bayu Rizky Pratama, whose 17-year-old brother is missing, told AFP news agency.
"I hope my brother will be found soon. I feel sad thinking of him being down there for four days."
Ahmad Ikhsan, 52, told Reuters: "I believe my son is still alive."
The BNBP said on Wednesday that 59 people were still trapped in the rubble, though this figure has fluctuated greatly over the past few days, with Suharyanto earlier saying that data would always be "conflicting" in the "early stages" of a disaster. 
The building was under construction when it collapsed, with two extra floors being added. The BNBP later said that the building's unstable foundation meant it could not support this weight. 
Sidoarjo town's regent says the school's management had not obtained permits to add more floors to the building.

 美国人工智能公司OpenAI完成一项员工股份转让交易，公司估值达5000亿美元（约6439亿新元），超越全球首富马斯克（Elon Musk）的太空探索技术公司SpaceX，成为全球估值最高的初创企业。
据知情人士透露，OpenAI的现任和前员工出售约66亿美元股票，买方包括Thrive Capital、日本软银集团（SoftBank Group）、Dragoneer Investment Group、阿布扎比的MGX，以及普徕仕（T. Rowe Price）在内的投资者。这使得公司估值大幅跃升，远超今年稍早由软银牵头融资时的3000亿美元水平。
这波迅猛增长凸显市场对人工智能的投资热潮。由奥尔特曼（Sam Altman）领导的OpenAI，与英伟达（Nvidia）等企业一道，正推动数据中心建设与人工智能服务的全球竞赛。尽管尚未实现盈利，OpenAI已通过与甲骨文（Oracle）和韩国海力士（SK Hynix）等企业签署大额合作协议，在人工智能基础设施扩张中扮演关键角色。
此次交易令OpenAI估值超越SpaceX的4000亿美元。OpenAI成立于2015年，最初是以非营利机构形式推动人工智能发展，正在与微软（Microsoft）洽谈转型为传统营利公司。
奥尔特曼与马斯克曾共同创办OpenAI，但后来因发展方向分歧而交恶。马斯克已提起诉讼，指控OpenAI在接受微软自2019年以来的数十亿美元资金后背离最初宗旨。]]></content>

Shah Rukh Khan is one of Bollywood's biggest stars


ByCherylann Mollan

Published

Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan has joined the billionaire club for the first time, becoming one of the world's richest actors, according to a new list.
The 59-year-old's net worth is estimated at a staggering $1.4bn (£1.03bn), according to the Hurun India Rich List 2025, an annual ranking of India's wealthiest individuals. 
This puts him in the league of global celebrities like Arnold Schwarzenegger, pop star Rihanna, golfer Tiger Woods, and singer Taylor Swift, whose net worth is pegged at $1.6bn by Forbes, external magazine. 
Other Bollywood personalities on the list include actress Juhi Chawla, actors Hrithik Roshan and Amitabh Bachchan and film director Karan Johar. 


Often called Bollywood's king of romance, Khan has spent more than three decades in the Hindi film industry and reinvented himself from being an actor to running a major production house and owning a cricket team. 
"Khan's billionaire status is driven mainly by his stakes in Red Chillies Entertainment  [his production company] and Knight Rider Sports [his IPL cricket club]," Anas Rahman Junaid, founder and chief researcher at Hurun India, told the BBC. 
His other sources of income include film earnings, advertisements as well as reported investments in real estate across the world. 


How Bollywood's romance king became an action star

Why the actor's charm has endured the test of time


Khan's entry in the billionaire list is a reflection of the changing nature of India's economic growth drivers, according to Mr Junaid. 
"As the Indian economy matures and moves to its next stage of wealth creation, we are seeing new centres of value emerge beyond traditional sectors like manufacturing, IT and banking," Mr Junaid said. 
Sports, entertainment and IP-driven businesses are now "serious engines of wealth creation in India", he added. 
According to Mr Junaid, this is similar to the evolution that took place in the US, where rich lists that were once dominated by industrialists and bankers now feature sports-team owners, media moguls and celebrity-led brands - from Michael Jordan and LeBron James to Oprah Winfrey and Beyoncé.
But according to Forbes, while many celebrities are incredibly wealthy, "it's rare for their net worths to stretch all the way to ten figures", with less than two dozen, external people on the planet having accomplished that feat.
While four other Bollywood celebrities and their families made it to Hurun's list this year, Khan's wealth is estimated to be significantly higher. 
Juhi Chawla - Khan's co-star in several films - and her family feature at number two, with a net worth of $880m.
The list also includes Hrithik Roshan, who ranks third with a net worth of $260m, followed by director Karan Johar at around $200m and actor Amitabh Bachchan and his family at around $183m. 
In 2024, Johar made headlines when he sold a 50% stake in his production company Dharma Productions,to billionaire Adar Poonawalla - India's top vaccine maker - for $119m. 
India's overall billionaire count has crossed 350 people this year, with billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani retaining the top two spots according to Hurun India.

南方周末研究员 廖浩伦 南方周末实习生 陈雪梅
责任编辑：丰雨
在微信支付和支付宝两大支付巨头攻城略地之下，在众多互联网及科技巨头携场景生态抢滩非银支付的潮涌中，独立非银支付机构（指缺失互联网和科技巨头背景和场景优势的非银支付机构，下同）困境有加剧之势：老牌独立非银支付机构股权一再流拍，头部独立非银支付机构则遭遇大股东或创始股东和高管减持乃至清仓，盈利增长乏力甚至负增长。

2025年10月9日，银联商务极少数股权将在阿里资产官网拍卖转让。这已是该部分股权今年之内第六次被摆上拍卖架，此前五次拍卖均以流拍告终。更令业界唏嘘的是，该股权年初起拍价高达1200万元，10月起拍价已降至718万元，跌幅40%。
银联商务股权一再降价拍卖并非孤例。成立已16年之久的圣亚云鼎支付有限公司（下称“圣亚云鼎”）在2025年也遭遇类似情形。
曾经的头部独立非银支付机构拉卡拉支付股份有限公司（下称“拉卡拉”）和新国都（嘉联支付母公司）则分别遭遇创始股东和高管陆续减持，甚至清仓。
独立非银支付机构为何不再被看好？南方周末新金融研究中心研究员对在A股上市的6家独立非银支付机构近3年中报数据进行深度分析，并调研三位业内资深人士。分析和调研结果显示，在“套码”“套现”等灰色产业被严厉打击的强监管环境中，独立非银支付机构面临利润率低和合规压力大的局面，跨境支付亦卷入红海模式。
在监管机构对非银支付机构实施分化监管策略的监管下（详见《生死之线落定，预付卡机构包揽千万元级罚单》），独立非银支付机构如何转型破局？一位头部独立非银支付机构资深人士接受调研时称，从消费端向产业端转移，尚有发展和布局空间。与此同时，以支付为核心，向前后链延续，形成支付+差异化模式。一些机构已在行动中，且已有一定成效。
一再流拍 股东清仓
股权一再流拍的银联商务并非寂寂无名的公司。全球著名的市场监测和数据分析公司尼尔森发布的收单机构排名显示，2024年，银联商务连续11年蝉联亚太收单机构榜首。它成立于2002年，是首批获得支付业务许可证的支付机构，主要从事银行卡收单业务，是国内最大的收单机构。
查证发现，2025年1月，银联商务约0.12%极少数股权被公开拍卖，起拍价为1200万元。此后五次流拍，起拍价亦不断下调，直至调低至6折起拍价。
圣亚云鼎则于2013年获得互联网支付业务资格，业务包括快捷支付和委托代收付等。目前，其支付许可证续展申请被中国人民银行中止审查。该公司股东拍卖持有的20%股权，从6月27日第一次拍卖被中止，到9月18日第二次流拍。不足三个月，起拍价直接打了7折。
 
为何“资历老”且从事不同领域的独立非银支付机构股权无人竞拍？
“行星谈互金”公众号主理人是某独立非银支付机构资深从业人员，他在接受调研时分析称，支付机构的估值主要由企业净资产、牌照价值、业务价值、品牌和无形资产价值等多种因素决定。近年，受内外部经济环境及行业影响，牌照价值及盈利能力下降，支付机构估值随之下滑。当然，银联商务和圣亚云鼎无人竞拍也有一定自身原因，一是两者拍卖的股权比例低。对收购方而言，收购少数股权意义不大；二是圣亚云鼎自身实力较弱，缺乏业务规模和客户规模基础，品牌、产品及科技等软实力也不足，且企业存在司法瑕疵。更重要的是，它的许可证续期申请被人行中止审查；三是2024年7月实施的《非银行支付机构监督管理条例实施细则》对支付牌照收购方的盈利来源和可持发展能力有较高的门槛要求，大部分中小企业无法企及。
流拍事件一再发生之际，大股东、创始股东和高管的减持乃至清仓独立非银支付机构亦引发关注。
A股上市公司拉卡拉支付股份有限公司（下称“拉卡拉”）和新国都（嘉联支付母公司）分别遭遇大股东、创始股东和高管陆续减持，甚至清仓。2025年9月2日，拉卡拉创始人之一孙浩然完成清仓式减持，套现近5亿元。此前的7月至8月间，拉卡拉股东联想控股和新国都的董事、高管均已分别减持其持有的拉卡拉股份和新国都股份。
 
孙浩然和联想控股分别减持拉卡拉股份，在独立非银支付行业传递了一个较强的信号。支付行业咨询分析机构博通分析金融行业资深分析师王蓬博在接受调研时称，一方面可能是股东认为拉卡拉未来发展空间受限。从近几年财报显示的盈利情况和盈利构成分布看，似乎已达天花板。除了规模日益萎缩的支付板块，金融科技和其他服务的盈利占比越来越低；另一方面，可能和最近稳定币相关概念炒作有关。拉卡拉股价上涨，股东及时套现获取收益。
9月24日，针对上述减持事件，南方周末新金融研究中心研究员致电拉卡拉董秘办公室并发送调研邮件。拉卡拉回复称：“有关信息，请参见公司公告。”
费率战加剧  盈利不景
无论是一再流拍，还是股东减持乃至清仓，独立非银支付机构的困境愈发显现。
南方周末新金融研究中心通过比对官方市场数据和机构中报数据发现，全市场交易额下滑，叠加费率竞争加剧，独立非银支付机构行业性盈利能力下降。
中国人民银行发布的《支付体系运行总体情况》显示，2025年上半年，非银行支付机构处理网络支付业务金额166.28万亿元，同比微跌0.02%。
上半年，在A股上市的6家独立非银支付机构（本文的A股上市独立非银支付机构是指本公司在A股上市或母公司在A股上市的非银支付机构）中，4家在中报中披露了支付交易额。这4家公司支付交易总额为4.28亿元，同比减少2.82%。其中，拉卡拉降幅最大，达8.84%。
 
与此同时，4家独立非银支付机构的支付收入费率向13BP（1BP=0.01%）靠齐。其中，国通星驿费率最高，为13.45BP。除国通星驿实现支付收入费率同比较高增长（同比增幅达11.2%）外，其他3家非银支付机构的费率均同比下跌，跌幅均值达10%。
 
2025年中报还显示，国通星驿支付业务收入同比增长9%，但其他5家A股独立非银支付机构支付业务收入均呈同比下跌状态。
 
携场景之势，互联网和科技巨头抢滩
与独立非银支付机构拉卡拉们的处境迥异的是，互联网和科技巨头纷纷抢滩支付领域。
除支付宝和微信支付已奠定市场地位的头部玩家外，一批手握多元场景入口的互联网与科技巨头陆续通过收购牌照入场，并以“生态+支付”组合拳攻城略地，其布局逻辑与独立非银支付机构形成分野。
南方周末新金融研究中心研究员梳理发现，收购是互联网巨头快速获取支付牌照的主流途径，收购行动持续十多年，至今未止。
2012年，京东收购网银在线，依托电商生态，将支付深度嵌入商品选购和订单结算全流程；2016年，美团收购钱袋宝获得支付牌照，将支付功能无缝衔接外卖下单、到店核销和酒店预订等高频服务，形成“服务消费-支付结算-数据沉淀”的商业闭环，美团支付已成为平台默认首选；2017年12月，滴滴出行通过全资子公司上海时园科技有限公司收购高鸿股份旗下孙公司北京一九付支付科技有限公司，并于2020年将后者更名为北京滴滴支付技术有限公司。
2020年开始，互联网巨头入场的攻势更为迅猛。2020年8月，字节跳动收购合众易宝，将支付与直播带货、短视频种草及本地生活团购深度绑定，2021年初，正式上线的抖音支付借助内容场景实现交易即时转化；字节跳动创始人张一鸣持股99%的石贝科技全资子公司天津同融拟收购海联金汇，但尚未完成。海联金汇旗下子公司联动优势有储值账户运营和收单及基金销售支付等资质。
2020年9月，携程受让东方汇融100%股权获批，并将其更名为上海程付通支付有限公司，与携程高频多元的场景相融合。
互联网平台收购非银支付机构的行动还在延续。2025年9月，同程集团关联公司艺龙网信息技术（北京）有限公司以3亿元收购新生支付有限公司100%股权，并于当月24日完成工商变更，但尚待中国人民银行批准。新生支付原属海航集团旗下公司，于2011年获得支付业务许可，最初开展业务类型为互联网支付及预付卡发行与受理，后因合并浙江盛炬支付技术有限公司支付业务而增加多省银行卡收单。
科技巨头们亦看中非银支付牌照。2016年，小米将捷付睿通收入囊中，依托硬件生态延伸金融服务触角；2021年3月，华为收购讯联智付获牌，随后将其更名为花瓣支付，依托鸿蒙系统与手机、汽车和智能穿戴等硬件生态，打造的全场景支付体验。
相较于拉卡拉等独立非银支付机构，互联网巨头和科技大公司的核心竞争力源于其渗透用户多维度生活场景的护城河。互联网和科技巨头场景赋能下的支付扩张，正不断重塑支付行业的竞争边界。
 
傍巨头，拥抱AI
拓展困境中，不少独立非银支付机构选择收缩版图和业务范围，聚焦与主业相关的领域。
以上市机构中营收第一的拉卡拉为例。2025年1月至9月，拉卡拉通过退股和转股（详见下图）退出商业银行、融资担保和商业保理等有金融属性或类金融属性的相关公司。
 
与此同时，拉卡拉通过战略投资和间接控股的方式（详见下图）将天津市天财商龙科技发展有限公司（下称“天财商龙”）和北京考拉信用评估有限公司（下称“考拉信评”）纳入麾下。至此，拉卡拉的版图已包括传统支付领域、餐饮领域、零售领域和信用评级领域。支付+成为拉卡拉对支付生态的建设。
 
事实上，拉卡拉上市前，考拉信评（原“北京中北联信用评估有限公司”）曾是拉卡拉的子公司。为符合上市要求，拉卡拉将其持有的90%考拉信评股权转让给西藏考拉科技发展有限公司。2021年至2024年，拉卡拉开启了长达三年对考拉信评的收购计划，并于2024年10月以终止交易公告落下帷幕。2025年，拉卡拉通过间接控股的方式成功将考拉信评纳入麾下（详见下图）。

在长达四年的“商业版图扩张计划”里，市场一直对拉卡拉既做支付行业“运动员”，又收购评级机构做支付行业“裁判员”的行为存在争议。2022年，中北联曾因“公司存在人员和办公场所未与股东拉卡拉集团完全独立等问题”被中国证监会北京监管局采取责令改正行政监管措施。王蓬博认为，支付机构与评级公司的利益关联需严格隔离。否则，可能出现商户评级倾斜等道德风险。 
涌入新赛道是另一种破局之道，如“碰一碰支付”“刷脸支付”“刷掌支付”和“看见即支付”等支付形式。新大陆2025年中报显示，新大陆与支付宝“碰一下”等业务合作进一步加深。截至2025年6月末，联合生态伙伴已铺设终端超100万台。
新型支付方式是否会对独立非银支付行业进行一次“洗牌”？“行星谈互金”称，刷脸、刷掌、刷眼等新支付方式和新支付产品，本质是以身体作为支付媒介的延伸。虽然表现形式不断变化，但内在逻辑未变。新支付方式或产品是支付巨头（支付宝和微信）之间的游戏，基本由其引领和主导，中小支付机构作为支付巨头的服务商角色参与，助力支付巨头开展推广和运营。这种现象的背后原因是支付巨头拥有较强的科研实力和资金投入，能够支撑新技术、新产品研发和推广的资源投入。中小支付机构大部分在生存边缘徘徊，诗和远方遥不可及。新支付方式和新支付产品对支付巨头而言，是巩固和挤占市场份额的一次“洗牌”。
独立非银支付机构可在哪些领域助力巨头，并能“分得一杯羹”？
王蓬博称，在实际交易链路中，支付宝通常与持牌收单机构和POS机具厂商合作，由持牌收单机构和POS机具厂商完成机具生产布设、商户拓展、资金清算等收单服务，各方在支付产业链中各司其职、分工明确。支付宝的角色主要聚焦于优化用户端的支付交互体验与服务入口，通过技术创新提升支付的便捷性与场景融合度。
哪种新型支付方式更受大众欢迎？从当前用户习惯的角度观察，相较于“刷脸、刷掌、刷眼”而言，“碰一碰”更受用户欢迎。王蓬博称，支付宝“碰一下”321天就实现注册用户破亿。
南方周末新金融研究中心研究员发现，上市机构在中报中，均提及近期对AI大模型的投入。拉卡拉与新大陆近3年中报研发费用均保持同比增长。
 
从消费端向产业端求空间
较之低费率的境内支付市场，跨境支付曾因高费率而成为颇具吸引力的利润增长点（详见《告别灰色商业模式，“支付第一股”拉卡拉前路何在？》）。6家A股上市独立非银支付机构均在中报中提及其在跨境支付领域的建设。
但曾经的跨境支付蓝海，正被集体出海的非银支付机构“卷”向低费率红海。
以跨境支付领域的龙头企业连连支付为例。2025年上半年，该公司支付交易额高达2.1万亿元，同比增长32%。但其支付收入费率为3.26BP，同比下降5.51%。
行星谈互金评析称，跨境支付已从蓝海变为红海，境外支付机构和境内出海支付机构已“卷”多年，0费率也并不罕见。但跨境支付相对境内支付拥有一定独特优势：一是收费模式更多元化，货币兑换、VCC发卡（即支付机构通过数字化方式发行虚拟信用卡）等成为重要增长引擎；二是境外支付费率仍普遍高于境内，费率差优势仍然存在；三是境内出海支付机构数量相对较少，具备全球化牌照能力的更是少数，境外本地收单市场仍大有可为。跨境支付机构未来的竞争对手未必是同业机构，很可能是以稳定币为代表的加密货币机构。如何在传统支付基础上加载密货币支付功能，同时满足监管合规要求，是跨境支付机构未来的核心挑战，也是重要机遇。
王蓬博亦认为，2024年以后再出海的难度较大。一方面尚需时间进行合规，比如牌照等方面的积累。另一方面需要开发新的市场，难度更大。一些后来者布局海外的体量和利润都相对很小。
无论境内外，独立非银支付机构的自立拓展空间尽无？前述头部独立非银支付机构的资深人士认为，从消费端领域向产业端探求生存与发展空间，无论是线上线上，尚有很多机会。与此同时，以支付为核心，将前后端衔接起来，亦需要独立非银支付机构提供一站式服务，如支付+营销、支付+账务管理等。
他举例称，通联支付融合支付、账户和科技等，深入产业链，为商户、企业和金融机构等提供全方位的数字化服务、增值服务，助力客户实现资金流动数智化；针对各地提升“以旧换新”业务流程效率的迫切需求，银联商务自主研发“银企直连资金拨付软件”“支付即开票软件”获得国家计算机软件著作权登记证书。2024年8月以来，银联商务已深度参与到全国31个省（自治区、直辖市）“以旧换新”活动服务中，支付+AI落地“以旧换新”“国补”活动的解决方案，破解了全国范围内促消费活动业务流程中的效率瓶颈。
博通分析最新报告亦称，在基础支付业务趋稳且同质化的当下，开拓企业数字化服务已成为支付机构破局发展的重要方向。账户侧、收单侧和产业线机构在拓展企业数字化业务时，正呈现出差异化的路径选择。
尽管不少独立非银支付机构在东冲西突中求空间，但接受调研的人士并不讳言行业困境。

        <updated>2025-10-02T04:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[On September 12, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States announced a joint road map for ending Sudan’s devastating two-and-a-half-year civil war. The announcement, on its own terms, was a breakthrough. Soon after its outbreak in Khartoum in April 2023, the conflict entangled a variety of regional actors. Egypt and a number of other nearby states have supported General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the government now based in Port Sudan; the UAE—and, increasingly, other countries that depend on Abu Dhabi, such as Chad—has backed Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti), the leader of the rebel Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who had been Burhan’s deputy in Sudan’s previous military junta.
The sponsors of the plan, known collectively as the Quad, are thus Arab powers that have a great deal of sway in Sudan (including Saudi Arabia, which has mostly sought to remain neutral) and the United States. Brokering such an agreement among these outside countries had long proved elusive, and it took months of high-level U.S.-led negotiations to reach agreement on a joint road map. The plan called for a three-month humanitarian truce between the two warring factions. This would be followed by a permanent cease-fire and a political process led by the Sudanese to choose a new civilian-led government.
After years of vicious fighting, hope surged that there might finally be a way to end a catastrophe that has killed up to 150,000, displaced a quarter of the country’s population of 50 million, and left innumerable Sudanese without essential services. Yet the plan already appears to be stalling. The fighting in Sudan has continued to rage, and the SAF has publicly rejected the proposal. Bringing Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE into closer alignment was a necessary first step, but a chasm still separates the warring sides. It also remains unclear whether the new U.S. administration is prepared for the difficult long-term engagement that would be needed to bring the plan to fruition.
Indeed, amid a wider U.S. retreat from the region and the rise of ambitious middle powers nearby, the larger story is that the United States no longer possesses the clout it once had to underwrite mediation processes in many parts of Africa, necessitating unwieldy formats such as the Quad. Among outside actors, Washington had by far the greatest influence over the Horn of Africa in the 1990s and the first decade of this century. Although it overreached badly in some of its interventions, it gave peacemaking a center of gravity. 
But over the past 15 years, the United States’ influence has diminished. At the same time, rising regional powers have spotted commercial and diplomatic openings and attempted to pull the Horn of Africa much closer, politically and economically, to the Middle East. This has won the region some needed investment, and some of these powers have proved agile mediators. But the Gulf’s sponsorship of warring parties has, on the whole, made conflicts much harder to resolve.


In this sense, the war in Sudan has become a harbinger of what more wars could look like in the future: messy and seemingly insoluble, drawing in ever more rival outside powers, each with its own irreconcilable interests. Once they start, these kinds of wars are very difficult to end, because no single actor has the authority to convene all the players or corral the other outside powers. They can be extremely destructive, given the advanced weaponry outsiders can now pour in. And the very competitive dynamic that inflames these conflicts in the first place often dooms them to continue as different countries back competing frameworks or jostle for the right to play peacemaker. Peace deals that do cross the finish line rarely accomplish more than to freeze a fractured status quo.
ANCHOR POINT
The Horn of Africa has long been vulnerable to the influence of broad geopolitical shifts. During the Cold War, the Horn was an epicenter of proxy wars between the United States and the Soviet Union; as the Cold War drew to a close, the region experienced political convulsions: regime change in Ethiopia, state collapse in Somalia, and civil wars in Sudan. But although the post–Cold War era started with a shock, it stabilized somewhat as the United States became the dominant source of outside influence. Using plentiful sticks and carrots as well as diplomatic muscle at the regional level, Washington came to play an outsize role in attempting to stabilize the volatile Horn.
Its record was very checkered: in the years since the United States greenlighted a 2006 Ethiopian invasion of Somalia, an Islamist insurgency has taken over swaths of the country. Beginning in the 1990s in Sudan, the United States helped back a southern-based insurgency to put pressure on the Islamist government in Khartoum, resulting in South Sudan’s secession. The new nation quickly slipped into civil war, and northern Sudan struggled economically. More generally, the United States’ liberalizing agenda did little to bolster weak states’ governance.
Still, the United States’ relative hegemony and consistent engagement helped shore up basic interstate stability and centralize peacemaking efforts. Although border disputes between Horn states festered, few local leaders risked the censure that would come with efforts to outright annex neighboring territory. When border wars or major civil wars broke out, the United States steered attempts toward diplomatic resolutions, often by backing multilateral efforts. U.S. officials, for instance, threw their support behind the Algiers agreement (crafted by the UN and the Organization of African Unity) that Ethiopia and Eritrea signed in 2000. The crisis in Darfur in the early years of the twentieth century drew the attention both of U.S. leaders and the American public, and Washington pressured Sudanese negotiators to accept the 2005 Kenyan-led peace process that ended Sudan’s previous civil war and closely coordinated with the African Union’s oversight of the partition of Sudan and South Sudan. In 2012, U.S. pressure was key in stopping a short-lived invasion of Sudan by South Sudan, which risked becoming a new interstate war.
European countries largely followed the United States’ lead in Sudan, and regional powers mostly did not challenge U.S.-backed diplomatic processes. When a proposed multilateral peace effort did not have U.S. backing (such as the African Union’s 2011 attempt to mediate in Libya before the fall of Muammar al-Qaddafi’s regime), it rarely gained traction.
CONTINENTAL DRIFT
But in the past decade, the United States’ ability to shape the international approach to Sudan has steadily declined. As the United States repeatedly tried to turn its focus toward China and remained intractably entangled in Middle Eastern disputes, the stability of the Horn slid down Washington’s priority list—a “nice to have,” but not essential. U.S. President Barack Obama’s special envoy to Sudan and South Sudan, Princeton Lyman, ran a large office with more than 20 staff members, including some detailed from the Defense and Treasury Departments, and reported directly to the White House—a far cry from the resources afforded to more recent U.S. special envoys to the region, who lack teams and report to the State Department’s Africa bureau.
And where the United States mostly saw problems and headaches to solve, some regional middle powers saw fresh opportunities. The United States had sent foreign aid managed by its own bureaucracies, but the Gulf powers and Turkey began to offer the Horn direct investment. In 2006, the Emirates-based logistics giant Dubai Ports World won a 30-year contract to operate Djibouti’s main port, launching a wider effort by Abu Dhabi to control ports across eastern Africa. Its infrastructure investments then expanded inland to include mineral deals, energy projects, and trade corridors in a variety of countries. Turkey, for its part, also put resources into new commercial and security partnerships across the Horn of Africa, especially in countries with territory that had once been linked to the Ottoman Empire.


A scramble for influence in the Horn intensified following the 2011 Arab Spring. Saudi Arabia and the UAE blamed Qatar and Turkey for backing the popular uprising. Each country’s effort to diminish Qatar’s power involved trying to box it out of the Horn and pressure states in that region to choose sides. They also ramped up their commercial investments. According to an April 2024 World Economic Forum memo, over the past decade, the UAE has poured $59 billion into Africa, making it the continent’s fourth largest foreign direct investor (nearly catching up with China, the EU, and the United States), while Saudi Arabia has invested $26 billion; many of these investments are concentrated in the Horn. And as Gulf powers began to question the longevity of U.S. security commitments in the Middle East, some worked to more intentionally build influence across the Red Sea that could protect their interests.
A feedback loop emerged. Waning U.S. engagement with the Horn and other parts of Africa widened the space for middle powers’ own interventions, and middle powers’ growing influence then diminished the United States’ return on its diplomatic investments, hastening its strategic retreat. These middle powers infused foreign direct investment into the Horn and sometimes sought to help resolve conflicts. Qatar, for instance, recently helped mediate a de-escalation between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, and last year, Turkey calmed tensions between Ethiopia and Somalia. But inevitably, different efforts also competed or sometimes worked at cross-purposes, driving instability.
CENTER SPREAD
Sudan has become the epicenter of this middle-power contest. Its rich agricultural land along the Nile and its strategic location at the juncture of the African and Arab worlds—connecting central Africa to the Red Sea and eastern Africa—make it hugely important to nearby powers’ economies and security. In 2018, the disastrous three-decade reign of Sudan’s Islamist dictator, Omar al-Bashir, ran out of steam when a revolt begun by Sudanese youth ousted him. A fledgling civilian government was established, which Washington had every interest in helping succeed.
This was a historic chance for Sudan. After Burhan and Hemedti, the military leaders, imposed a junta in the wake of Bashir’s downfall, the United States as well as some European and African countries made some effort to back the civilian leaders and protesters in the street. They helped broker a power-sharing deal between the junta and civilian politicians that included an eventual transition to full civilian rule.
But the region’s changing power dynamic favored the generals, who had close ties with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. And the United States (as well as Europe) failed to seize the moment to back Sudan’s civilian transition: for instance, Washington failed to lift its Bashir-era financial restrictions on Khartoum until December 2020, weakening the civilian administration in its infancy. In 2021, Burhan and Hemedti ousted the short-lived transitional government in a coup.
After war broke out two years later between Burhan’s SAF and Hemedti’s RSF, Egypt immediately increased its public and covert support for the SAF. And the SAF won new support, including from Turkey (which, like the UAE, seeks to control a Red Sea port in Sudan), as well as Algeria, Iran, and Qatar. These countries all recognized Burhan’s regime as Sudan’s legitimate government.

The UAE continues to deny that it is arming and funding the RSF. But African, Arab, U.S., and European officials widely believe that the UAE is behind the massive logistical operation that has kept the RSF supplied. The group’s main supply route currently runs through Libyan territory controlled by the powerful general and politician Khalifa Haftar, a close UAE ally. Although the UAE has numerous interests in Sudan (including gold), it is easy to overstate the degree to which its involvement in the conflict constitutes a resource grab. Its efforts appear driven by a much broader desire to project power through economic might, including across northern, central, and eastern Africa—and an apparent refusal to create a precedent by abandoning a bellicose proxy. The UAE has also publicly taken issue with Burhan’s tactical wartime alliance with former Bashir officials, given Abu Dhabi’s aversion to Islamist ideology.
Officially, Saudi Arabia has remained neutral in the Sudanese conflict. But it has boosted its diplomatic and economic support to the SAF, including by closely advising its leadership and arguing its case in international forums. Eastern Sudan sits just across the Red Sea from Jeddah, Mecca, and many huge development projects further north on Saudi Arabia’s coast. Riyadh fears that if the Sudanese state collapses entirely, its adversaries could gain a foothold there and instability could spill into the Red Sea, driving insecurity, trafficking, and extremism and reducing its ability to capitalize on the Saudi coast’s potential as a logistics and tourism hub. It also worries about further spillover into Egypt, a key ally.
This tangle of outside influence reflects a continent-wide trend. In a 2024 report, the Peace Research Institute Oslo found that over the previous decade, the number of conflicts in Africa had doubled and that “civil conflicts have become increasingly internationalized.” The report went on: “One or more third-party governments are involved in the conflict through contributing or deploying combat personnel in support of the objective of either side.”
WAR WITHOUT PEACE
Even as it has expanded, the conflict is polarizing the region into two main blocs, pro-SAF and pro-RSF. Eritrea is now providing direct support to the SAF, while Djibouti provides rhetorical support. In May, Djiboutian President Ismail Omar Guelleh, in a rare media interview, accused the UAE of destabilizing the region. Eritrea’s reclusive president, Isaias Afwerki, followed suit. Meanwhile, Chad, the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Kenya, eastern Libya, parts of Somalia, South Sudan, and Uganda—all of which have key financial or security relationships with the UAE—are friendly with the RSF, although some (such as Ethiopia and South Sudan) have attempted to maintain neutrality.


This loose arrangement of blocs, however, does not make the conflict simpler to resolve. The tangle of regional interests has not only aggravated the war, enabling both the RSF and the SAF to continue fighting despite defeats, but has also rendered peacemaking all but impossible. The conflict could not be nipped in the bud because various powers competed to play mediator. And mediation efforts have lacked a center of gravity. In the first six months after the conflict broke out, U.S. and Saudi officials teamed up to try to broker peace between the RSF and the SAF. This process sidelined Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, and two rounds of talks in Jeddah made little progress.
Heads of state from Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Kenya almost succeeded in getting Burhan and Hemedti to sit down face to face in December 2023. But without the backing of key Arab countries, that initiative failed, as did a mediation effort by Egypt and the UAE in early 2024. An August 2024 U.S. effort to organize peace talks in Switzerland fizzled out after the SAF, facing insufficient collective pressure from its Arab allies to attend, refused to show up.
The second Trump administration has shifted tack and tried to focus on getting Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE aligned on how the war should end. This effort began in June and has been spearheaded by Massad Boulos, the U.S. special adviser for Africa and Tiffany Trump’s father-in-law. But even after the mid-September announcement that an agreement had been reached, Burhan distanced himself from the proposal and the RSF ramped up its military offensives.
Peacemaking has not only become more complex in Sudan; it has also necessarily become less ambitious. The greater the number of interests that require accommodation, the smaller the area of overlap between all of their demands. Comprehensive peace deals (such as the 2005 agreement that ended Sudan’s prior civil war) have been replaced by cease-fires that do little more than freeze a status quo, because that is all that everyone can agree on.
TEAM OF RIVALS?
As peacemaking—and even the achievement of a cease-fire—struggles in Sudan, its devastating war continues to escalate. Newer and larger weapons are still pouring into the country, including advanced drones and counterdrone technologies. In May, for instance, after the SAF recaptured Khartoum, the RSF launched long-range drone strikes on Port Sudan, which sits just across the Red Sea from Jeddah—a dramatic expansion of the war’s ambit. The war has already collapsed Khartoum and expelled its professional, educated, and creative classes into the diaspora. No outside power alone has the sway to force the belligerents to the table. Even if an effort by the Trump administration to mediate makes more headway, it will rely on regional powers’ decision to choose peace over war.
And the war’s relentless trajectory suggests that regional competition could jump across Sudan’s borders. Ethiopia and Eritrea have maintained a fragile peace since a war between the two countries ended in 2000, but tension between them is steadily rising, provoking fears that a new interstate war will break out. A new war between Ethiopia and Eritrea could prove even more deadly than Sudan’s conflict and could easily merge with the war in Sudan, given the region’s existing polarization: Djibouti, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia would likely side with Eritrea, while the UAE is Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s most important foreign ally.

 No outside power alone has the sway to force Sudan’s belligerents to the table.
The discourse about an emerging multipolar world often assumes that its main flash points will arise from competition between great powers—China and Russia, as well as the United States. The Sudanese case shows how unmanageable conflicts may emerge outside these countries’ core spheres of influence. In the Horn, numerous rising regional middle powers with different but overlapping interests and leverage are increasingly outmuscling China and Russia, whose interventions in the region are still limited.


In August, the RSF swore in its own parallel, Darfur-based Sudanese government. This move deepened the de facto partitioning of the country into two separate zones of administration, creating fresh barriers to any attempt to piece Sudan back together. The United States will still be indispensable to efforts to reverse such a de facto partition, not least because it remains the lone superpower interested in doing so.
Sudan’s disaster could become a bitter but valuable lesson on overreach for regional powers, prompting them to learn how to manage their competition, ideally without relying so heavily on the United States as a middleman. But the prospect of playing a smaller role must not be an excuse for the United States to walk away. Some in Washington argue that because influencing peacemaking in the Horn is harder than it used to be, the U.S. government should pull way back. But that will only encourage even more instability.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[For decades, U.S. foreign policy has depended on credibility: the belief that Washington would honor its commitments and that its past behavior signaled its future conduct. The United States, for instance, was able to develop a large network of allies because its partners trusted that, if attacked, Washington would defend them. It could strike free-trade deals with countries around the world and negotiate peace agreements because, generally speaking, it was seen as an honest broker. That is not to say the United States has never surprised, or that it never reneged on a promise. But for most of its modern history, it has been a trustworthy actor.
But unlike any U.S. president before him, Donald Trump has abandoned all efforts to make Washington reliable or consistent. His predecessors had also, at times, made decisions that undermined American credibility. But Trump’s lack of consistency is of an entirely different magnitude—and appears to be part of a deliberate strategy. He proposes deals before backing down. He promises to end wars before expanding them. He berates U.S. allies and embraces adversaries. With Trump, the only pattern is the lack of one.
Trump’s theory of the case is simple. By keeping friends and foes off balance, the president believes he can secure quick wins, such as modest increases in European defense spending. Trump also thinks that unpredictability affords him greater wiggle room in international affairs by ensuring that allies and adversaries are always second-guessing his next course of action. Finally, Trump thinks that he can frighten and thus deter opponents by appearing unhinged—an idea that political scientists call the madman theory. As Trump once boasted, Chinese President Xi Jinping would never risk a blockade of Taiwan while he is president because Xi “knows I’m fucking crazy.”
As some analysts have pointed out, Trump’s approach has delivered a few temporary international victories. But in the long term, Trump’s approach to global politics is not likely to strengthen the country. Other states will work to flatter Washington for a time, in hopes of avoiding U.S. penalties. But eventually, governments will look to protect themselves by aligning with other countries. The United States’ list of adversaries will, accordingly, grow. Its alliances will weaken. Washington, in other words, could find itself ever more isolated—and without any clear path to reestablishing its reputation.
GOOD NAME
U.S. presidents have consistently argued that, to protect American power, Washington’s commitments need to be credible. Harry Truman, for instance, decided to intervene on the Korean Peninsula in order to check Soviet expansionism. “I remembered how each time that the democracies failed to act, it had encouraged the aggressors to keep going ahead,” he later said, by way of explanation. Lyndon Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam largely out of fear that retreat would signal that Washington wasn’t serious about containing communism. George W. Bush justified the 2007 surge in Iraq on the grounds that withdrawal would undermine U.S. credibility; Barack Obama kept U.S. forces in the country for similar reasons. And when Obama hesitated to enforce his self-proclaimed “redline” against chemical weapons use in Syria, he was pilloried by his critics for emboldening the United States’ enemies. (He later told a journalist that “dropping bombs on someone to prove that you’re willing to drop bombs on someone is just about the worst reason to use force.”) After the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, Joe Biden was also criticized for undermining Washington’s reputation for reliability, resolve, and competence.


What effect these leaders’ decisions actually had on American credibility is unclear. The causal relationship between a state’s decisions and the way those decisions are perceived is complex and fuzzy. The Dartmouth political scientist Daryl Press, for instance, has argued that states look to present interests and capabilities, rather than past behavior, to measure resolve. Other scholars, including Roseanne McManus, have shown that leaders’ reputations for resolve matter only under certain conditions during crises. And research I have done with the political scientist Alex Weisiger shows that countries that have backed down in the past are twice as likely to be challenged in the future. Other research of mine demonstrates that credibility is shaped as much by perceptions of consistency and reputations for resolve, built up over time, as it is by the costly signals that leaders attempt to send and how they are received by adversaries. Leaders, in other words, think back to their past interactions with adversaries in estimating intentions just as much as they take into account the actions those adversaries are taking during a particular crisis.
But when it comes to Trump, these findings are almost beside the point. Whatever it is that scholarship says a government needs to do to establish credibility, Trump is doing the reverse. The president has openly questioned the most sacrosanct of U.S. defense guarantees—NATO’s Article 5 commitment to collective defense—by declaring that if allies do not “pay up,” they cannot expect protection. He has pulled the United States out of multilateral agreements, such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, without regard for reputational costs. He even reneged on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal, which he negotiated and signed during his first term. And he has flipped back and forth between criticizing and praising Russian President Vladimir Putin—one of Washington’s most determined adversaries—with no clear trigger. His recent meeting with Putin in Alaska was a case in point. It was organized hastily and meant to burnish Trump’s reputation as a dealmaker, but he got nothing concrete in return from his Russian counterpart. Most observers say the American president was played.
Trump may be aware of what his behavior is doing to American credibility, or the consequences may elude him. But either way, the reputational costs for consistency and reliability clearly do not affect his decisions. The president does not want to be credible so much as he wants to gain the psychological upper hand to score quick victories. If that requires disregarding long-standing American commitments, so be it. He wants maximum flexibility: the ability to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants to, in order to get his way.
AGENT OF CHAOS
Trump’s unpredictability is clearly intentional. The president relishes in being chaotic and understands that his threatening behavior helps achieve certain aims, such as his trade deals. “We have to be unpredictable,” Trump said when first running for president in 2016. “I don’t want them to know what I’m thinking.”
But that does not mean the president’s behavior is always attached to a strategy. Instead, it is often the byproduct of mood swings—a version of what the scholar Todd Hall calls “emotional diplomacy.” Fear, anger, disappointment, and revenge are now common drivers of American statecraft. It is a fact many countries have discovered the hard way. During his first term, for instance, Trump praised Canada’s then prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and struck a trade agreement with Ottawa. During his second, he accused the country of not doing enough to curb the flow of fentanyl and other narcotics and then hit it with a suite of tariffs. Likewise, Trump repeatedly celebrated his warm relationship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during term one, only to turn on New Delhi after it denied that Washington helped stop its May conflict with Pakistan. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s relationship with Trump, meanwhile, has moved in seemingly the opposite direction. At first, Zelensky incensed Trump by correcting him in a White House meeting, prompting Washington to temporarily suspend aid to Kyiv. But then Zelensky made nice, and last month, Trump declared that he supported Ukraine’s quest to take back all its land from Russia—something he previously declared unachievable.
For foreign leaders, keeping up with Trump’s shifting moods and whims is nearly impossible. But there are a few different strategies they can deploy to try to win the president over, or at least to limit the carnage. The first is flattery—feeding into Trump’s grandiose self-image. This technique has been particularly popular among Washington’s closest partners. In addition to Zelensky, for instance, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte called the U.S. leader a “pragmatic peacemaker” after his August meeting in the White House, almost certainly in an attempt to prevent the president from abandoning the alliance. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, praised Trump’s “decisive leadership” while successfully pressing him to join Israeli airstrikes on Iran. But even neutral countries have sought to play to Trump’s arrogance. Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir, for example, nominated Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize in an effort to split the United States from India.

 Fear, anger, disappointment, and revenge are now common drivers of American statecraft.
Flattery, however, quickly loses its value as more leaders deploy it. If every country flatters Trump, after all, none of them gain leverage. And for countries that have grown angry at being bullied, praising Trump is sometimes too unpalatable to countenance. As a result, some governments have adopted the opposite approach—confrontation. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, for example, has responded with defiance as Trump applies high tariffs to his country and sanctions its judges for convicting former President Jair Bolsonaro over his plot to steal an election. Modi has taken an aggressive line toward Trump, as well. But although these measures can help improve leaders’ popularity at home, they rarely cause Trump to back off, which can then cause domestic backlash of its own. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter had a confrontational phone call with Trump after Washington hit her country with massive tariffs, but when Trump didn’t budge, she was accused by her domestic opponents of mishandling relations.


There is a middle approach between flattery and confrontation: hedging. It involves being flexible and cozying up to multiple major powers, including some U.S. adversaries. Many Latin American countries, for example, are trading and cooperating more with Asia and Europe in the wake of Trump’s election while still working with Washington. Gulf monarchies flatter Trump even as they strengthen ties with China. French President Emmanuel Macron has urged Europe to pursue a course of “strategic autonomy” that weans his country and the continent off their dependence on both China and the United States.
These approaches are not mutually exclusive. Uncertain of how to respond to Trump’s volatility, much of the world flatters Trump one day, confronts him the next, and then hedges the day after. But ultimately, none of these tactics have delivered more than temporary success. Trump continues to shift his approach to the world almost minute by minute, depending on how he feels.
AT WHAT COST
To his credit, Trump has scored some legitimate achievements by being unpredictable. Consider, for example, his bombing of Iran, which set back the country’s nuclear ambitions. When asked whether he would strike Iran after Israel began its bombing campaign, he deliberately waffled. “I may do it, I may not do it,” he said. “I mean, nobody knows what I’m going to do.” The result was uncertainty in Israel and Iran about how they should position themselves. His decision to ultimately intervene militarily was driven by his desire to get rid of perceptions that he was weak and backed down when confronted, as well as by his urge to be seen as a winner. By demonstrating to other countries his willingness to flip quickly and turn on them, Trump may have thus bolstered American deterrence.
His handling of allied defense budgets could also be considered a victory. For decades, American leaders have pushed for the rest of NATO to up its military spending but never challenged Article 5. European countries thus felt relatively little pressure to act. By casting doubt on collective defense, however, Trump was able to inject some urgency, and at the 2025 Hague summit, European allies pledged to raise their defense spending to a remarkable five percent of GDP. The U.S.-European tariff standoff followed a similar script. Under threat of escalating tariffs, Brussels made trade concessions to Washington over this past summer that were once deemed unthinkable, including an agreement to purchase $750 billion worth of U.S. energy. In response, Trump declared victory. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, praised his “decisive leadership.”
But it is unclear to what extent these victories will be lasting. Trump, for example, may have coaxed more defense spending out of Europe, but at the cost of making NATO more fragile. Even though NATO members are spending more on their own security, the alliance’s strength relies primarily on its collective defense guarantees, which Trump has now weakened. After all, if the mighty United States itself will not respond militarily when a NATO ally is attacked, then the alliance will be weaker even if European countries increase their defense budgets. Trump’s tariffs on the continent tell a similar story: Washington may have extracted its economic concessions, but Europe is now increasing its economic and political autonomy. As a result, the United States will soon have less sway with the continent. In fact, it will have less sway over the whole world. As American credibility deteriorates, it may become harder for Washington to negotiate or facilitate peace deals—as it often does—which will result in a more volatile international system.

 Washington will have fewer friends.
Many American politicians, including some Republicans, have warned about the long-term consequences of Trump’s chaotic global decisions. Even if he is succeeded in office by a close political ally, the next U.S. president might try to act in a more predictable manner (particularly if they are even-tempered). But reestablishing American credibility will be easier said than done. A country’s reputation extends beyond its present leader: when Trump repeatedly breaks promises or abruptly shifts course, it deepens skepticism not only about him but also about the reliability of American institutions altogether. And once credibility is lost, it is hard to recover. The next U.S. president, no matter their approach, will inherit allies who flatter but also hedge, adversaries who test and wait, and a system in which the United States’ word simply carries less weight than it once did.
Washington, in other words, will have fewer friends. For many U.S. partners, hedging will become a necessity as flattery loses its effect and direct confrontation becomes too costly. Meanwhile, Washington might acquire new adversaries, as countries spurned by Trump seek defense partnerships with American competitors. Deterrence will grow more costly, as U.S. officials contend with a growing number of threats. And Washington will have to spend more to reassure the allies it still has.


The United States might find itself with fewer close allies even without Trump, as the international system becomes increasingly multipolar. But the current president’s unpredictability is likely hastening this process. Trump may leave office convinced that his unpredictability made Washington stronger and that Americans will benefit from the resulting configurations of power and transactional deals. He may think that, by rejecting the need for credibility, he freed the United States from constraints that tied the hands of previous presidents. But history is likely to show otherwise: that Trump replaced credibility with volatility, leaving behind a United States that is less trusted.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[对可能发生的“热钱”的冲击绝不能掉以轻心。
   
9月17日，美联储宣布降息0.25个百分点，将联邦基金目标利率降至4%～4.25%区间，开启了本轮降息的第二阶段。不同于纾困式降息，本次实施的降息为预防式降息，即在经济出现局部放缓迹象时，央行为预防潜在的经济金融风险爆发而前瞻实施的相对温和降息举措，在一定程度上起到未雨绸缪的作用。
预计今年剩下一个季度的时间内，美联储仍可能推进温和降息，即1-2次，降幅为0.25-0.5个百分点；降幅多大，主要看经济增长和通货膨胀的态势。当经济增长和就业状况明显走弱，而通胀状态较为温和时，降息可能2次，降幅0.5个百分点左右；如果增长和就业较为平稳，而通胀却明显回升，则可能降息1次，降幅0.25个百分点。下一阶段，美联储货币政策主要在刺激经济和防控通胀两大目标之间寻求平衡。
通常，美联储降息对股市较为友好，尤其是预防式降息有助于提高融资可获得性，减少企业融资成本，激活并购交易，抑制金融市场风险溢价等。但本轮降息第二阶段重启对全球股市的积极影响不宜高估。
今年以来，全球股市在资金流向上出现了一系列值得关注的重要变化：
首先是美国股市资金持续流出。美国投资公司协会（ICI）公布的数据显示，今年上半年，投资于美股的美国长期股票型共同基金出现大规模资金外流，累计净流出约2590亿美元。7月净流出额更是高达3574.3亿美元，远超6月的616.5亿美元。流出的很大一部分资金其实是从美国股市流向美国债券市场和货币市场。美国本土债券型基金7月获得368.2亿美元净流入，较6月142.2亿美元的净流入规模大幅增加；货币基金7月净流入529.5亿美元，是6月的3倍。
事实上，从美国股市流向其他国家股市的资金规模较为有限。据统计，7月除美国以外的全球股票基金获得了136亿美元的流入，创下了自2021年12月以来的最高纪录，但就绝对规模来看，依然较为有限。与此同时，7月全球多家基金、投行的基金经理和客户仍将其资金中对美股的配置比例保持在60%左右，或仅小幅下调，这表明尽管资金从美国股市流出现象的确存在，但在全球资金整体布局中，美股依然占据主导地位。
亚洲、欧洲的股市接受了相对较多的美国股市流出资金。中国国家外汇管理局数据显示，2025年上半年外资净增持境内股票和基金101亿美元，扭转了过去两年总体净减持的态势。其中5、6月份，净增持规模增至188亿美元，显示全球资本配置中国境内股市的意愿显著增强。在外资流入、货币宽松等积极因素的推动下，德国、西班牙和意大利等欧洲国家的股市今年均实现了两位数的涨幅。4月以来，外资持续流入日本股市，包括桥水在内的全球顶级基金纷纷调仓布局日股。
当前美股资金流出的主要方向是“资产配置再平衡”。美股资金外流确实存在，且规模不小，但主要流向美国境内的债券和货币市场，是从风险较高的权益类资产转向稳健型资产，而非大规模转战海外股市。换言之，投资者行为更偏向“避险”而非“换市”，反映出投资者对美国经济和就业疲弱、政府债务压力不断增大、美股高估值、政策不确定性等因素的担忧，是一种风险偏好水平下降的表现。
尽管美国以外的全球股市的确吸引了部分资金，尤其是欧洲、中国等市场的吸引力明显增强，但规模相对有限，更多仍体现为“结构性机会”。其实质性的原因在于，非美市场并未形成有效的吸引力：欧洲经济受地缘冲突影响，持续低速增长，投资风险较大。中国经济受到关税战、全球产业链重整等外部压力；内部经济基本面尚未呈现强势，内需依然不足，境外投资者依然认为仍存在不确定性，市场的国际吸引力提升需要有个过程。其他经济体的规模较为有限，也难成气候。当前资金从美股流向非美市场，很大程度上是出于估值修复、政策催化与美元走弱下的战术性调仓，而非对美股长期趋势失去信心。未来是否会出现更大规模的资金流出浪潮，还有待进一步观察。
未来一个阶段，当美联储继续采取较为温和的预防式降息策略时，美国股市多数资金可能仍将停留在美国金融市场“内循环”，但一部分“聪明的钱”可能会流出美国，在全球范围内寻找优质资产和低估值资产。其中，欧洲、日本等发达市场受益更为普遍，而新兴市场则更多表现为结构性流入。中国市场的吸引力将视内需发展状况而变化。
当美联储在特朗普政府施压下采取激进大幅降息策略时，全球股市可能会因流动性泛滥而阶段性（如3-6个月）出现普遍受益的局面。不但与美股走势高度相关的欧洲、日本等发达经济体股市将受到美国股市的推动，中国、印度、东盟等新兴市场股市也将不同程度承接更多短期跨境资本，即“热钱”流入的冲击，同时本国利率政策也将获得更大的下调空间。
历史经验揭示，对一个经济体来说，“热钱”快速且大规模流入并非好事。需要警惕的是，一旦美国货币政策在通胀大幅反弹压力推动下被迫收紧时，由于利率剪刀差迅速拉大叠加美元指数快速走强，“热钱”很可能急剧转向流出，从而对全球股市带来重大负面冲击，尤其是一些经常账户赤字、外债占比高的新兴经济体（如阿根廷、土耳其、印尼、巴西、南非等）的股市很可能应声而落、遭受重挫。
近年来，我国股市的开放程度不断扩大，对可能发生的“热钱”的冲击绝不能掉以轻心。（作者系广开首席产业研究院院长、中国首席经济学家论坛理事长）]]></content>

India's strong batting order has raised hopes as the team seeks maiden world title

Published
2 October 2025




The Indian women's team has kicked off their ICC ODI World Cup campaign with a 99-run victory over Sri Lanka. 
The margin of victory might suggest a facile win, but it was not easy going for Harmanpreet Kaur and her team as the underrated Lankans showed fine skills and abundant spirit through the match.
At one stage, batting first, India were reduced to a precarious 124-6, the strong top order back in the pavilion in an ungratifying sequence of unforced errors, with an unexpected setback looming over the stadium in Guwahati city. 
It took a brave, stroke-filled partnership of 103 for the seventh wicket between all-rounders Deepti Sharma and Amanjot Kaur that helped India reach 269, which proved beyond the Lankans.
The win ensured important points but raised some searching questions about the top order batting, widely considered as the strongest aspect of the team as India seek their maiden world title having finished runners up twice in World Cups in the last decade.

India won the opening match against Sri Lanka on Tuesday 


In the 2017 ODI World Cup, after a string of impressive wins, including a stirring one over Australia in the semi-final, India fizzled out against England in the final.
In the 2020 T20 World Cup final at Melbourne in front of a record crowd of more than 85,000 India fell apart against home team Australia.
Despite not winning the title, reaching the final in the 2017 and 2020 editions put India in the upper echelons of women's cricket. The Indian team has since been a force to reckon with.
Women's cricket in India goes back more than half a century. The Women's Cricket Association of India came into existence in 1973. The national team played its first Test in 1976 against West Indies.
But the next three decades and more were defined by an utter lack of support for women's cricket from the cricket establishment, sponsors and fans.
While the country threw up some high quality players like Shantha Rangaswamy, Diana Eduljee, Shubhangi Kulkarni and Fouzia Khaleeli, women's cricket in India wallowed in penury and a lack of playing opportunities.
The turning point came in 2006-2007 when the BCCI, heeding the ICC's programme to develop women's cricket, integrated it into the Board.
This opened up access to resources - financial and infrastructure facilities, providing security and opportunity, which not only made the players feel wanted, but also triggered off the desire to excel. Most importantly, this meant they could play overseas matches, which was earlier rare.
The prowess of Indian women cricket has started coming through clearly ever since. The exploits of ace batter Mithali Raj, who holds the record for most runs in a sterling 20-year career, and pace bowler Jhulan Goswami who has sundry milestones to her credit too, earned Indian women's cricket global encomiums.
In the past decade, stellar performances by the likes of Harmanpreet Kaur, Smriti Mandhana, Jemima Rodrigues, Richa Ghosh, Deepti Sharma and others saw Indian women's cricket's stock rise rapidly and higher.
The BCCI's decision to introduce pay parity between male and female players for all formats went a long way in boosting the self-esteem of women cricketers. The launch of the Women's Premier League, a sister version of the IPL although with fewer teams and considerably lower fiscal muscle, has seen an explosion in fan interest. These factors have triggered a massive interest in young girls to play the sport, opening up a robust pipeline for talent from across the country.
Women's cricket in India is blooming, but will reach stratospheric heights if Harmanpreet Kaur and her team can win the ODI World Cup, says former captain Diana Eduljee.
"It can have an impact similar to what happened when Kapil Dev's team won the 1983 Prudential Cup," she says.
But can India break the jinx this time and win the World Cup?

Stellar performances by women batters, including Smriti Mandhana, have helped women's cricket grow in India


Much of the discussion so far has focused on the team's upcoming match against Pakistan on Sunday in Colombo - it comes at a time when conversation around the melodrama surrounding the recent India-Pakistan men's match during Asia Cup final is dominating headlines.
But in women's cricket, India's record against Pakistan is overwhelmingly superior. The real threat for India in the World Cup comes from other teams.
ICC rankings have Australia at number one. India were number three, but have edged ahead of England after the victory against Sri Lanka. But England, New Zealand and South Africa can't be taken lightly.
Experts say that India has the talent and experience to take on all of them and playing at home gives them an extra advantage.
Also, India's lead-in form has been impressive. In June, India beat England in a T20 series there for the first time. Though the format was different, the result should give some psychological advantage in the ODIs too.
In a World Cup warm-up series against old nemesis Australia, India lost 1-2, but matched the Aussies blow-for-blow right through.
Matching the Aussies on talent alone may not be enough to win the title though. India will need to show steely nerves, sustained form, fitness and mental toughness and deep ambition to make this campaign path-breaking.
Beating Sri Lanka on Tuesday was a great start but the road to the title is strewn with many stiff challenges.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[“一个创始人管理一群AI智能体”。
   
2024年初，OpenAI CEO奥尔特曼（Sam Altman）提出，AI 时代，很快就会出现估值10 亿美元的一人独角兽公司（"1-Person" Billion Dollar Company）。这在当时听起来很遥远，但在今天这一预测已越来越近了。
在海外，一份“顶尖精益AI 原生公司”的榜单颇受关注，该榜单长期追踪团队规模较小、但营收可观的初创公司，以衡量我们距离“一人十亿美元”创业现实还有多远，在榜单中，44家公司的平均团队规模为27人，但年度总收入达到近38亿美元，单个员工的估值超过1亿美元。

2025年，Agent（智能体）能力逐步深入行业，越来越多人开始相信一人独角兽公司的未来。在近日长江CEO 20周年论坛上，阿里前总参谋长、长江商学院前战略管理教授曾鸣表示，智能组织会成为未来十年主流的组织形式，未来公司核心员工大多不会超过百人，个人能力的优势被极限放大，传统的管理思路受到越来越大的挑战。
传统公司的结构是”人管理人”，但在以AI为核心的公司中，这个模式变成了“一个创始人管理一群AI Agent”。 在AI时代，传统人力密集型企业将受到更多挑战，长江商学院科技与运营教授孙天澍判断，那些企业领先的核心优势可能未来也会变成核心负债。
“一人独角兽”更近了
9月30日，Anthropic 发布Claude Sonnet 4.5，称其为“世界上最好的编程模型”，可以连续从事复杂工作超30小时，在编程、数学能力超越前一代旗舰模型的同时，价格较其降低了80%。
有行业人士感叹，这样顶尖的编程能力与开发者能够负担得起的价格相结合，预示的可能是“一人公司”的黎明到来。iGent AI的CEO表示，Sonnet 4.5可以自主处理30多个小时的代码，使工程师在极短的时间内处理数月的复杂架构工作，这意味着不再需要过去庞大的团队。
AI编程在过去一年进展迅速，事实上，离一人独角兽公司最近的案例也是在AI编程赛道。
base44是一家位于以色列的氛围编程（Vibe Coding）公司，由90后程序员Maor Shlomo独自创办，从未进行外部融资，去除高昂的大模型token 成本后，5月仍实现了18.9万美元的利润。成立短短6个月base44就被海外互联网巨头Wix以8000万美元收购。
Maor Shlomo曾在采访中提到，他第一个员工是在被收购前一个半月才入职的，大部分时间都是自己在独立运营公司，管理 “AI 团队”来编写代码。他表示，过去三个月内自己几乎没写过一行代码，但 Base44 的前端依然有很大变化，这些代码都是AI编写的。
“随着大模型的进步，像那些 10 倍效率的工程师会产生更大的影响力，他们将成为 100 倍效率的工程师，因为他们能管理大模型。”Maor Shlomo认为，团队规模和资金不是能否在某个领域胜出的必要因素了。
同样作为AI编程领域的明星产品，Cursor母公司Anysphere在12名员工时估值就已经达到4亿美元，目前有约60人，年化收入已达到5亿美元，估值约 99 亿美元。而在文生图领域，明星企业Midjourney仅靠40人团队，就实现年营收5亿美元，至今未融过资，业界预计其估值已高达100亿美元。
在AI时代，涌现的这些创业公司员工人数不多，但造血能力极强。过去，一个复杂的软件项目需要一个从产品经理到工程师的团队，而现在，一个有想法的开发者，加上几个AI Agent，理论上可以独自完成这些环节。
曾鸣接触过很多创业团队，他表示，自己看到的AI团队都非常小。“去年夏天我在硅谷办过一个小型座谈会，一个创业者感慨最头疼的问题是团队太大，管理起来困难。其他创业者问他团队是多少人，回复说30多人，更奇妙的是，其他人都说，真是太多了。”
曾鸣表示，这是去年夏天发生的故事，而在今年夏天，他在硅谷发现，3个人、10个人的团队是极为常见的，而那些团队人员多的创业公司，往往是有一批人在做一些“用机器做成本还太高”的事，没有高附加值。
在这个趋势里，个人能力的优势被AI极限地放大了，曾鸣看到，顶尖AI研究员的学习成本大幅降低，他们可以利用超强的元认知能力和广泛的AI工具，快速学习各种领域的知识，提出原创的解决方案。
“今天一个好的研究员就可以调用千万个Agent，能够创造特别多价值。原本一个产品需要七八个工种前后协调才能做出来，现在一个人就可以做，不需要专门的产品经理、技术、研发、测试这些环节。”曾鸣判断，一个人可以适应多个岗位后，未来的组织形态会发生根本性的变化，也会越来越智能。
不过，Maor Shlomo认为，独立创业也并不适合所有类型的公司，如果要创办一家 B2B企业服务公司，需要组建销售团队、投入营销预算，那单打独斗会非常困难。但如果开发的是具有病毒式传播潜力的产品，能够快速实现产品市场匹配，独立创业会更具优势。
“AI+”而非“+AI”
“一个5000人的企业想缩小到50人，和一个从0开始的创业公司扩大到50人，难度是不一样的。”孙天澍提到，如娱乐行业、服务行业，甚至教育行业，很多传统人力密集型的企业，过去领先的核心优势未来或许会变成核心负债。庞大的组织规模使其难以迅速调转船头。
SparkXGlobal创始人袁俊长期在美国，他发现，海外企业都在快速地往AI转型，越大的企业拥抱AI的主动性就更强，从传统人力的工作模式在变成SaaS管理的模式，但国内还是人力密集型的模式，一个300人左右的企业量级，和美国40-50人的企业量级差不多，人效的比例是四至五倍的差距。
“（国内）很多企业都还没有用过SaaS，去用AI Agent很难。”袁俊认为，企业本身的组织力管理、CEO一号位思维等，造成了现在节奏上的不适配。CEO需要能驱动整个企业在运营管理层面往AI的方向转型，跟随AI Agent能力的去迭代业务模型。
不少行业人士都观察到企业转型思维上的差别。Marketingforce迈富时创始人赵旭隆发现，国内如火如荼地在推进AI产业，但只是ToC端、小公司转型更积极，大中型企业在应用AI和智能体的时候较为困难。
一方面，业务都在整个组织架构流程中进行，突然要推倒，用AI原生的方式，没有人敢承担责任，此外，高层管理人员的认知也还未拉齐，要推动AI转型的人也并不一定会从全局的角度考虑。因此，这些大中型企业在拥抱AI的时候，往往会从局部、半自动开始。
孙天澍也观察到，95%的企业选择的是“业务+AI”，即在已有流程的基础上，让AI融入某个环节做优化和改造。 “就像企业来了一个新员工，企业不会变，新员工必须适应企业。”他表示，这种情况下能释放的价值很小，因为企业并没有重构。
孙天澍提出，现在的AI并不是工具，而是智能本身，“AI+”是以智能体为中心，去思考如何将其无限记忆的能力释放出来，AI原生的架构非常重要。他认为，AI时代巨大的红利和互联网时代巨大的红利都有一个类似的特点，最终原生企业抢到大部分的价值。
例如，在移动互联网时代，字节跳动用抖音这样的产品真正释放了智能手机的手指交互能力，这在PC端是无法实现的。滴滴则是用移动原生的模式围绕着实时可取的位置数据，重构了这个行业的关系。
“今天很多企业在做的事情和出租车公司很像，可能在企业里面做了一些局部改造，但是当这个产业真正发生重构时，AI原生的企业会形成降维打击，AI会重构整个行业的逻辑。”孙天澍认为， AI时代怎样释放出原生的活力很重要。
AI世界里有一道巨大的鸿沟。8月，麻省理工学院的NANDA项目组发布了一份名为《The GenAI Divide》（生成式AI鸿沟）的深度报告，他们调研了52家组织和300多个AI项目后，得出一个结论：尽管全球企业已投入300-400亿美元，但高达95%的组织在生成式AI上获得了零回报，只有约 5% 的 AI 试点项目实现了收入的快速增长。
生成式AI鸿沟并非源于投资或兴趣不足，而是受制于现有信息孤岛与异构系统环境，不能将AI融入核心业务流程以产生可衡量的收益影响。许多公司在试点AI方案，极少能规模化部署。
报告总结建议，AI项目失败并非技术本身，而是企业整合与落地能力不足。企业需要进行全面内部评估，确保数据基础设施与员工技能支持AI应用。我们仍处于更大转型的早期，需要的不只是新工具，更是新的工作方式。
我们正处在一场组织革命的开端，未来真正的赢家，不会是那些把AI当作工具嵌入旧流程的公司，而是那些以智能为内核、重构业务逻辑的创新者。]]></content>

Published

When China first announced a new visa targeting foreign professionals in science and technology in August it largely went unnoticed.
But the K visa, which went into effect on Wednesday, was thrust into the public spotlight last week, when an Indian outlet referred to it as "China's H-1B" - a reference to the US visa for skilled workers which was, last month, targeted by an executive order by Donald Trump. Indians dominate the H-1B programme, making up more than 70% of the recipients in recent years.
The Indian media report was picked up widely in China, stoking concern - and even fears - amongst the public over whether benefits extended to foreigners would increase competition in a sluggish job market - and in a country that has traditionally not been a major immigration destination for foreign professionals.
And although it is still unclear whether the visa will actually allow foreigners to work in China or whether it just allows them easier access into the country, it didn't stop tens of thousands of users on Chinese social media from criticising the programme.
"We have so many bachelor's degree holders, not to mention even more with master's and doctoral degrees. We already have a surplus of domestic talent - and now you're bringing in foreign college graduates?" read one comment.
“There have been so many new programmes pushing our university students to compete with each other, but in the end, nothing beats a foreign passport,” another Weibo user wrote.

News about the K visa stoked fears amongst the public


Others talked about whether authorities could bring in a high standard of talent, and questioned  whether foreigners would be able to adapt to life on the mainland, citing language barriers and China's tightly controlled political system.
Also among the comments were a wave of xenophobic and racist remarks - many of them targeted specifically at Indian nationals.
The backlash has been so intense that state media outlets have stepped in to try to calm the waters.
On Monday, the Global Times published a commentary advocating the scheme as an opportunity "for the world to see a more open and confident China in its new era".
And on Tuesday, the People's Daily published a commentary titled "Misrepresenting the K visa will only mislead the public".
"As China steps onto the global stage, it is hungrier for talent than ever before," the article adds.


What is the K visa?


It is not yet clear what the programme fully entails, but the Chinese government has said it applies to individuals working in STEM fields - science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
Authorities have described it as a visa for "exchanges related to education, science and technology, culture, as well as entrepreneurship and business activities".
In a government media release in August, it said that applicants for the K visa should be those "who have graduated from well-known universities or research institutions in China or abroad with a bachelor's or higher degree in a STEM field, or who teach or conduct research work at those institutions".
It did not provide further details on age requirements or which universities would qualify for the scheme.
Notably, foreign professionals will not need backing from a local employer to be granted the visa - and will enjoy more flexibility in terms of the number of entries, validity period and duration of stay.

And state media, while attempting to address public anxiety, have stopped short of clarifying the exact scope of activities the visa covers, failing to answer the real question that is undoubtedly on the minds of many - will it allow qualified foreigners to work in China?
In its article earlier this week, the Global Times pointed out that the K visa would not be the same as an H-1B, stating that it was "not a simple work permit".
The People's Daily also weighed in, saying that the visa would "provide convenience for young foreign science and technology professionals to work and live in China" - but stressed that it "should not be equated with immigration".
The Chinese foreign ministry has said that more details about the visa will be released by Chinese embassies and consulates abroad, without specifying a timeline.



China's ambitions and limits


What is clear is China is seizing the momentum as the US pulls back from its position as a top destination for international talent and visitors.
The official launch of the K visa - though the timing was set two months ago - coincides with the Trump administration's sharp increase in application fees for the H-1B programme, a move that has sparked uproar in countries like India and China - two of the largest sources of skilled workers to the US.
This is just the latest step in China's broader effort to attract foreigners to the country - whether for tourism, research or business.
As of July, China had visa exemption agreements with 75 countries to make visiting the country easier for foreign tourists. Its push to attract top academics has already led some high-profile scholars to leave US institutions and join Chinese universities.
"At a time when some countries are turning inward and excluding international talent, China has keenly seized this important opportunity and promptly introduced relevant policies," the People's Daily commentary reads.
But the initiative is not without its limitations, experts say.
The online backlash reflects a pattern of public scrutiny and criticism in China over what is perceived as preferential treatment for foreigners, according to Giulia Interesse, an editor at business intelligence platform Asia Briefing. 
While discourse on social media may not fully represent public sentiment at large, the controversy highlights that "implementation is not only a matter of regulatory design, but also of public communication and domestic consensus-building," she says.
Language is another barrier. Many researchers and academics who have left the US for China in recent years are ethnic Chinese and fluent in Mandarin.
But for foreign talent more broadly, communication with Chinese colleagues remains a challenge - one that both employers and employees will need to address.
The bigger concern, however, is whether foreign science and tech professionals can adapt to China's tightly controlled political environment, says Stefanie Kam, assistant professor at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.
"Creativity and innovation [flourishes] in an open and liberal climate as we see in cases in the US and many European nations. But with the current trajectory in China, we're seeing the opposite," she tells the BBC.
Whether or not these foreign professionals will "find that space for creativity innovation" in China remains a key question for those considering the move.

        <updated>2025-10-01T19:12:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[A tireless advocate for conservation and one of the world's most prominent primatologists, Jane Goodall has passed away at 91. In 2019, she spoke with DW about why it's important to protect our environment and wildlife.
    World-renowned primatologist Jane Goodall has died of natural causes Image: H. Retamal/AFP/Getty Images   
In 1960, at the age of 26, Jane Goodall ventured to Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania to study chimpanzees. Her discoveries were groundbreaking and her approach to fieldwork was revolutionary. She immersed herself in the chimps' daily lives and gave them names.
Goodall became a tireless advocate for conservation — in addition to one of the world's best-known primatologists. In 1977, she founded the Jane Goodall Institute, which works around the world to protect wildlife and the environment, but also improves the lives of people in order to further conservation efforts.
In 2019, Goodall spoke with DW about her work and her beliefs. We are republishing the interview after news broke on Wednesday, October 1, 2025, that the conservationist had died at the age of 91 while on a speaking tour of the US.
DW: Why do you think it is that some people lack hope or aren't moved to take action to protect the environment?
Jane Goodall: The biggest problem is greed. People want more and more and more — more than they need. Companies want to grow bigger and bigger and bigger and gobble up the competition. And the gap between the haves and the have-nots is getting bigger all the time, causing resentment and anger, rightly so.
Speaking of that, a lot of your environmental work focuses on lifting people out of poverty. What led you to connect this social justice work with more traditional conservation efforts?
It was back in 1986, when I realized that chimpanzees' numbers in Africa were decreasing and habitat was being destroyed. I decided I should go to a different range of countries and learn more about it, which I managed to do. But at the same time, I was learning about the plight of so many people living in and around chimpanzee habitat: the crippling poverty, the lack of good health and education, the destruction of the environment.

Because when you're very poor, you cut down the last trees to try and desperately grow some more food or make charcoal. It was when I flew over that tiny Gombe National Park and saw what had been part of a great equatorial forest belt stretching from East to West Africa (and that was in 1960). By 1990 when I flew over, it was just a tiny island forest surrounded by completely bare hills and people were struggling to survive. 
That's when I realized if we don't help the people to find other ways of living than destroying the environment, then we can't even try to help the chimps.
And so we began our Jane Goodall Institute TACARE program (take care, T-A-C-A-R-E) and there were a few NGOs at the time sort of handing out bits and pieces to local communities, but we did it rather differently. We selected a small group of local Tanzanians — seven of them — and they went into the villages and asked the people 'What can JGI do to help?' and that's where we began.
A lot of your work and the program, Roots & Shoots, focuses on children and young people. Can you give us some examples of projects that students have done throughout the years that give you hope for the future?
First let me say that that program that began with 12 high school students, is now in about 60 countries with about 150,000 active groups. We've got members in kindergarten and university and everything in between.

The students themselves choose three projects: one to help people, one to help animals, one to help the environment. Because we try and bring them together as much as possible, even if usually it's just virtually, they come to understand that we may have different colored skin, come from different cultures and different religions, but actually underneath we're all human beings. We're all one family.
So some projects? Well, all around the globe, they're planting trees, which they decide to do. Many of them are working very hard to eliminate plastic and to teach about recycling — huge projects on those things going on in China. They sometimes raise money in very imaginative ways and that can be to help a shelter for stray dogs or it can be to help refugees in another country or the same country and it can be for earthquake victims.
It's just as varied as the young people themselves. They choose different projects depending on what country they're in. Sometimes it has to be politically sensitive, what they do. It depends if they're rich or poor, and it depends on their age.
What do you wish more people knew about animals?
That animals like us have feelings, that they have personalities, that they can feel happy or sad, that they can feel pain and fear and despair. And that they're so much more intelligent than we used to think.
Jane Goodall still has hope

Rats are trained to detect landmines. These are the giant forest rats and they've been credited with helping to make Mozambique landmine free. I met so many people from Mozambique who'd lost a leg or a foot from treading on the landmine after the Civil War. Rats are so intelligent.
Octopuses can make houses for themselves out of empty clam shells. They take them to where they want to go hunting if there are no rocks because they need rocks to hide in. So they take two empty clam shells with them and then get into one half and pull the other over their head.
Birds can make tools. You know, all these things we're finding out — it's a very exciting time.
How do you think we as humans can regain our connection to the natural world and better understand our place in it?
That's what we hope to do through Root and Shoots — give children an opportunity to be out in nature. Once they get out in nature, they love it, especially the little ones.
We need the natural world for our good psychological health. We actually need green and to be out in nature.
What do you think is the single most important thing people can do to preserve our planet?
I think that each day people must understand that their life is making a difference and they should start thinking about the consequences of the little choices they make.

Like, what do you buy? Where does it come from? Did it harm the environment? Did it result in animal cruelty, like the factory farms? Is it cheap because of child slave labor? You start making ethical choices — let's not use plastic, let's recycle, let's reuse, let's not throw away, let's not waste food.
Yes, the big corporations and governments can make huge differences, but at least in democracies, the people are responsible for who is elected into power. And if you don't like the way a business works, the consumer has a huge responsibility because if you don't like the way it's made, don't buy it.
That's another reason for eliminating poverty because if you're really poor, you can't choose. You just have to buy the cheapest.
So the most important message is: what do you do each day, and how do you make the most use, and can you go to sleep thinking, 'I made the world a little bit better today'? And people do that in different ways.
I should just finally say that if you fly over Gombe today, you wouldn't see bare hills because the people have understood that preserving the environment is for their own future as well as wildlife. The trees have come back.
It's nice to see those hopeful situations.
That's the only reason I keep going. I meet amazing people and I see incredible projects everywhere.
This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. It was originally published on July 12, 2019, and republished after Goodall's death on October 1, 2025.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The prominent Jewish journalist Michel Friedman was supposed to read from his latest book in the northeastern German town of Klütz — but was uninvited. Did town officials want to placate the far right?

The small town of Klütz, in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in northeastern Germany, had likely never seen a demonstration of this scale. About 500 protesters — among them media representatives, writers and artists — flocked to Klütz, home to about 3,000 people, on Monday to support journalist Michel Friedman. The protest was organized by the German branch of the international writers association PEN after a planned reading by Friedman in the town was surprisingly canceled.
Friedman is a Jewish journalist, talk show host and former member of Germany's conservative CDU party and had previously served as vice-chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. He was born in France but holds German citizenship.
Friedman took the stage on Monday to address his supporters, telling them: "I'm with you now, and I think we fit together very well."
But why was Friedman's reading canceled in the first place? Did local politicians and decision-makers prefer not to have him in their town, fearing his presence may spark far-right riots? Or is the entire affair nothing but a big misunderstanding?
Invited, then uninvited
Friedman was initially invited to read from his new book "Human! Declaration of Love by a Desperate Democrat" at Klütz's Literaturhaus (literature house in English), a local cultural institution. Friedman had been asked to showcase his book, as well as talk about democracy and why it is under threat.
There are different accounts as to why Friedman was uninvited. What is certain is that Klütz Mayor Jürgen Mevius of the Independent Voters' Association (UWG) told Literaturhaus representatives that municipal committees had decided they would rather not have Friedman come to town. Mevius cited financial reasons at a city council meeting, saying Friedman's fee was significantly higher than what is ordinarily paid at Literaturhaus events.

Yet Literaturhaus director Oliver Hintz has maintained that the cost of inviting Friedman and his fee were actually covered by sponsors, rather than the town of Klütz. He says city officials had expressed concerns that Friedman's reading might spark riots by right-wing extremists or Hamas sympathizers.
Ultimately, Mayor Mevius resigned over the affair, saying Friedman's disinvitation had sent a "misleading signal." He also stressed that "tolerance, diversity and freedom of opinion have always been clear guiding principles of our political work."

Friedman story makes headlines across Germany
The cancelation of Friedman's reading was picked up by news media all over Germany ― not least because the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is regarded as a stronghold of the right-wing populist AfD. Elements of the party are classified as far-right extremist. A representative survey conducted by German pollster infratest-dimap in mid-September found that 38% of respondents in the state said they would vote for the AfD in next year's state elections, making it the strongest political force in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.

The German government's antisemitism commissioner, Felix Klein, also commented on the Friedman affair, saying that fundamental societal values had been violated when state authorities revoked the invitation expecting pushback from anti-democratic forces. Friedman himself lambasted Mayor Mevius after the canceled reading in an interview with public broadcaster NDR, accusing Mevius of "embarrassing hypocrisy."


A peaceful protest
Yet on Monday evening, the atmosphere was peaceful in Klütz as protesters gathered in support of the journalist. After a short speech, Friedman engaged in a discussion with local residents, and then took questions from this reporter.
Why did he come to this town after being uninvited a few days earlier?
"Because I'm curious, because I want to talk to the people, rather than talk about Klütz," Friedman replied. "I was uninvited, and I think that's unacceptable. And my first reaction wherever I'm uninvited is to go there as fast as possible."
The exchange was good, Friedman continued. After all, he said, he'd never made sweeping generalizations about the people of Klütz, just as he avoids generalizations about Jewish people.

Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania's Culture Minister Bettina Martin of the Social Democrats also attended the protest, saying uninviting Friedman was a mistake.
"This is a difficult situation for Klütz," Martin told DW. "And in this respect, what is happening right now — a controversial debate in which many citizens are participating — marks the first step in processing this situation."
Many locals regret the resignation of Mayor Mevius, who had been involved in municipal politics for many years. One resident told DW he was "disappointed that such upheavals" were taking place, while another man said uninviting Friedman had been a mistake, regardless who was to blame. An older woman, meanwhile, told DW that the town of Klütz was known for its far-right tendencies, saying she believed that antisemitic motives had led to the uninviting of Jewish journalist Friedman.
Klütz Mayor Mevius, who has resigned, did not address the public on September 29. It will likely be some time before the town returns to peace and quiet.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Populations around the world are aging fast. But, from Steve Martin to Helen Mirren, leading older actors are showing how seniors can have a starring role in healthy and diverse societies.

"All communities and ages benefit from the wisdom of older persons," UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres said. "They have much to teach about navigating uncertainty, resolving conflict and building solidarity across generations."
Speaking on the UN International Day of Older Persons, October 1, a day that promotes a society for all ages, Guterres said: "Older persons are powerful agents of change."
A look at some of the top-rated films and series of recent and past history shows how older actors can have enduring appeal.


Hit Netflix film set in a retirement village
Based on the best-selling novel by Richard Osman, "The Thursday Murder Club" (2025) brings together four retirees who enjoy solving old cold cases; they set out to investigate the murder of one of the owners of their retirement village.
Though some critics claimed that the Netflix film offers a fairly standard whodunit-mystery plot, praise was reserved for the veteran cast, and especially Oscar-winner Dame Helen Mirren — who recently turned 80, and is a year younger than co-star Ben Kingsley. Pierce Brosnan and Celia Imrie, both still only in their 70s, were also applauded.
"Helen Mirren owns the screen with cunning confidence, and Pierce Brosnan carries the charismatic swagger he once brought to James Bond (and that's to say nothing of his incredible hair). Celia Imrie lands a couple of the best laughs with her senior spin on the 'new kid in school' trope," wrote one film reviewer in online entertainment magazine Exclaim.
Of working with the seasoned cast, Ben Kingsley, who won an Oscar for "Ghandi" (1982), talked of an ongoing "love of our craft that is shared."  

Comic legends lead the streaming charts
The US mystery comedy-drama television series "Only Murders in the Building" has been running since 2021, but this month, veteran comedians Steve Martin and Martin Short are back at the helm for a fifth season. A sprightly Martin, now 80, and his diminutive neighbor keep the laughs coming alongside a much younger Selena Gomez as they concoct a true-crime podcast based on a gruesome death inside their exclusive New York apartment building.
Streaming platform Hulu announced in 2021 that "Only Murders in the Building" was the most-watched comedy series ever on its network and has remained among its most popular shows, having racked up scores of awards, including multiple Emmys.

Martin, who also co-created the series—and who also still plays banjo in a band—drives the action with his usual comedic verve. Rolling Stone magazine called the first series "a hilarious true-crime parody and a genuinely exciting play-along mystery, all the way through a wonderful finale."
Interviewed by Jimmy Kimmel in July as he was turning 80, Martin, who also published a book of his writing this year, was asked about becoming an octogenarian.
"I feel very comfortable," he said. "Be honest with yourself … I've decided to embrace it."
"I have a mantra," he added with his usual deadpan wit, "find a mirror you trust," Martin said, quoting the British writer Martin Amis.
Meryl Streep, now 76, also has a supporting role in "Only Murders in the Building," and has also spoken out about aging. "One day you wake up and realize that your youth is gone, but along with it, so go insecurity, haste and the need to please," she once said.

Older people on the big screen
Back in 1993, two 70ish Hollywood legends, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, starred in a surprise summer holiday hit, "Grumpy Old Men," reviving the rare art of slapstick comedic timing with great box office success.
Meanwhile, Clint Eastwood was able to continue his career long behind his "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (1966) and "Dirty Harry" (1971) height with films like "Gran Torino" (2008), which he also directed and was released when he was 78. Eastwood plays a curmudgeonly retired auto worker and Korean War veteran who begins an unlikely friendship with a harassed Hmong teen and his immigrant family.
In the late-career film, Eastwood was able to combine the key themes of his long filmography, such as "family, war, loss, faith and unexpected human connection," noted USA Today.

Most recently, Hollywood A-Listers like George Clooney, the 64-year-old star of "Jay Kelly" (2025), have begun to face their mortality.
"If you can't make peace with aging, then you've got to get out of the business and just disappear," Clooney recently told Vanity Fair.
And as Helen Mirren and Steve Martin illustrate, the show can go on for many older persons.
"My spirit is the age that I am," Mirren said in a recent interview. "When you say 'youthful,' I'm not full of youth. I'm full of the life that I've lived up to this point. I much prefer that phrase. You're so life full."

Published
1 October 2025




Afghans have taken to the streets to rejoice in the restoration of internet and telecom services after the Taliban government shut them down, provoking widespread condemnation.
Local reporters said communications were resuming, while internet monitor Netblocks said network data showed a "partial restoration" of connectivity.
A source close to the government confirmed to BBC Afghan that the internet was back by order of the Taliban prime minister.
The 48-hour blackout disrupted businesses and flights, limited access to emergency services and raised fears about further isolating women and girls whose rights have been severely eroded since the hardline Islamist group swept back to power in 2021.


On Wednesday evening hundreds of Afghans took the streets in the capital city Kabul to spread the word that the internet was back. 
One man told BBC Afghan: "Everyone is happy, holding their cell phones and talking to their relatives.
"From women, to men and Talibs [a member of the Taliban], each was talking on phones after services were restored. There are more crowds now in the city."
Suhail Shaheen, a senior Taliban spokesman in Qatar, said "all communications" were restored by Wednesday afternoon.
The Taliban government has not given an official explanation for the shutdown.

However, last month, a spokesperson for the Taliban governor in the northern province of Balkh said internet access was being blocked "for the prevention of vices".  
Since returning to power, the Taliban have imposed numerous restrictions in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.
Afghan women have told the BBC that the internet was a lifeline to the outside world since the Taliban banned girls over the age of 12 from receiving an education. 
Women's job options have also been severely restricted and in September, books written by women were removed from universities.
Following the internet shutdown on Monday, the UN said it left Afghanistan almost completely cut off from the outside world. 
It added that the blackout risked "inflicting significant harm on the Afghan people, including by threatening economic stability and exacerbating one of the world's worst humanitarian crises".
During the blackout, the BBC was told that the centre of Kabul was noticeably quieter, with banks closed and shopping centres near empty.
In the money exchange market, all international transfers had been stopped - meaning vital money, often from family members abroad, could not enter Afghanistan.
Afghans living outside the country phoned in to a BBC Afghan radio show in the hopes their messages reached family members still there.
Travel agents were either closed or only partially open to provide customers with information. Flights in and out of the country were cancelled.
"This is the gradual death," one shopkeeper told us. "When there is no hope, no chances of progress, no freedom of speech, no optimism for the future of your child, no stability for your business, where you can't benefit from your studies."
But on Wednesday, the mood lifted when people could use the internet and call each other again. 
Delivery driver Sohrab Ahmadi said: "It's like Eid al-Adha; it's like preparing to go for prayer. 
"We are very happy from the bottom of our hearts."
Mah, a 24-year-old who fled Afghanistan in 2021 and is now getting an education in the UK, said she was in tears when she could finally speak to her family, who remain there.  
"When I spoke to my mum, I cried, I was happy," she said. "At least I can hear her voice."
She added: "You don't know what's going to happen next in Afghanistan because nothing's under control."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[A chronicler of the 20th century, from her surrealist experiments with Man Ray to gripping photos from World War II, Lee Miller put her unique stamp on all of her work, as shown at the Tate Britain.

From her pioneering work in French surrealism to war photography, Lee Miller (1907-1977) is currently celebrated in an exhibition at the Tate Britain museum. The largest retrospective of the trailblazing photographer ever held in the UK, "Lee Miller" runs from October 2 to February 15, 2026.

The accidental model
Born in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1907, Elizabeth "Lee" Miller showed an early interest in the arts and Europe, moving to Paris at age 18 to study lighting, costume and design at a theater school. A year later, she returned to the US, moving to New York City, where she studied theater, drawing and painting.
Soon after, she became one of the most sought-after models in New York, purely by accident, when Conde Montrose Nast, the publisher of Vogue magazine, saved her from getting run over by a car. But Miller quickly tired of modeling, and was far more interested in taking photographs herself.

Surrealism's golden couple
In 1929, Miller returned to Paris, where she became the student, muse, lover and collaborator of the artist and photographer Man Ray. Together, they made the technique of solarization one of their aesthetic trademarks. Miller set up her own photographic studio and established herself as an artist.


Making art in the desert
After leaving Man Ray, Miller married in 1934 her first husband, Egyptian businessman Aziz Eloui Bey, and moved with him to Cairo. There, she applied her surrealism-trained eye to photographing the natural landscape of Egypt, resulting in some of her best-known artworks like this photo, "Portrait of Space."

War photography through a surrealist's eye
In 1937, Miller returned to Paris, where she met her second husband, the British surrealist painter Roland Penrose, with whom she later had a son. The couple settled in London, and with the outbreak of the Second World War, Miller decided to put her photographic skills to use as a war correspondent for Vogue magazine.

She traveled through England and Europe and was at the frontlines, the only woman photographer granted permission to travel independently in the war zones.
The photos she took during this period merged photojournalism with art, as her surrealist sensibilities informed the framing of her shots.

The woman in Hitler's bathtub
Miller was also praised for picking out small moments that a man might have missed. One of her most famous photos shows her bathing in Hitler's bathtub in Munich on the same day the Nazi dictator committed suicide in Berlin. She was billeted in Hitler's Munich apartment after documenting the liberated Dachau concentration camp.
Miller was motivated by empathy more than a desire to aestheticize, and her photos of the death and destruction und human suffering she witnessed retain their shocking power more than seven decades later.

Pals with Picasso
Lee Miller shared close friendships with several of her fellow artists, including Pablo Picasso. She took nearly 1,000 photos of him during the four decades they knew each other, and he painted her six times.
Miller's son, Antony Penrose, has written a children's book about his childhood experiences with the artist, titled "The Boy Who Bit Picasso." This photograph by Miller of the two was taken at Picasso's studio in Paris shortly after the liberation of the city by Allied forces.

A farewell to photojournalism
Miller remained deeply affected by what she saw and documented during the war, and suffered from depression and alcoholism after returning to England. She eventually gave up photography, turning her creativity to cooking gourmet meals for her friends and family.
Lee Miller died of cancer at the age of 70 in 1977.
Her trailblazing influence and legacy, both as an artist and a war reporter, have earned her an important place in the history of 20th-century photography.

 A nationwide general strike in Greece halted trains, ferries and taxis on Wednesday, stranding a number of workers and other people in the country.
The one-day general strike was called in response to proposed changes to labor standards —  including a government plan to allow employers to extend working hours.
No taxis in Athens nor trains will run for the duration of the 24-hour strike. Buses and the city's subway, tram and trolley service are operating on a severely reduced schedule.
Thousands of people, including teachers and seafarers, marched to parliament in Athens after the strike was organized by Greece's largest private and public trade unions.

What are the new labor laws Athens wants to introduce?
The government bill would allow employers to seek up to 13 hours of work a day from their staff, compared with the current eight. 
Under the new regulations, working hours that include overtime would be capped at 48 hours per week, with a maximum of 150 hours of overtime allowed per year.
Additionally, the draft law would also give employers more flexibility on short-term hirings, while amending rules on annual leave in the private sector. The law is expected to be submitted to parliament for its approval this month.
Unions argue the new rules leave workers vulnerable to labor abuses by employers.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The bulky brown bear from Alaska won the online competition by more than 30,000 votes despite a broken jaw impeding his pre-hibernation gorging. Voters also apparently forgave and forgot last year's infanticide.
    Chunk did not let a broken jaw hinder his hunt for Alaskan salmon and other snacks that earned the three-time finalist a gold medal at last in 2025's 'Fat Bear Week' Image: T. Carmack/Katmai-Nationalpark/dpa/picture alliance   
An Alaskan brown bear nicknamed Chunk has won the Fat Bear Week 2025 online voting competition, improving on his previous personal best as a three-time defeated finalist in past years. 


The body positive competition showcases brown bears in the Katmai National Park at their corpulent best, following a summer of gorging to prepare themselves for their winter hibernation each year. 
Half-ton omnivore with broken jaw
Formally bear 32, "Chunk" faced bear 856 — as yet without a soubriquet of his own — at the end of a one-week head-to-head knockout competition, claiming 96,350 online votes to 63,725 for his competitor.

Voters and viewers online could survey images and video footage of the competitors, including from a series of cameras placed in the Brooks River trying to catch the bears feasting and fighting for the best spots to fish salmon returning to their birthplace to lay their eggs. 
Shots of the winner were characterized by his misshapen muzzle, the result of a broken jaw that did little to slow his consumption.
Chunk's weight was estimated at roughly 545 kilograms or 1,200 pounds, albeit without a precise pre-fight weigh-in, with Mike Fitz, a naturalist at explore.org saying that, "Despite his broken jaw, he remains one of the biggest, baddest bears at Brooks River."


Results were rushed out overnight to ensure the big bear reveal was not jeopardized by the US government shutdown.
The 'Grazer' rivalry: First Chunk killed her cub, now he's claimed her crown
Bear 856 may well have done Chunk a favor in the semifinals, by defeating two-time defending champion bear 128, "Grazer," and by eliminating a bear with whom Chunk has a longstanding and presumably bitter rivalry.

The female defeated Chunk in the 2023 final, and then again in 2024, with the public vote surely partly swayed that second time by Chunk being caught on camera in one of the park's video feeds killing one of Grazer's cubs after it fell down a waterfall and into his path. 
Another member of Grazer's litter, listed on the competition billing simply as "128's yearling," won this year's "Fat Bear Jr" competition and even survived the first round of the senior event. The youngster was eliminated in the quarterfinals by another bear, 602, which Chunk dispatched in the semis.

 Nord Stream blast suspect to remain in custody pending extradition case
    
A Ukrainian man arrested in Poland on Tuesday in connection with the 2022 undersea attack on the Nord Stream pipelines will remain in custody while a decision is made whether to transfer him to Germany.
The suspect, identified as Volodymyr Z., is said to be a diving instructor based in Poland who was part of a six-member group that hired a yacht in the German port city of Rostock.
The vessel was then alleged to have sailed to a point in the Baltic Sea above the pipelines.
German prosecutors say explosives were placed on the gas pipes and detonated, damaging three of the four conduits in the Nord Stream project.
"He is detained for seven days, and it is difficult to agree with this decision," the suspect's lawyer, Tymoteusz Paprocki, told reporters.
"I do not accept this decision, and we will certainly appeal," he said.

 Russia-linked tanker sailed close to Danish coast in September
    
According to a maritime website, a tanker from Russia's so-called "shadow fleet," which is suspected of being involved in the numerous drone flight sightings across Denmark sailed off the European country's coast recently.
Analysis from VesselFinder, carried out by AFP, showed the tanker sailed off the Danish coast between September 22-25.

 'Nothing is ruled out' if Russian jet enters European airspace — Macron
    
French President Emmanuel Macron said shooting down a Russian warplane if it entered European airspace was not out of the realm of possibility.
In an interview with German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on the question of whether he was in favor of shooting down a Russian jet that breaches European airspace, Macron said, "In accordance with the doctrine of strategic ambiguity, I can tell you that nothing is ruled out."
Earlier in the interview, Macron said, "Russia is the greatest structural threat to Europeans."
Russia has been blamed for drone incursions into NATO members Poland and Romania and Macron last week said the military alliance's response would have to "go up a notch" in the case of "new provocations" from Moscow.
Later during talks in Copenhagen, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc was being tested by Moscow.
"We see that Russia is testing our resolve. These are times where it is absolutely paramount that we have this common sense of urgency and unity to address these challenges," von der Leyen said.
There was broad support for a "drone wall" to help improve air defense in the face of Russian incursions.
"We have to improve our equipment collectively and cooperate to have early warning systems, much more anti-drone systems, and much more capacities as well to deter our enemies," Macron said at the talks.

 Ukraine invasion 'a Russian attempt to threaten all of us' — Danish PM
    
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has said the war in Ukraine, coupled with what she called a "hybrid" war on Europe, makes the current situation the most perilous since World War II.
"I think we are in the most difficult and dangerous situation since the end of the Second World War, not the Cold War anymore," Frederiksen said, arriving at an EU summit in Copenhagen.
"If you look at Russia and (its) hybrid war from a European perspective instead of from your own national perspective, then I think everybody has to be on the same page that we have to rearm all of us," she said.
She described Moscow's invasion of Ukraine as not simply a conflict in a European country, "but as a Russian attempt to threaten all of us."
Frederiksen said the variety of methods used in hybrid warfare made it difficult for countries to defend themselves.
 "Hybrid war is about threatening us and committing all different kinds of crimes and activities all the time," she added.
Her remarks come after a series of drone sightings in several European countries, including Denmark, with authorities suspecting Russian involvement in most cases, as well as incursions by Russian fighter jets into Estonian airspace.

Floods caused by heavy rain have killed at least nine people, including a child, in Ukraine's southern port city of Odesa, which has also been a frequent target of Russian attacks during Moscow's ongoing invasion.
Announcing the deaths on X, formerly Twitter, President Volodymr Zelenskyy described the situation as "horrific."

Authorities said nearly two months' worth of rain fell in just seven hours.
Altogether 362 people were rescued from the surging waters, emergency workers said.
The bad weather is set to continue on Thursday, meteorologists said.

 Russia-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant no imminent threat despite outage — IAEA
    
The Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine does not pose an immediate risk, despite it having been without power for more than a week, as long as its generators keep working, the UN nuclear watchdog IAEA said late Tuesday.
"While the plant is currently coping thanks to its emergency diesel generators — the last line of defense — and there is no immediate danger as long as they keep working, it is clearly not a sustainable situation in terms of nuclear safety," IAEA head Rafael Grossi said in a statement.
In the statement, the IAEA said the plant's management had told it that the site still had fuel reserves for more than 10 days of operation with the backup of supplies from outside.
The plant, Europe's largest, lost power on September 23, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr on Tuesday calling the situation there "critical" amid what is the longest of the 10 outages from the grid it has had since being seized by Russian forces.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that "the Russian side is ensuring safety at the station," while blaming Ukraine for shelling the site.
Kyiv accuses Russian forces of doing the same thing, which Peskov dismissed as ridiculous in view of the fact that Russia controls the plant.
Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, the facility, which is situated near the frontl line, has seen several safety threats, including frequent nearby shelling, repeated power cuts and staff shortages.

 EU leaders talk drones, Ukraine funding
    
EU leaders are gathering in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, for talks on boosting Europe's defenses and Ukraine's financial stability.
The agenda will include discussions on establishing a "drone wall" as a defense against the threat posed by Russia, which is suspected to be behind recent drone flights in Denmark that followed air incursions by Moscow in Poland and Estonia.
Brussels has also suggested that the bloc unite behind defense projects that include securing its eastern flank, establishing better missile defenses and a space "shield" as part of efforts to get ready for a potential conflict with Russia by 2030.

Leaders will also examine a proposal from Brussels to use frozen Russian central bank assets to back a new €140 billion ($164 billion) loan for Kyiv to assist it in its fight against the ongoing Russian invasion.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz last week spoke out in favor of the plan after Berlin initially displayed reluctance to use the funds, citing legal and financial concerns.
The summit is taking place after unidentified drones were sighted around airports and military sites in the Denmark, raising fears that Russia might be escalating its attempts to undermine security in Europe.
The meeting is being convened amid tight security, with thousands of police on high alert and a ban on civilian drones in place.
Neighboring countries as well as allies from the US to Ukraine have sent anti-drone technology to Denmark ahead of the talks to bolster the country's defense capabilities.
Denmark currently holds the EU's rotating presidency.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[A new study reveals that the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel significantly impacted the everyday lives of Jews and Israelis in Germany. The authors of the report are urging more protection against discrimination.

"You can't walk through our neighborhood without coming across antisemitic graffiti," says one Jewish woman living in Berlin, who wishes to remain anonymous.
For her, antisemitism has become part of everyday life since October 7, 2023, when Hamas, a Palestinian militant group based in Gaza, led an incursion into southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostages.
"I realize that I ask myself: where do we go from here?"
Her account is one of many found in a new study on the impact of the October 7 Hamas attacks in Israel on Jewish and Israeli communities in Germany. Respondents describe everyday life and resulting psychological problems, such as depression, insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks. It paints a grim picture of Jewish life in Germany two years after the October 7 attacks.
Israel responded to the 2023 attacks by declaring war on Hamas, which Germany, the US, the EU and other states designated a terrorist organization, in Gaza. The war has killed more than 66,000 Palestinians and injured many more, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.


Feeling isolated and fearful
The study reveals that respondents deal with exclusion, threats and fears in everyday life. Interviewees describe how they experience taking local public transport, going about their work, attending school and university or visiting doctors, with one medical professional even bringing up the war in Gaza. Many of these cases left Jews feeling socially isolated.

The survey found that Jews and Israelis feel a lack of empathy pervading many areas of German life. Non-Jewish relatives, long-standing friends and neighbors showed little empathy for the suffering of Jews, the report showed. It said this was also the case in dating and relationships.
State security and civil society institutions have long been recording the number of antisemitic incidents in Germany since October 7, 2023. Their records show a major rise in antisemitic incidents since October 7 and reveal that they remain at a high level. These reports also point out that ever more Jewish institutions are now under police protection.
The newly published study examined the consequences of these antisemitic incidents. It found that in many cases, respondents felt compelled to hide their Jewish identity or isolate themselves.

The study was authored by Berlin psychologist Marina Chernivsky, who heads the Competence Center for Education and Research Critical of Antisemitism, and Friederike Lorenz-Sinai, a professor of social work research at the Potsdam University of Applied Sciences.
Soon after the 2023 Hamas-led attacks, Chernivsky and Lorenz-Sinai set out to find individuals willing to talk about their lives, expecting to find perhaps 30 different people. They posted ads in several languages (German, English, Russian, Hebrew) across various German cities and on social media.
To their surprise, 111 women and men joined the researchers' interviews and group discussions. Chernivsky and Lorenz-Sinai found that the study participants experienced the October 7 attack as "powerfully overwhelming," deeming it a historical turning point. They observed that Jews in Germany perceived others as "relativizing, legitimizing and glorifying the genocidal violence of October 7."

The study shows "how strongly antisemitism affects the everyday lives of Jews," Germany's Independent Federal Anti-Discrimination Commissioner Ferda Ataman said when the survey was presented in Berlin. Jews are "insulted, threatened, discriminated against and on constant alert," Ataman added. Her anti-discrimination agency helped finance the study.
Stronger anti-discrimination law needed
Ataman said that Jews must feel "that the rule of law is there to protect them". That is why she called for swift criminal prosecutions and better protection against discrimination in everyday life. Ataman specifically highlighted the need for a "better anti-discrimination law that is effective against antisemitism." The current law, in force since 2006, for example, provides Israeli citizens in Germany only with limited protection against discrimination, she said.
In the study, several participants reported being ostracized or confronted with a "one-sided demonization of Israel" in the aftermath of the October 7 attacks. Yet some also reported positive experiences. One Jewish woman, for example, said that on the very first day after the massacre, her Muslim colleagues sent her messages of solidarity and support. That said, there are not many passages detailing such positive experiences in the 110-page study.
Josef Schuster, President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said the study's findings were dramatic but unsurprising  Image: dts-Agentur/picture alliance 

The President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster, said the study painted a "depressing picture", though one that "does not surprise Jews at all." He said it documented "everyday" cases of antisemitism which had undergone a "dramatic escalation."
Schuster said Jews were increasingly excluded from full participation in society and felt compelled to "hide their own identity" for their own protection.
Chernivsky and Lorenz-Sinai, meanwhile, want to continue their work on the survey. The final report, which is slated for publication in 2026, will focus on the experiences and concerns of children and young people and the future prospects of Jewish and Israeli communities in Germany.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for at least 95% of the 660,000 cervical cancer diagnoses globally. But US research shows the tremendous impact of ongoing vaccine programs.
    A growing number of HPV vaccinations even keeps women who didn't get the shot safe Image: John J. Kim/Zumapress/picture alliance   
A vaccine administered to adolescent girls and boys has been so successful that herd immunity against a virus that causes cervical cancer is within reach, at least in the United States.
However, sustaining community resistance to the human papillomavirus (HPV) will depend on whether the US can maintain high vaccination rates.
HPV is the world's most common sexually transmitted infection . Vaccines against certain strains of HPV, of which there are hundreds, have existed for almost two decades.
Currently a "nine-valent" vaccine — protecting against nine strains of HPV that together account for 90% of cervical cancers — is licensed in the US. Other nations use vaccines tailored to two or four variants.
Research published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics has found that the extensive HPV vaccination program in the US has driven major reductions in cervical cancer diagnoses, including among unvaccinated women.
"Our study demonstrates evidence for herd immunity against cervical cancer-causing HPV in one community and in the setting of high vaccination rates and a gender-neutral vaccination strategy, that is, vaccination of both boys and girls," said the study's senior author, pediatrician Jessica Kahn from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. 
Kahn's community refers to a specific group of women at higher risk of HPV infection, with almost 80% having had two or more male sexual partners and more than half having been diagnosed with an STI. 
The analysis of nearly 20 years of data from the group found that HPV infections covered by vaccines declined substantially. In the case of bivalent vaccines, which target two strains, there was a 98% decrease in infection.  
Because the sexual behaviors of the study group showed little change, it means HPV vaccines are probably responsible for curbing infection rates, including among unvaccinated women. Even though they have no immune protection, this group saw a 75% decline in infection by strains covered by the bivalent vaccine.
Such a phenomenon suggests herd immunity against the disease in the US is within reach, though Kahn cautioned it would never be possible to know for sure. 
"There is not a specific fixed point at which we can say that HPV is eliminated," said Kahn. "Herd protection is dynamic and can wane if vaccine uptake decreases, individuals become more susceptible to HPV or transmission dynamics change."


HPV: Often benign, potentially deadly
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women, with most deaths occurring in lower and middle-income countries.
HPV viruses were first discovered as a cause of cervical cancer by German scientist Harald zur Hausen in 1983. His discovery led to him being a joint recipient of the 2008 Nobel Prize for Medicine.
Most sexually active people are infected with HPV viruses at some point in their lives, but usually experience no symptoms. These viruses can cause wart growths on the skin of humans — often benign — and usually on the skin, feet and hands, throat and genitals.
Sometimes, certain HPV viruses become incorporated into healthy cells, disrupting their normal cell processes. In cells lining the cervix, this can lead to the development of cancers.
Cervical cancer rates have declined since the introduction of a vaccine called Gardasil, developed by Australia-based researchers in the 1990s and released in the 2000s. It was the first in a family of inoculations that can prevent HPV infections. 
Current HPV vaccines are usually administered to girls aged 9-14. Boys in this age group may also receive the vaccine, as is the case in the US, to provide more extensive community protection.

Global rollout continues amid challenges
The World Health Organization (WHO) wants to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem. 
Its strategy would see 90% of girls vaccinated by age 15 globally, at least 70% of women undergo cervical cancer screenings by 35 and again at 45, and 90% of women diagnosed with the cancer receiving treatment.
WHO modelling suggests meeting these targets could prevent 74 million new cases of cervical cancer, including 300,000 by the end of this decade.
Long-running vaccination programs have successfully curbed cervical cancer rates. One study of more than 1.6 million Swedish girls and women found nearly half as many cases of cervical cancer among those who were vaccinated as those who had never received a jab. 
That study's lead author Jiayao Lei, an epidemiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, said the US study's findings were unsurprising, given what her research had found.
"It's a really good evidence because it demonstrates the indirect protection from the vaccination particularly for those non-vaccinated [women]," Lei said. 
Lei said receiving the vaccine during adolescence also provided better protection against HPV infection, even with only one dose of vaccine. 

"Those who were vaccinated at the earlier age will have a stronger protection," Lei told DW. "There's a comparable effectiveness achieved for those who vaccinate earlier [with any dosage], while for those who vaccinate after age 20, it seemed to be having a higher dose might offer better protection."
That is particularly important for countries just beginning to roll out the vaccine to adolescent groups. Pakistan recently began its HPV program for girls aged 9-14 while Ghana will start delivering vaccines to this age group in October. 
Still, there are challenges.
Pakistan is contending with local misinformation campaigns, particularly against false claims that the vaccine causes infertility. Despite this, nine million girls have now been vaccinated, according to Pakistan's health ministry. It is hoping to vaccinate around 13 million girls.
The rise of vaccine skepticism and declining vaccine acceptance globally poses a unique challenge to controlling and, potentially, eradicating diseases like HPV-caused cervical cancer. Disruption to vaccine programs and health system crises, disparity in access to vaccines, and hesitancy borne by misinformation and disinformation campaigns pose a major barrier to curbing cervical cancer.
"The vaccine is extremely effective, but only if it gets into arms," Kahn said.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The women's football transfer record was broken four times in two months this year and has risen almost 600% since 2019. It reflects a growing commercial relevance but poses issues for some, including the Bundesliga.
    Grace Geyoro became the most expensive player in the history of women's football when she moved to London City Lionesses in September Image: Steven Paston/empics/picture alliance   
When the league stage of the UEFA Women's Champions League begins on October 7, it will do so without the game's most expensive player. France midfielder, Grace Geyoro, signed for newly-promoted London City Lionesses (owned by wealthy businesswoman and serial football investor, Michelle Kang) in September for a fee of about €1.6 million ($1.9 million).
Geyoro's move was the fifth to break the world transfer record in 2025, with each player moving to either the NWSL in the USA or the WSL in England.
"It is a very good sign," women's football agent Jasmina Covic told DW.
"The record is being broken every couple of months. It's good for the ecosystem. If I look back 10 years, there were just a few transfers with any fees, now you see it all the time."

Short-term contracts and a lack of investment in women's football meant that transfer fees for players were very rare until recently and, in comparison to men's football, very small. Until Pernille Harder's €280,000 move from Wolfsburg to Chelsea in 2019, €235,000 was the top fee paid for a female player. That record had stood since 2002.
Rising transfer fees may leave some behind
The success of recent women's international tournaments and increasingly common sellouts at significant stadiums around the world have increased the sports' visibility and, accordingly, marketability.
A report by Nielsen Sports in collaboration with PepsiCo released earlier this year claimed it is set to become one of the world's top five sports by 2030 and watched by more than 800 million people. With more money flowing in to the best players and the biggest clubs, transfer fees and wages at the top end have increased accordingly. While larger commercial deals, longer more lucrative contracts, higher ticket receipts and broadcast deals all look good for the elite, there are dangers associated with the rapid growth.

"As you start bringing in these huge transfer fees, you're eliminating so many of the clubs from these different leagues around the world who can't afford these players, and then you're just making that gap a lot bigger," Shona Young, of global sports marketing agency SPORTFIVE, told DW.
That gap between the haves and have nots is already a concern for many in women's football, just as in men's. No club from outside England, France, Germany or Spain have won the Women's Champions League in Europe while domestic titles are often won by the same team over and over again. Though leagues in Mexico, Brazil and other parts of the world are also growing rapidly, there's little doubt that the leagues in England and the US are where the top players want to be.


German Bundesliga has revenue problem
All of which poses a problem for the Bundesliga in Germany, as Covic notes.
"The German market is still very interesting, it's a very competitive league and more investments are being made. But obviously, you can't compare it to England and the US, where there's much more money. But I think we're getting there slowly."
No German side has won the Champions League since FFC Frankfurt (now part of Eintracht Frankfurt) in 2015, when the landscape was very different. The record fee for a player in the Bundesliga is German midfielder Lena Oberdorf's 2024 move from one of the leagues major powers, Wolfsburg, to the other, Bayern Munich. The cost was €450,000, much less than a third of Geyoro's price.

According to a report from SPORTFIVE, where Young works, Germany's top flight gets €5.2 million a year from broadcasting income and €5.5 million from its title sponsor. By comparison, the WSL makes €15 million in broadcasting and more than €17 million from its title sponsor. The NWSL make even more, €50 million for broadcasting and a reported €20 million from its sponsor. That, plus higher average attendances and richer owners (whether men's clubs or individuals), explains the gap in transfer budget.
Women's football fans follow players, not clubs
These are not the only metrics on which the Bundesliga is falling behind, with social media following of leagues, clubs and players also lagging by comparison. For Young, the interest in players and national teams are key to attracting new fans. The report surveyed 12,000 people with various levels of interest in the game. It found, as of January, that Germany's most popular player Giulia Gwinn, had 632,000 Instagram followers compared to 1.1 million for England captain Leah Williamson and 9.9 million for Alex Morgan of Team USA. Germany's national team had 468,000 followers, England 2.3 million and the US also 2.3 million.
"What we found in women's football is the fans want to follow the players before they follow a club. So they really latch on to these national team players and really support them, find out what club they're playing at and then gravitate to support that club," she said. "Whereas in the men's game, you've got hardcore, loyal fans that support the club and the club only, and don't tend to follow those players."
Moving for a high transfer fee is another way in which players can attract fans, and therefore finance, added Young. While spending on transfers and wages isn't the only way to success, it certainly helps. The growth of women's football has seen rapid change at the very top of the game over the last decade, but there is a real danger that other leagues, countries and clubs are in danger of being cut adrift from the elite.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Why were U.S. military officers fretting about having to show up, on short notice, to a base in Quantico, Virginia, to hear a speech from the two civilians in the chain of command? “All hands” meetings like the one held this week, at which subordinates gather to hear from top leadership, are one of the oldest customs in the U.S. military—think “George Washington addressing the troops.” What made this meeting so notable is that today’s military is buffeted by an atmosphere of extreme partisan polarization, and neither political party is doing much to protect the military from its baleful effects. In such a moment, the long-term health of the American republic depends on the military safely walking an extremely narrow tightrope to uphold civilian control without becoming a partisan institution itself.
High-profile meetings such as the one in Quantico force the military to walk that tightrope in the full glare of the media and without the safety net of strong trust across the civil-military divide. The military audience managed to pull off that feat, but they can be forgiven for fretting about it in advance. The last military audience in that situation—the lower-ranking troops who heard a similarly partisan speech from President Donald Trump at Fort Bragg in June—failed the test, whooping and hollering as if they were the party faithful at a political rally. In that case, many of the “applause lines” were scathing critiques of the lawful orders their military oath had required them to implement barely a year ago.
In the United States, the civil-military balance depends on commanders in chief of either party trusting the military to obey lawful orders regardless of which party is in power. The risk represented by the gathering orchestrated by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the speech delivered by Donald Trump is that it threatens to leave military leaders with no choice but to become partisan actors or to violate norms of civilian control of the military. So far, senior U.S. officers have managed that dilemma reasonably effectively. But the more that civilian leaders treat the military as a partisan institution, the more the military will start behaving like a partisan institution—and the less it can be relied on to fight and win wars.
WHAT YOU DON’T KNOW
George Washington and the other great military heroes in American history excelled at delivering informative and inspiring remarks to the assembled troops. Civilian leaders have done this, too, although rarely quite so memorably. There have been many thousands of tedious all-hands meetings for every significant one, so the convening of one usually prompts more eye rolls than alarms.
Why, then, was there such a big fuss that Hegseth called in hundreds of senior military leaders (and the media) for an all-hands? Partly it was because this particular type of all-hands was unprecedented, especially when Trump joined and turned it into a presidential level gig. All-hands are typically held at lower levels or when the secretary of defense visits an installation, but it is unusual to hold one on a global scale. There is little precedent or rationale for bringing senior leaders together in person when virtual alternatives are available. Pulling off an unplanned meeting of this kind was a staffing nightmare. Moving one senior military officer around the world involves a lot of staff work. Moving hundreds boggles the mind. In the military, this is known as a “whiskey tango foxtrot moment,” and it left thousands of lower-level personnel asking, “What is the emergency that is prompting this event-planning crisis?”


But the more ominous reason the gathering kicked up such a fuss is that the Department of Defense increasingly operates in a low-information environment. Since Trump began his second term, leaders have been taking significant actions—consider the unprecedented pace of firing senior officers or the sharp escalation of military strikes in the Western Hemisphere—without providing much explanation to affected individuals, the junior ranks, or the general public. All sorts of worst-case theories flood into the vacuum of a low-information environment.
One such theory that proved wildly off was that Hegseth intended to use this as a moment to institute a new loyalty oath. A retired general raised that possibility on social media, and rather than knocking it back, Hegseth coyly seemed to suggest that there might be something to this notion. Hegseth may have just been trolling the alarmists, because instituting a new oath would have provoked a genuine crisis in civil-military relations and threatened public confidence in both the military and American democracy. The existing military oath, which has served the country well since the days of George Washington (with an important change after the Civil War), obligates the military to support and defend the Constitution, and the Constitution establishes the president as commander in chief. In practice, members of the military honor the oath when they obey the lawful orders of the commander in chief. (By contrast, the Constitution obligates the other branches of government, the legislature and the judiciary, to determine what is lawful and to serve as a check against lawful but awful orders.) Because the people in the audience at Quantico have been honoring this oath, the Trump administration has faced no resistance from the military even as the administration has made abrupt and dramatic changes. Any change to the oath in this polarized and partisan moment would have marked a true crisis.
Instead, what happened was what was most likely to happen from the get-go: a mother of all all-hands, at which military leaders heard, not for the first time, Trump and Hegseth’s vision and were challenged to redouble their efforts to implement it. Convening such a meeting is within the prerogatives of civilian control, and civilians have the right to deem whether it is worth the effort to convene it.
A FINE BALANCE
Yet avoiding the worst-case scenario did not mean that there was nothing to worry about. On the contrary, because of the country’s partisan, polarized environment, the meeting was an unusually fraught episode in American civil-military relations. When political leaders such as the president or secretary of defense give remarks to the troops, the speechwriters always include lines designed to generate applause. Praising the heroics of this or that unit, invoking sports rivalries, or including self-deprecating humor designed to show that the senior leaders understand what those serving under them are going through are all effective rhetorical devices that can help leaders build trust with their subordinates.
But strident partisan statements cut the other way, especially with an audience of senior military officers. Those officers understand that professional ethics require that they avoid even giving the appearance of partisanship—which means refraining from applauding the partisan statements of others, since cheering the policies of one party is tantamount to booing the policies of the other. Over the course of their professional lives, these military officers are likely to serve a large chunk of their time under both parties. If they become identified as partisans of one, they may be viewed as enemies of the other—starting a cycle of partisan purges that leaves the military disoriented, demoralized, and ineffective, as has happened in other purge-prone militaries. A rip-roaring partisan stem-winder that works on the campaign trail should fall flat with a military audience if that audience is honoring its professional duty.
Hegseth’s speech had a lot of boilerplate of the sort that would show up in any speech. But it had at least as much partisan red meat suited to a MAGA audience and very little to say about the exceptionally complex geopolitical environment the U.S. military is confronting. Trump’s speech, meanwhile, included the standard humorous asides, generating some natural laughter from the audience. But other than that, the military representatives resisted Trump’s encouragement to “loosen up” and stayed professional, barely reacting to the partisan commentary—including when Trump went on at some length about the “enemy within,” apparently referring to political opponents rather than genuine adversaries trying to hurt the United States. If there is a movement to translate some of the rhetorical bombast into actual policies, that will be the moment when key military advisers may need to speak up, very quietly, within the chain of command to warn civilian leaders about the second- and third-order effects of such policies. But a made-for-TV speech is not the time for that, so the military audience rightly kept quiet.
In short, U.S. military leaders met the moment. They knew that the world was watching, particularly their own troops, and were especially keen to show proper decorum reflecting a professional military ethic. Accordingly, they stood and applauded for the ceremonial arrival and departure of the civilians in their chain of command. Otherwise, they listened respectfully, taking pains not to resemble a campaign rally audience, lest they compromise the nonpartisan ethos of the military.


Ultimately, Hegseth’s all-hands turned out to be both an opportunity and a challenge. The mystery preceding it guaranteed that media attention exceeded that for almost anything else the secretary has presided over. There was a risk the event could have turned the military into a political prop, and all the partisan commentary from the stage provided ample opportunity for that. Fortunately, the military itself averted that outcome—preserving, at least for now, the trust and balance on which healthy civil-military relations depend.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[In Washington today, a familiar anxiety hangs in the air. American policymakers fear that China will leapfrog the United States in the technologies that matter most, including robotics and artificial intelligence. The United States has been here before, in the 1980s. Then, the specter wasn’t Beijing but Tokyo. Best-selling books such as Japan as Number One warned of Japanese dominance. The PBS series Frontline aired the documentary “Losing the War to Japan.” Silicon Valley looked spent after U.S. producers exited the market for memory chips such as DRAM. Detroit, humbled by the Japanese carmaker Toyota’s lean production, seemed a cautionary tale. Japan’s grip on automobiles and consumer electronics appeared unshakable.
But by 1995, when the information technology boom finally showed up in productivity statistics, the United States had pulled decisively ahead. Forecasts of relative American decline were wrong not because Japan stumbled but because the United States excelled when it mattered at the opening of the computer age. The United States didn’t beat Japan by building tariff walls or propping up national champions. U.S. leadership rested on open competition and the flexibility to rewire supply chains globally as technology shifted—in a word, dynamism.
Today, the Trump administration seems to have forgotten that lesson. Since returning to the presidency, Donald Trump has urged Intel’s chief to resign, demanded a 15 percent remittance to Washington on certain Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices chip sales to China, and carved out a government “golden share” in U.S. Steel as part of the Japanese company Nippon Steel’s takeover. Such arbitrary, deal-by-deal interventions break with the rules-based approach that kept the United States ahead of Japan.
How the United States outcompeted Japan is more than history: it’s a guide to the China challenge. Tokyo’s economic model looked unbeatable for a time, as Beijing’s does now. But the tools that make U.S. markets more innovative and, in the end, more competitive haven’t changed—and Washington should not discard policies that have worked.
ADAPT OR PERISH
Japan’s postwar “miracle”—real GDP per capita growth averaging roughly eight percent a year from 1950 until the 1973 oil shock—has deep roots. In the Meiji era (1868–1912), Japanese leaders built a state adept at absorbing Western know-how—drawing especially on the United Kingdom—by creating a national translation bureau, importing thousands of foreign instructors, and standardizing a technical vocabulary. A highly centralized state rolled out rail and telegraph networks, guaranteed returns to investors, and spun off pilot enterprises to family-run conglomerates, or zaibatsu, that coordinated closely with the bureaucracy.


After World War II, Tokyo extended the nineteenth-century formula: a tight state-business partnership importing, adapting, and scaling frontier technologies at speed. The 1951 San Francisco Treaty, which restored friendly relations between Japan and the Allied powers, brought access to U.S. technology and technical assistance. But the Ministry of International Trade and Industry—Japan’s powerful economic bureaucracy overseeing industrial policy, trade, and technology strategy—also played a significant role in channeling foreign knowledge that firms quickly absorbed and improved. By conditioning market access on compulsory patent licensing, most notably in negotiations with the U.S. technology companies IBM and Texas Instruments, MITI ensured that cutting-edge innovations flowed to corporate Japan. In IBM’s case, Shigeru Sahashi, then the head of MITI’s Enterprises Bureau, threatened to block the company’s business in Japan unless it licensed its technologies to local firms at a royalty capped at five percent. IBM agreed.
Meanwhile, Japanese manufacturing emphasized kaizen (continuous improvement), lean production, and just-in-time delivery. Corporate restructuring helped advance those principles as interconnected groups of companies, or keiretsu, replaced the zaibatsu. By the mid-1960s, six of these groups controlled about 30 percent of corporate Japan, coordinating on complex manufacturing and raising barriers to outsiders.
By 1980, this model had produced remarkable results. Japanese autoworkers were about 17 percent more productive than their U.S. counterparts, and the American car companies Ford and General Motors posted losses exceeding $1.3 billion. In the Japanese semiconductor industry, chipmakers worked closely with equipment suppliers to wring defects out of production. By 1989, Japan had become an exporter to the world, supplying a quarter of all U.S. imports and satisfying about half of all global demand. Meanwhile, the United States saw its share of the global market fall from 57 to 40 percent in a little over a decade.
Yet the very institutions that delivered that edge to Japan also held back radical change. The country excelled at absorbing and refining others’ inventions—color television, the Walkman, the videocassette recorder—and channeled a large share of R & D into process efficiency. That made sense for the age of mature hardware, but it left Japan ill positioned for the shift to software and e-commerce. The reason lies in industrial organization. The keiretsu made internal cooperation easy and outside entry hard. Cartel-like coordination was tolerated, and antitrust enforcement was weak. Compared with the United States’ tradition of competition, Japan’s system favored incumbents. By 1989, Japanese courts had initiated only six criminal prosecutions in the 42-year history of the country’s Antimonopoly Law, which was introduced by the U.S.-led Allied occupation authorities. Over the same period, the U.S. government filed 2,271 antitrust cases—interventions that boosted employment and business formation. U.S. antitrust laws discouraged scale and tight coordination—areas in which Japan excelled—but they kept markets competitive and encouraged entry. On that basis, the United States eventually pulled ahead.
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
Just as the institutional foundations of Japan’s postwar leap reach back to the nineteenth century, so, too, do the roots of American dynamism. The late-nineteenth-century rise of corporate giants and nationwide trusts stoked fears that concentrated power was choking competition and innovation. In response, Congress enacted the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, which outlawed monopolization and restraints on trade. A quarter century later, in 1914, Congress passed the Clayton Antitrust Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, which tightened rules on anticompetitive mergers and exclusive dealing and created the FTC to police unfair competition.
The effects of these laws on technological development were lasting and concrete. Under pressure from the federal government, firms such as the chemical producer DuPont abandoned acquisition-led growth and expanded in-house R & D. Antitrust legislation also opened bottlenecks in computing. IBM used its market dominance to bundle software with hardware, raising barriers to outsiders. But in 1968, under antitrust pressure, it spun off its software business, creating a new market with space for startups, including Microsoft. Similarly, a decadelong antitrust case broke up AT&T in 1984, removing a single corporate chokepoint in telecommunications just as the Internet was emerging. A competitive, fragmented carrier market enabled a burst of experimentation—email, file transfer, collaborative tools—driven by users and new companies.
Decentralized markets did the rest. As big firms spun out and outsourced functions they once did in-house, they created room for new suppliers and product startups to enter. Crucially, those startups could scale through public markets rather than by selling themselves to incumbents. By the early years of this century, companies backed by venture capital made up roughly a third of total market capitalization. This wave—including Amazon, Apple, Cisco, Dell, Google, Microsoft, Netscape, and Nvidia—powered the computer revolution. The United States’ productivity revived, and Japan’s stalled out.


Rather than try to replicate Japan’s scale at home, U.S. firms had modularized production, adopted open standards, specialized in design, and tapped global value chains to cut costs and boost flexibility. By the mid-1990s, China’s assembly hubs had become extensions of American innovation, and Taiwan hosted thousands of nimble component makers. U.S. firms’ deep integration with the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan eroded Japan’s cost advantage and sped the United States’ pivot to software, services, and platforms.
FORTRESS ECONOMICS
The key to China’s economic rise is different from that of both Japan and the United States. After Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping visited Japan in 1978, he tried to copy the Japanese playbook, but bureaucratic infighting got in the way, and centrally planned tech-import schemes misfired. A breakthrough arrived in 1979, with the creation of special economic zones, regions permitted to experiment with market economics, in Guangdong and, later, Fujian. With business-friendly regulations, these southern provinces were able to attract foreign capital and swiftly became the heart of China’s electronics and computing industries. China’s leading computer firms, Legend (now Lenovo) and Great Wall, were founded in Beijing but soon relocated significant production and research to the south, where they could plug in to global supply chains.
By the first decade of this century, targeted industrial policy had largely receded. What ultimately fueled China’s rise were countless local experiments, backed by a central state able to scale up those that worked. Rural reforms in 1978–79, which permitted farmers to sell extra produce after they met their quotas, became the foundation of Deng’s dual-track approach, with plan quotas alongside market sales. Such changes did not transform China into a full-fledged market economy—the country still lacked secure property rights and the rule of law—but they created transitional institutions that mimicked the effects of one. Tens of thousands of local governments competed for investment and talent, behaving more like firms than governments because their leaders’ careers depended on delivering results.
The Chinese Communist Party, however, retained control over the most important lever: personnel. By appointing, rewarding, and disciplining local leaders, it introduced incentives that resembled those of a market economy while still preserving political authority at the top, resulting in a hybrid system that the economist Branko Milanovic has aptly described as “political capitalism.”

 In China, business dynamism has ebbed and productivity has sagged.
Political capitalism is well suited for catch-up growth because clear targets (exports, investment, infrastructure) are easy to measure. Yet as China moves closer to the technological frontier, where success depends on unpredictable breakthrough innovations, top-down monitoring becomes more difficult, and the system grows more vulnerable to cronyism. Because innovation payoffs are uncertain and hard to quantify, performance targets invite gaming; officials can hit numerical goals, such as patent counts, without fostering genuinely new technologies.
A challenge that would normally call for more decentralization—stronger policies to enable competition and wider room for local trial and error—has instead been met with greater centralization. In 2008, the National People’s Congress passed an antimonopoly law, but authorities have applied it selectively to discipline foreign firms and powerful entrepreneurs while protecting state-owned firms.
Control over the private sector has tightened in other ways, as well. Beijing has taken shares of companies such as Alibaba, ByteDance, and Tencent, and politically connected citizens have seen their portfolios grow markedly. Meanwhile, the state has tried to shape the direction of innovation through major initiatives such as a 2003 drive to build national champions, a 2006 effort to expand research and development in science and technology, and more recent projects including Made in China 2025 and Internet Plus, which have channeled trillions of yuan in subsidies, tax breaks, and state-guided venture capital into semiconductors, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and advanced robotics. As Beijing has oriented the economy around missions such as common prosperity and technological self-reliance, state-owned enterprises have expanded because they are easier to steer toward national goals that do not prioritize profit, while leading private firms, wary of interference, increasingly avoid investors with state ties.
As authority has concentrated in Beijing, local experimentation has waned, and accountability has shifted from performance to political loyalty. State-owned enterprises remain weak innovators and are largely absent from the most dynamic arenas, such as digital platforms, e-commerce, and AI. Private national champions cannot substitute for broad-based dynamism. And smaller private enterprises and foreign-invested firms—the usual sources of novelty—face rising barriers. Since the early years of this century, business dynamism has ebbed and productivity has sagged, turning negative after the global financial crisis of 2007–9 and slowing markedly through the 2010s. Some slowdown is natural as China’s economy catches up, but the trajectory points to a plateau at a far lower income level than in Japan, South Korea, or Taiwan.
THE RIGHT LESSONS
Washington must draw the right lessons from China’s rise—and from how the United States once outcompeted Japan. Like Japan in the 1980s, China is a manufacturing powerhouse moving up the value chain. Its advantage lies not in radical innovation but in scale, integration, and rapid iteration, backed by state coordination and heavy investment. Consider high‑speed rail. China assembled foreign technologies (from France’s Alstom, Canada’s Bombardier, Japan’s Kawasaki, and Germany’s Siemens) and then scaled at record speed, opening its first passenger‑dedicated line in 2008 and building the world’s largest network, spanning roughly 30,000 miles, by the end of last year.


China is following the same script across telecommunications, solar power equipment, and batteries. What Apple did for China’s smartphone ecosystem—training Chinese suppliers that later partnered with firms such as Huawei—Tesla is now doing for Chinese electric vehicle producers. As a latecomer, China has often leaped straight to modern systems—think Beijing Daxing International Airport, with its facial recognition entry systems, geothermal heat pumps, and radio frequency–based baggage tracking. Meanwhile, the United States struggles to upgrade legacy infrastructure. Because the U.S. system disperses power—among a separately elected president, a bicameral Congress, an independent judiciary, and federal, state, and local governments—many actors can block action. Veto points designed as safeguards often slow decisions and hinder the adoption of new technologies and reforms.
For the United States, the politically tempting response is protectionism that shelters incumbents and concedes the future. A better course is diversified interdependence. There are valid security reasons to reduce exposure to China at specific nodes, such as critical minerals, but self-sufficiency is a mirage. The way to blunt Beijing’s leverage is not to sever trade ties but to spur integration with allies such as Mexico and South Korea. Historically, the United States prospered by wiring itself into global networks and turning them to its advantage.
Keeping markets competitive matters just as much. The computer revolution was possible only because startups such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft went public and stayed independent. In the 1980s and 1990s, easier listings and deepening venture capital made initial public offerings the default. But beginning in the first decade of this century, more stringent investor protections—notably under the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which tightened oversight of public companies by creating an audit watchdog, making CEOs and CFOs personally certify their financial reports, and requiring yearly proof that antifraud controls actually work—raised the costs and risks of going public, especially for smaller issuers. At the same time, more permissive merger review processes and antitrust enforcement made it easier for dominant platforms to buy fast-growing entrants. Competition has cooled as a result.

 Historically, the United States prospered by wiring itself into global networks.
What changed wasn’t only doctrine but also incentives. After Buckley v. Valeo—the 1976 Supreme Court decision that equated limits on political expenditures to limits on speech—corporate money poured into politics. From 1980 to 2012, donations from senior executives rose 320-fold, with half coming from the top 0.01 percent of donors. Lobbying outlays have more than doubled since the late 1990s, driven largely by the biggest firms. Although the top four companies in a typical industry capture about 15 percent of revenues, they supply roughly 35 percent of campaign contributions and 45 percent of lobbying expenditures. This pressure has worked: the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice rarely enforce the antitrust laws already on the books.
Rebuilding a more competitive system will require lowering the cost of going public for new companies and sharpening scrutiny of incumbent takeovers so that more high-growth firms can scale independently. The immediate test is in AI. OpenAI, through its deep partnership with Microsoft, now accounts for roughly two-thirds of the market. Incumbents are also major financiers and partners in the AI ecosystem; Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft have taken stakes in or signed multiyear deals with leading AI startups. The question is whether leading labs go public and remain independent or whether exclusive partnerships and acquisition-led consolidation prevail.
Consolidation would be easier to defend if brute-force scaling alone drove AI progress, but it doesn’t. Ideas and rivalry, not sheer resource mobilization, move the frontier. In China, performance is strongest in sectors—such as AI, electric vehicles, and solar power systems—in which competition is fierce and in which oversupply has driven price collapses and even prompted Beijing to rein in “disorderly” low-price competition. By contrast, sectors dominated by old-guard monopolists and state-owned enterprises underperform.
China is not Japan. Its market is larger and its state support heavier. And for the United States, the security stakes of this competition are much higher. But the same rule holds: the United States should resist fortress economics. Treat Beijing as a serious competitor, not as a blueprint.]]></content>

        <updated>2025-10-01T04:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The countries of the Middle East increasingly see Israel as their new shared threat. Israel’s war in Gaza, its expansionist military policies, and its revisionist posture are reshaping the region in ways that few anticipated. Its September strike on Hamas’s political leaders in Qatar—the seventh country hit by Israel since the October 7, 2023, attacks, in addition to the Palestinian territories—has shaken Gulf states and cast doubt on the credibility of the U.S. security umbrella. In the last two years, Israeli leaders have hailed their evisceration of Hezbollah’s leadership in Lebanon, their repeated strikes on targets in Yemen, and their battering of Iran. But rather than consolidate Israeli power or improve relations with Arab states that have long been wary of Iran and its proxies, these actions are backfiring. States that once regarded Israel as a potential partner, including the Gulf monarchies, now perceive it as a dangerous and unpredictable actor.
This week, U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a new 20-point “peace plan,” celebrating the framework as a major breakthrough and a way to return stability to the region. But its prospects are dim as long as Israel continues to behave aggressively and ignores the legitimate demands and concerns of Palestinians. Although a raft of leaders in the region have welcomed the announcement, the plan seems unlikely to reverse the damage of two years of war. Before the October 2023 attacks, Israel, with strong American backing, had hoped to remake the region to its advantage, casting itself as a partner for Arab governments while sidelining rivals, notably Iran. Now, Israel has only isolated itself, made Arab states reluctant to stomach the reputational and political costs of working with it, and turned former partners into wary adversaries.
Many countries in the region are responding to Israeli aggression by diversifying their security partnerships, investing in their own autonomy, and moving away from normalization with Israel. A welter of projects that sought to bind Israel closer to Arab countries—principally with the help of the United States, but also with Indian and European support—will likely fall by the wayside. That is bad news not just for Israel but also for the United States. Unstinting American support for Israel is undermining Washington’s standing in the region. Where once the threat of Iran could encourage states in the region to hew close to the U.S. line, the specter of a bristling Israel now pushes them away from the United States.
The United States must wake up to the shifts underway in the Middle East. On its own, the recently proposed framework will not repair the ruptured relations between Israel and the broader region. If Washington refuses to rein in Israel and does not search for a just political answer to the Palestinian question, it risks weakening ties with key regional partners and losing influence over the emerging regional order. Failing to address the issue of Palestine and allowing Israel to behave aggressively with impunity will also fuel a new wave of radicalism that will threaten U.S. interests, regional stability, and global security.
HOW TO LOSE FRIENDS
For more than two decades, Israel had been able to make common cause with a number of Arab countries. Egypt was the first Arab state to normalize relations with Israel as a result of the 1978 Camp David accords. The peace between the two countries has held for nearly four decades, even though significant connections and exchanges at a deeper societal level have failed to materialize. Until recently, Egypt viewed Turkey as its primary rival in the eastern Mediterranean. Relations between the two countries took a nosedive in 2013 after the overthrow of Mohamed Morsi, Egypt’s first democratically elected Islamist president. Turkey strongly supported him and opposed the coup that brought Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to power. As a result, Egypt under Sisi cut bilateral deals with Israel and worked with Israel inside the East Mediterranean Gas Forum, a regional organization that coordinates energy development to encourage the joint exploration of offshore gas reserves. Those moves also had the implicit goal of countering Turkish claims in the Mediterranean. Beyond energy cooperation, Egypt has also deepened its security coordination with Israel in the Sinai desert, allowing Israeli strikes against militant groups there and helping manage the Gaza border.


That all changed after the October 7, 2023, attacks. Israel’s campaigns have forced Cairo to take a different position. In September, Sisi labeled Israel an “enemy,” a significant rhetorical departure from decades of careful language from Egyptian statesmen. He also took the symbolic step of downgrading security cooperation with Israel. Egypt and its erstwhile rival Turkey undertook a joint naval drill in the eastern Mediterranean, aiming to deepen their defense cooperation.
Before the current war, certain Gulf states tentatively aligned with Israel because they regarded Iran as the paramount threat to their security. Iran’s disruptions in the region, including its cultivation of armed groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen and its nuclear ambitions, made cooperation between Gulf monarchies and Israel a convenient choice. The rise of political Islam and the 2011 Arab uprisings strengthened this alignment, as Gulf rulers and Israel alike feared that these movements could topple regimes, reshape the region, and constrain Israel’s regional role. The Abraham Accords, the normalization deals negotiated between Israel and a handful of Arab states in 2020 with help from the United States—emerged from this context, with the central imperative of containing Iran and insulating regimes from any prospective domestic and regional transformation.

 Israel has turned former partners into wary adversaries.
Today, however, the logic of normalization is unraveling. Israel’s new forward defense doctrine, which has it breaching the sovereignty of other states at will, is making almost all the states in the region feel insecure. The devastating war in Gaza, the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank (often justified with religious rhetoric), Israel’s uncompromising approach in Lebanon, and its repeated strikes in Syria and encroachment into Syrian territory, have turned the maintenance of formal ties with Israel into a political and strategic liability for Arab governments. Indeed, Israeli actions have provoked such outrage across the Arab world that any form of visible alignment with Israel has become a direct threat to the legitimacy and security of regimes. According to an analysis of recent surveys by the research group Arab Barometer, public backing for normalization with Israel remains extremely low across the region, with no country exceeding 13 percent support and Morocco dropping from 31 percent in 2022 to just 13 percent in 2023 after the October 7 attacks. 
Saudi Arabia, once under intense American pressure to normalize relations with Israel, now hesitates not only because of domestic risks but also because of doubts over Israel’s reliability as a strategic partner, given the range of aggressive Israeli actions in recent years. The United Arab Emirates, once Israel’s closest ally in the Gulf, has paid reputational costs among the publics of Arab and Muslim countries for defending the Abraham Accords even as Israeli leaders openly discuss the depopulation of Gaza and the potential annexation of the West Bank. After Israel’s strike on Hamas negotiators in Doha, Qatar has positioned itself as the principal Arab critic of Israeli policy in Gaza. Kuwait and Oman remain aloof and wary of being drawn into any association with Israel that could undermine the domestic legitimacy of their governments, antagonize their publics, or complicate their careful regional balancing strategies. Israel, once imagined by some Gulf and U.S. policymakers as a potential pillar of Gulf security, is now seen as a liability and a destabilizing threat.
Turkey’s reversal is equally striking. For years, Ankara condemned Israel for its treatment of the Palestinians but did not consider it a direct security rival. Israel, for its part, did not overtly seek to antagonize Turkey in geopolitical and security matters. During a 2020 standoff between Greece and Turkey in the eastern Mediterranean, Israel took a far less confrontational stance toward Turkey than did Egypt and a slew of European countries. During the 2023 war between Azerbaijan and Armenia, both Israel and Turkey supported Azerbaijan and provided its military with equipment. Israeli President Isaac Herzog paid an official visit to Ankara in 2022, and only weeks before October 7, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, exploring potential energy cooperation in the eastern Mediterranean.
The war in Gaza has pushed the two countries further apart. Turkey has suspended trade with and closed its airspace to Israel as punishment for the campaign in Gaza. Israeli actions in Syria have also deeply alarmed Turkey: its longest land border is with Syria, and millions of refugees have crossed into Turkey since the eruption of the Syrian civil war over a decade ago. Ankara wants a stable neighbor and a centralized Damascus. Israel, by contrast, has been supporting minority groups in southern Syria, as well as advancing into Syrian territory, undermining the country’s new government and promoting division and instability. As Syria becomes a key zone of geopolitical contestation, Turkey now perceives Israel as a major threat.
LOOKING ELSEWHERE
Israel’s revisionism and aggression are also accelerating militarization and a diversification in defense strategies across the region. States are drawing lessons from these two years of conflict, including the poor performance of Russian weaponry in the conflict between Iran and Israel and the political and security constraints that come with reliance on American weapons systems. Governments are hedging by investing in domestic capabilities and diversifying their suppliers. Saudi Arabia has expanded cooperation with China on missiles and drones, sought to further localize defense production, and recently signed a defense cooperation pact with Pakistan signaling its desire for alternative security partnerships and intent to build ties with a fellow Muslim power outside the U.S.-led security architecture. The United Arab Emirates has purchased French fighter jets and partnered with South Korea on missile defense and nuclear energy, strengthening its technological capacities while reducing its dependence on the United States. Qatar and Kuwait have respectively acquired Eurofighter Typhoons from the United Kingdom and Italy, embedding themselves further in European security networks. Gulf countries are all buying cost-effective Turkish drones. For its part, Turkey unveiled its Steel Dome integrated air defense system in August, comparable to Israel’s Iron Dome system of antimissile defense—suggesting a doctrinal shift in which Turkish planners now feel obliged to measure their capacities against Israel’s.


This widening network of partnerships leaves shrinking space for Israel. Regional initiatives such as the Abraham Accords; the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, a U.S.-backed trade and connectivity project linking India, the Middle East, and Europe; the Negev Summit, a regional security forum that brought Israel together with Arab and Western partners; and I2U2, grouping India, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States for technological and economic cooperation, were designed to build a new order rooted in Arab-Israeli cooperation under American supervision. The goal was to bind Arab states to Israel, exclude Turkey, and contain Iran. American and Israeli officials assumed that normalization and greater acceptance of Israel in the region were inevitable. That vision is collapsing. Israeli policy has made the very subject toxic, turning normalization into a domestic and strategic risk for Arab leaders and their governments.

 The logic behind normalizing relations with Israel is unraveling.
The Israeli attack in Doha underscored these dynamics. Qatar is a mediator between Israel and Hamas, as well as a close American ally hosting the largest U.S. base in the region. The attack undermined not only Qatar but also American prestige and credibility: from that episode, Gulf rulers have taken the lesson that Israel is unpredictable and aggressive—and American security guarantees are unreliable. As a result, they will seek diversified relations with other powers and expanded investment in homegrown defense industries.
These developments will create new alignments that could reshape the region. Turkey and Saudi Arabia, two of the most significant regional powers, will likely cooperate more closely. Although they were previously rivals in many regional hot spots, including in Libya, the two now share concerns about regional instability and Israel’s disruptive role. They could work together to try to stabilize Syria and coordinate joint efforts in multilateral forums to push for ending the war in Gaza and restraining Israeli aggression. Indeed, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has called for the establishment of a joint security platform with regional states, notably Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Both Erdogan and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia must manage domestic political costs from the Gazan war. Erdogan faced mounting public anger over continued trade with Israel, which Ankara has since suspended, and pressure from Islamist and conservative constituencies to take a harder line; Mohammed faces criticism within his kingdom and in the wider Arab world for having even considered normalization with Israel. Both must also contend with the prospect of further conflict between Israel and Iran.
To be sure, Iran has not disappeared as a concern, and its regional network of proxies is weakened but not eliminated. Saudi Arabia and Turkey will have to tread carefully. For Saudi Arabia, that means continuing the cautious détente with Iran that was launched with Chinese mediation in 2023, reducing escalation risks in Yemen and the Gulf. For Turkey, it means balancing cooperation and competition in Iraq, Syria, and the South Caucasus. Both Saudi Arabia and Turkey are seeking to ensure that they can counter Iran without making it feel cornered, since a cornered Iran could double down on asymmetric tactics and create new crises.
A CREDIBLE ORDER
For the United States, these dynamics demand a reevaluation of strategy. U.S. policymakers are missing the profound alarm caused by Israel’s actions, and they must reckon with the ensuing imperative in the region to diversify security partnerships. Continued unconditional support for Israel undermines American influence and reinforces perceptions that Washington sees the region solely through the prism of Israeli interests. Regional elites are already hedging by cultivating China, Europe, Russia, and other powers. This trend will only accelerate as long as the United States blithely backs Israel and ignores the attending collateral damage to its own relations with other regional countries. Without a course correction, the United States will be left behind in a region defined less by the challenge posed by Iran than by the revisionist and disruptive role of Israel. If it fails to adjust, Washington will end up being complicit in the demolition of the very strategic architecture it has sought for years to build in the Middle East.
With its considerable heft, the United States will no doubt remain an important actor in the region for the foreseeable future. But to preserve its credibility and influence, it must recalibrate its approach by directly addressing the concerns of Egypt, the Gulf states, and Turkey and working toward cooperative security frameworks that prioritize de-escalation, conflict prevention, and economic integration. That would be a sharp departure from its recent track record of encouraging the militarization of the region and bloc politics. Washington must further anchor U.S. policy in support of a just resolution of the Palestinian question. Ending Israel’s crushing campaign in Gaza, preventing the depopulation of the territory, stopping the manmade famine there, and halting the annexation of the West Bank should be the starting points. The United States cannot skirt the plight of the Palestinians and ignore Israeli revisionism if it wants to foster a functional and credible regional order.]]></content>

An illegible prescription by an Indian doctor in Madhya Pradesh state last year went viral


ByGeeta Pandey
BBC News, Delhi




Published
1 October 2025




At a time when most people use keyboards to write, does handwriting really matter?
Yes, say Indian courts, if the writer is a doctor.
Jokes around the notoriously bad handwriting of many doctors that can only be deciphered by pharmacists are common in India, as around the world. But the latest order emphasising the importance of clear handwriting came recently from the Punjab and Haryana High Court which said that "legible medical prescription is a fundamental right" as it can make a difference between life and death.
The court order came in a case that had nothing to do with the written word. It involved allegations of rape, cheating and forgery by a woman and Justice Jasgurpreet Singh Puri was hearing the man's petition for bail.
The woman had alleged that the man had taken money from her promising her a government job, conducted fake interviews with her and sexually exploited her.
The accused denied the charges - he said they had a consensual relationship and the case was brought on because of a dispute over money.
Justice Puri said when he looked at the medico-legal report - written by a government doctor who had examined the woman - he found it incomprehensible.
"It shook the conscience of this court as not even a word or a letter was legible," he wrote in the order.
The BBC has seen a copy of the judgement which includes the report and a two-page prescription which shows the doctor's unreadable scrawl.

"At a time when technology and computers are easily accessible, it is shocking that government doctors are still writing prescriptions by hand which cannot be read by anybody except perhaps some chemists," Justice Puri wrote.
The court asked the government to include handwriting lessons in the medical school curriculum and set a two-year timeline for rolling out digitised prescriptions.
Until that happens, all doctors must write prescriptions clearly in capital letters, Justice Puri said.
Dr Dilip Bhanushali, president of Indian Medical Association that has more than 330,000 doctors as members, told the BBC that they're willing to help find a solution to the problem.
In cities and bigger towns, he says, doctors have moved to digital prescriptions, but it's very difficult in rural areas and small towns to get prescriptions that are clear.
"It's a well-known fact that many doctors have poor handwriting, but that's because most medical practitioners are very busy, especially in overcrowded government hospitals," he says.
"We have recommended to our members to follow the government guidelines and write prescriptions in bold letters that should be readable to both patients and chemists. A doctor who sees seven patients a day can do it, but if you see 70 patients a day, you can't do it," he adds.

Experts say a prescription that leaves room for ambiguity or misinterpretation can have serious consequences


This is not the first time an Indian court has called out sloppy handwriting of doctors. Past instances include the high court in Odisha state which flagged, external "the zigzag style of writing by doctors" and judges in Allahabad high court who lamented, external about "reports written in such shabby handwriting that they are not decipherable". 
Studies, however, have failed to support, external the conventional wisdom that doctors' handwriting is worse than others. 
But experts say emphasis on their handwriting is not about aesthetics or convenience but a medical prescription that leaves room for ambiguity or misinterpretation can have serious - even tragic - consequences.
According to a 1999 report, external by the Institute of Medicine (IoM), medical errors caused at least an estimated 44,000 preventable deaths annually in the US, of which 7,000 were attributable to sloppy handwriting. 
More recently, in Scotland a woman suffered chemical injuries after she was mistakenly given erectile dysfunction cream for a dry eye condition. 
Health authorities in the UK have admitted that "drug errors caused appalling levels of harm and deaths" and added that "roll out of electronic prescribing systems across more hospitals could reduce errors by 50%".  
India does not have robust data on harm caused by poor handwriting, but in the world's most populous country misreading of prescriptions in the past has resulted in health emergencies and many deaths.

Pharmacists say that badly-written prescriptions continue to arrive at their shops


There's this much reported case, external of a woman who suffered from convulsions after taking a medicine for diabetes which had a similar sounding name to an analgesic she had been prescribed. 
Chilukuri Paramathama, who runs a pharmacy in Nalgonda city in the southern Indian state of Telangana, told the BBC that in 2014, he filed a public interest petition in the high court in Hyderabad after reading news reports about a three-year-old who had died in Noida city after she was administered a wrong injection for fever.
His campaign, seeking a complete ban on handwritten prescriptions, bore fruit when in 2016, the Medical Council of India ordered that "every physician should prescribe drugs with generic names legibly and preferably in capital letters".
In 2020, India's junior health minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey told the parliament that medical authorities in states "have been empowered to take disciplinary action against a doctor for violating the order".
But nearly a decade later, Mr Chilukuri and other pharmacists say that badly-written prescriptions continue to arrive at their shops. Mr Chilukuri sent the BBC a number of prescriptions he's seen over the past few years that even he could not decipher.  
Ravindra Khandelwal, the CEO of Dhanwantary - one of Kolkata city's best-known pharmacies with 28 branches covering cities, towns and villages in West Bengal and serving more than 4,000 customers daily - says sometimes prescriptions that come to them border on the illegible.
"Over the years, we've seen a shift from handwritten to printed prescriptions in cities, but in suburban and rural areas, most are still handwritten."
His staff, he says, are very experienced and able to decipher most of them to ensure customers get the right medicine.
"Even so, sometimes we have to call the doctors because it's very important for us to dispense the correct medicine."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Greek lawmakers could soon introduce the 13-hour workday. But workers and unions vehemently reject the plan. They have announced a general strike for Wednesday. 
    Wednesday’s general strike could bring much of Greece to a grinding halt Image: Costas Baltas/Anadolu/picture alliance    
"I can't work 13 hours a day, and I don't expect that from my employees," says Anni, who owns a beauty salon by the name of "64" in Pagrati, central Athens. She doubts any of her clients would be satisfied with the work of an exhausted beautician either. That is why she wonders why Greek Labor Minister Niki Kerameos wants to create the legal foundation for a 13-hour workday.
Kerameos has told reporters that this is merely about allowing exceptions on 37 days a year "in the interests of employees."
Greek labor unions, meanwhile, reject the minister's plans and are trying to overturn the bill, which will soon be introduced in parliament. They have called for a general strike on October 1 and want to bring Greece to a grinding halt: No ships will leave the ports, planes will remain grounded and no trains will be running.
Six-day work week
Under Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Greece's conservative government has transformed the country's labor market into one of the most "flexible" in Europe. Since July 2024, employees in industry, retail, agriculture and some service sectors have been forced to work six-day weeks if that's what their employer wants. They are, however, paid an extra 40% on top of their ordinary wage for the sixth working day.

The 40-hour week still applies in Greece, but employers are allowed to demand up to two hours of unpaid overtime per day for a limited period in return for more time off. In theory, this overtime is voluntary, though in many companies, employees are forced to work longer hours without receiving extra compensation.
The 13-hour workday should also be voluntary, says Minister Kerameos, with no one obliged to work overtime.
Longer working hours could harm productivity
But will an employee really refuse to do overtime when asked by an employer? Theodoros Koutroukis, a professor of labor relations at Democritus University of Thrace, doubts it.
"This is not possible without consequences, because the employee only has minimal bargaining power," says Koutroukis.
He warns that the new legislation will not have a positive impact on the labor market. Koutroukis says extending daily working hours will reduce employees' job satisfaction and productivity. This, in turn, could lead to a deterioration in the quality of goods and services and even increase unit labor costs. In addition, Koutroukis says, extended working hours could affect employees' work-life balance, and limit their ability to spend time getting professional training.

Koutroukis also warns that extending possible daily working hours does not do anything to deepen the relationship between workers and employers overall. He instead suggests allowing for additional working hours only for short periods in exceptional cases where it appears necessary for a certain industry. This arrangement, Koutroukis says, could be agreed upon between employers and employees through the mechanism of collective bargaining.


Further liberalizations planned
Kerameos' draft bill also proposes a "flexible" distribution of vacation days, the flexible and short-term allocation of 120 minutes of overtime per day, and the ability to reach employees via an app. A four-day week with a 40-hour working week would also be possible. All these changes are being proposed to fulfill "urgent company needs."
Minister Kerameos has been raving about the envisioned labor market reform, praising it for "adapting [Greek] legislation to reality." 
Labor market experts, on the other hand, say the move legalizes all labor rights violations that have been committed by employers.
Many Greeks are forced to work two jobs due to low wages. If the new labor market bill is passed, Greeks will be able to work 13 hours a day for a single employer.
"If you can do this with two employers, i.e. take your motorcycle and change your workplace, why shouldn't you have the opportunity to do this with one employer, and earn an additional 40%," wonders Kerameos.

This raises the question why so many Greeks cannot live on their 40-hour jobs and have to rely on overtime or two jobs to make ends meet. Eurostat, the European Union's statistical office, reports that Greeks work 1,886 hours per year, more than any other European nation. Yet despite this, Greeks have lower productivity — perhaps because they work so much — and lower purchasing power (30% below the European Union average) than most Europeans. So although the Greeks are already working many hours, the government wants to increase their workload even more.

Greek trade unions up in arms
Greek trade union federation GSEE rejects the planned 13-hour workday. The upcoming labor rights protest in Athens will be held under the motto of "exhaustion is not recovery, human resilience has limits."
GSEE is campaigning to reduce working hours to 37.5 hours per week, as is already the case in many European countries.
In its call for a general strike on October 1, the GSEE leadership takes a defiant tone: "Greek workers, who already work more hours per year than any of their colleagues in the European Union, and many of whom report suffering from burnout and overwork, are facing a dystopia. Enough is enough. We can't take it anymore."
Whether this strike will avert the 13-hour working day remains to be seen. In any case, Greece appears to be moving towards further labor market liberalization at a time when many people in the European Union are demanding a 35-hour or four-day work week.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Since Myanmar’s military overthrew the country’s democratically elected government in 2021, it has ruled with devastating violence. Junta forces have bombed civilians in a bid to suppress rebellious provinces, killing thousands. Junta-supported paramilitary groups have targeted political opponents and their families. And the regime has furthered an ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya, a Muslim-minority population. Since 2017, Myanmar’s military has killed tens of thousands of Rohingya and exiled hundreds of thousands more to neighboring Bangladesh; in early 2025, the junta cut off food and supplies to the 130,000 Rohingya in Myanmar living in prison-like refugee camps, leading to starvation and disease.
Distracted by crises elsewhere and reconsidering its geopolitical priorities, the United States has mostly ignored the situation in Myanmar. American policymakers have also assumed that the risks of entanglement in the country—which has a long history of periods of military rule—outweigh the rewards. But U.S. passivity has not just contributed to the dire circumstances for civilians in Myanmar. It has also undercut the United States’ position in Asia by creating space for China to exploit Myanmar’s instability. Beijing, willing to back any regime regardless of its ideology or tactics, has stepped into the breach left by Washington’s inaction.
It is not too late for a change in U.S. strategy. Despite years of sitting on the sidelines, the United States has an opportunity to reassert itself in seeking to end the depredations of the junta and advance the cause of democracy in Myanmar. Myanmar’s military junta is struggling financially, even with Chinese support, and the United States has a powerful economic arsenal it can deploy. If the United States has the will to regain its influence in Myanmar and the region, there are straightforward ways it can use economic tools to shape the balance of power in Myanmar.
FROM BEIJING TO YANGON
China has long had its sights on Myanmar as part of its larger Belt and Road Initiative, a vast infrastructure investment program that seeks to boost China’s growth prospects and political influence. Myanmar’s strategic location between China’s southwestern provinces and the Indian Ocean has made it a priority for leaders in Beijing, who have inked numerous deals for Chinese-backed ports, railways, and pipelines.
One of China’s key projects in Myanmar, the Kyaukpyu port in Rakhine State, along the country’s long western coastline, reveals Beijing’s playbook. The deep-water port will allow large Chinese cargo and energy ships to bypass the Strait of Malacca, the narrow waterway between Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore through which China conducts two-thirds of its maritime trade and imports 80 percent of its oil. Port access in Myanmar provides China a way to maneuver around a potential U.S.-led blockade in the Strait of Malacca if conflict arose, for instance, in the Taiwan Strait.


The port and its accompanying special economic zone are estimated to cost $10 billion. Chinese state-owned enterprises are financing the effort and will control the port’s operations. China International Trust Investment Corporation, one of China’s largest such enterprises, will hold a 70 percent stake in the port and will have an exclusive contract to operate it for 50 years, with a possible 25-year extension. Former high-level officials in Myanmar’s deposed civilian government estimate that half the remaining 30 percent stake held by Myanmar is loaned from China, which means that approximately two percent of Myanmar’s GDP is tied up in opaque contracts with Chinese banks.
This project is more likely to trap Myanmar in debt than benefit its economy. The financial terms for the Kyaukpyu port are even less favorable than those of other prominent Belt and Road Initiative projects that have saddled host countries with debt, such as the Hambantota port in Sri Lanka. Chinese banks lent money to Myanmar at commercial rates, rather than offering concessional loans typically used in development projects, and the deal included expansive provisions to use land as collateral. Moreover, the conditions for a massive port project to benefit the local economy do not exist in Rakhine State: most residents are small-scale rice farmers, and roughly 80 percent of the population lives below Myanmar’s poverty line. There is no local economy to support such a large infrastructure investment, which means that the workers to build and run the port will come from elsewhere. In the familiar pattern of BRI projects, those workers will likely be Chinese.

 Myanmar’s military junta is struggling financially.
China struck many of these deals in the early 2010s, when military generals held the main levers of power in Myanmar. The subsequent democratic government delayed the projects while it investigated their economic viability. After the 2021 coup, however, the junta restored and accelerated these Chinese investment projects. The junta’s leaders, who desperately need foreign assistance, find it difficult to say no to China even if the projects are overpriced and overload Myanmar with debt.
Myanmar has a constitutional ban on the presence of foreign militaries in the country, but China’s leverage over the junta suggests that this will not prevent the Chinese navy from using the deep-water port if it wants. The Chinese navy already makes port calls in Myanmar, but these are brief stays in facilities too primitive to provide naval advantage. Beijing also sells weapons to the Arakan Army, a paramilitary group, which is fighting against the junta in Rakhine State. If the junta’s leaders were to try to prevent China from conducting military activities at Kyaukpyu, China could further seed insurgencies near the port to protect its investments. Supporting opposition groups in Rakhine benefits China by keeping the ruling junta weak—and therefore more likely to comply with Beijing’s demands.
China’s economic leverage over the junta also supports its global dominance of rare-earth elements. Nearly two-thirds of dysprosium and terbium, two key rare-earth elements, come from northern Myanmar. China’s monopoly on processing these elements into magnets has given Beijing a strategic chokepoint in the global economy. In exchange, China has protected the junta by vetoing tougher sanctions at the United Nations and other international forums. Chinese leader Xi Jinping and the junta chief Min Aung Hlaing met in Moscow in May to discuss cooperation, endowing the junta with an air of global legitimacy.
MONEY WOES
The junta’s economic lifelines actively undercut U.S. interests. Its leaders have forged deep partnerships with paramilitary groups, such as the Karen National Army, whose actions harm Americans. Unlike some other ethnic armed organizations leading insurgencies against the junta, the KNA is a pro-junta militia formally folded into the army’s command. The junta works with the KNA on business ventures in mining, utilities, and smuggling, and KNA leader Saw Chit Thu has made high-profile donations to powerful Buddhist leaders with close ties to the junta. In May, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned the KNA as a transnational criminal organization for its role in facilitating exploitative cyber-scams that cost U.S. citizens $3.5 billion in 2023.


The junta has also revived Myanmar’s role as a center of international narcotics trafficking and production. Before being deposed in the coup, the democratically elected government installed x-ray scanners and police along major trafficking routes, which effectively reduced the flow of heroin and methamphetamine into the United States. The junta’s leaders have not only gutted these efforts; they have also repurposed the scanners to search for weapons among their political enemies. Poppy cultivation and fentanyl production in Myanmar have surged, contributing to the devastating opioid epidemic in the United States.
Despite investment from Beijing and money flowing in from illicit activity, however, the junta finds itself in a precarious financial situation. It needs seemingly endless amounts of foreign exchange to support its military operations. To address this, Myanmar’s central bank has printed money on an unprecedented scale. Since the coup in 2021, the central bank has issued 30 trillion kyat—a tenfold increase over the roughly three trillion kyat printed in 2020. The result has been runaway inflation and a collapse in confidence in Myanmar’s currency, which has dropped 80 percent in value since 2021. The regime now relies on remittances and natural resource sales for U.S. dollars to purchase fuel, chemicals, and weapons from China and Russia, which won’t accept payment in kyat.
Myanmar’s central bank has reoriented its monetary policy to support the junta’s access to foreign currency reserves. Since 2021, the central bank has issued more than a dozen directives to further this goal, including forcing migrant workers to convert remittances into kyat, imposing a tiered exchange rate system based on military priorities to more cheaply procure weapons, and revoking foreign exchange licenses from some independent businesses to channel limited foreign currency toward buying arms. The central bank even suspended debt repayments on approved foreign loans, which effectively triggered a state-engineered default and undercut prior efforts to establish Myanmar’s creditworthiness. These central bank policies have boosted the junta’s supply of dollars to bolster its military cache, but they have damaged the country’s exporters and importers and decimated its economic growth potential.
SANCTIONING CHANGE
When the United States has on rare occasions exercised its influence in Myanmar, its efforts have had an impact. In 2023, for instance, the United States sanctioned the Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank, the primary vehicle for official foreign exchange. The effect was immediate: international transactions involving the MFTB fell from more than $500 million in the first quarter of 2023 to just over $80 million in the second quarter of that year. But the regime quickly adapted, shifting banking operations to the state-owned Myanmar Economic Bank, which saw the value of its transactions grow from less than $80 million to $495 million.
The United States should not only sanction the Myanmar Economic Bank; it should also target the central bank, which controls the MEB and other state-owned financial institutions. Policymakers should mark the central bank as a Specially Designated National under the Burma Sanctions Program administered by the U.S. Treasury. This would effectively cut off Myanmar’s state-owned oil and gas company from foreign markets and prevent the junta’s defense ministry from purchasing arms from China and Russia, which often insist on being paid in U.S. dollars for military equipment.
The United States should use its economic weapons not only to disempower the junta but also to support its replacement. Fortunately, Myanmar already has a viable political alternative—the National Unity Government, the coalition of democratically elected lawmakers ousted in 2021. The United States should formally recognize the NUG and amplify the impact of central bank sanctions by repurposing frozen funds held at the U.S. Federal Reserve. The New York Fed currently holds more than $1 billion in frozen funds belonging to Myanmar’s central bank. The U.S. Treasury could redirect the interest earned on these immobilized assets to the NUG, as it has done with Russian funds to support Ukraine.

 Economic measures could force the junta to accept concrete concessions.
Additionally, the United States should provide technical assistance and credit guarantees to support alternative financial infrastructure in Myanmar, such as the NUG-controlled online Spring Development Bank, which provides banking services to workers and refugees around the world. The U.S. State Department could also put pressure on Thailand, a close U.S. ally, to crack down on increasing arms trafficking to Myanmar. U.S. and UN pressure on Singapore reduced weapons transfers through the city-state to Myanmar by 83 percent between April 2023 and March 2024. The same can work in Thailand alongside the threat of secondary sanctions on private Thai financial institutions.
By cutting off the junta’s means of purchasing weapons, these economic measures could force the junta to accept concrete concessions, including agreeing to cease-fires with insurgent groups, increasing humanitarian aid for civilians, and establishing a road map to repatriate and protect the Rohingya. Ideally, U.S. pressure would also push the junta’s leaders to transition back to a more democratic political system. Short of these goals, however, U.S. economic measures could still improve the situation in Myanmar. They could increase the cost of the junta’s weapons purchases and deter international banks, insurers, and transportation companies from abetting Myanmar’s military deals. And these actions would signal U.S. resolve to get involved in the region, which would encourage regulators and private-sector compliance teams to more strictly monitor illegal activity.


The potential benefits to the United States are high, but the costs are relatively low. Sanctioning financial institutions in Myanmar will damage the junta’s ability to buy weapons overseas but will inflict only minimal harm on the broader population, which, following repeated crises, mostly steer clear of banks. These measures are also unlikely to drive Myanmar closer to China. The junta is already dependent on China, which will remain Myanmar’s biggest lender and export market. Sanctions cannot undo this close relationship, but along with targeted diplomatic efforts, they can raise the costs of the junta’s overreliance on Beijing and encourage its leaders to consider reforms that are more in line with U.S. interests.
Although Beijing has outcompeted Washington in Myanmar up to this point, the junta’s woefully incompetent management of its currency and foreign reserves presents an opportunity for the United States to recalibrate its approach to the country. The United States has the financial tools to hobble the junta, push back on China’s influence in the region, and improve the future for the people of Myanmar. If it fails to do so, it risks further empowering the junta and solidifying China’s powerful hold over the region. Such an outcome would be a moral and strategic disaster for the United States.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[After dominating politics in Republika Srpska for 27 years, Milorad Dodik is stepping down in the face of national court rulings and international pressure, paving the way for a presidential election on November 23.

Former President Milorad Dodik on Monday withdrew from all official roles in Republika Srpska, the Serb-majority entity that makes up half of Bosnia and Herzegovina, after almost three decades in power.
A months-long standoff with the state judiciary has thus ended with Dodik's complete capitulation.
It began in February, when a Bosnian federal court sentenced him to one year in prison and barred him from politics for six years for flouting decisions by High Representative Christian Schmidt, the international envoy tasked with enforcing the Dayton Agreement peace deal that ended the Bosnian War 30 years ago.

In August, Bosnia's Central Election Commission stripped Dodik of the presidency of Republika Srpska.
Initial defiance
"I won't step down. There will be a referendum at the end of September," Dodik repeatedly insisted, both after the court's decision and after being stripped of the presidency.
While he avoided a prison sentence by paying a fine, he is still barred from all political activity for six years.
But now, even the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD), the party Dodik has led for as long as he has been in power, has reversed its defiant stance.
After months of threatening secession in response to Dodik's conviction, the party has ultimately conceded.
Dodik has asked that the National Assembly of Republika Srpska appoint an interim president until a new one is elected in an early presidential election on November 23.

"This is part of our broader strategy — a move to resist threats aimed at undermining Republika Srpska," Dodik said on Monday.
Dodik's divided party
Despite stepping back, Dodik remains the head of the SNSD, his brainchild and the party that paved the way for his rise to political power.
But from once exercising near-total control over the entity of Republika Srpska, and even exerting major influence on national politics by either granting or withholding Republika Srpska's support for decisions at the Bosnian level, Dodik now finds himself reduced to leading a party that is fragmented by internal rifts.
Indeed, his withdrawal could mean the unraveling of the SNSD itself and with it, the fading legacy of what former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the West once described as a "breath of fresh air in the Balkans."

Rise and self-inflicted fall
Following the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement in 1995, Bosnia and Herzegovina was split into two highly autonomous entities: the predominantly Serb Republika Srpska and the predominantly Bosniak-Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.


Dodik rose to power in 1998 when he assumed the leadership of Republika Srpska, where he ruled unchallenged for most of the intervening period until his conviction earlier this year.
Ironically, it was Dodik himself who set recent events in motion by bringing a case to the Constitutional Court. He expected to be able to discredit the High Representative, Christian Schmidt, who had introduced legal reforms allowing elected politicians to be criminally prosecuted.
Instead, the result was a verdict that triggered a months-long — and ultimately futile — effort to cling to power.
Even the recurring threats of a referendum, which Dodik invoked more than 50 times to portray himself as the sole defender of Serb national unity, couldn't save him.


A devastated economy
More than two decades of unchecked corruption, cronyism, nepotism and patronage politics have devastated the economy of Republika Srpska.
Public utilities and industries have been hollowed out as a result of shady tenders, fake concessions and legal settlements.
Throughout his presidency, Dodik publicly championed Serb unity. He is pictured here with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic Image: Miomir Jakovljevic/Anadolu/picture alliance

The power distribution company of Republika Srpska was bankrupted in just a few years, and thermal power plants — once major exporters of energy — now teeter on the brink of collapse.
Champion of Serb unity?
While Dodik publicly championed Serb unity, the unity Dodik relied on ultimately served only the interests of his family and political circle.
His leadership delivered everything but the things Republika Srpska truly needed: economic growth, post-war recovery and reconciliation.
Weakening the central state and paving the way for Republika Srpska's potential future secession became a central aim of Dodik and the SNSD.
After the 1992-1995 Bosnian War, Republika Srpska had a population of nearly 1.5 million. Today, that number is estimated to have shrunk to barely 700,000.
Allies in Moscow, Budapest and Belgrade
Although he initially came to power with Western support, Dodik later pivoted to Moscow, forging strong ties with President Vladimir Putin. He also developed close links to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.
Dodik was convinced that Moscow would give its unwavering support if Republika Srpska's secession from Bosnia and Herzegovina ever became viable.

But no such support ever materialized — neither from the Kremlin nor from Budapest or Belgrade. In short, the much-anticipated Balkan political bloc never came about.
Relations with the High Representative 
Dodik's downfall can be traced back to a key court ruling in 2020 that assigned state property that had belonged to the government of the Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia before the 1992 war to the central government of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Dodik considered the ruling unacceptable because it challenged the notion of Republika Srpska having exclusive control over its territory.
A political clash followed with then-High Representative Valentin Inzko of Austria, who introduced a law criminalizing genocide denial. This was seen as a direct affront to Republika Srpska's leadership, which continues to deny the internationally recognized Srebrenica genocide.
Inzko was succeeded by Germany's Christian Schmidt, whom Dodik declared persona non grata for enforcing laws he saw as harmful to Republika Srpska. Dodik even ordered police to arrest Schmidt if he entered the entity — a threat that was never acted upon.
Ultimately, by stepping down and halting further confrontation with the international community and national institutions, Dodik has tacitly accepted both Schmidt's authority and the legitimacy of the Bosnian court that sentenced him.

 Zelenskyy says situation 'critical' at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant
    
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday described the situation at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as critical, blaming Russian shelling for preventing efforts to restore external power lines to the plant. 
In his nigthly video address, Zelenskyy said that one of the diesel generators providing emergency power was no longer functional, seven days after external power lines went down. 
"There has never before been such an emergency situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant. The situation is critical. Russian shelling has cut the plant off from the electricity network," Zelenskyy said.
The president also said he mentioned the issue in a discussion with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, saying he expected an "appropriate response" from the international community. 


Ukraine and Russia have traded blame for the longest outage at the nuclear power station since Russia seized control of the plant soon after its 2022 full-scale invasion. Russia attributed the power outage to Ukrainian shelling. 
Both sides have repeatedly accused each other of risking a potentially devastating nuclear disaster at Europe's largest atomic energy production facility during the course of the conflict.
Prior to the war, Zaporizhzhia NPP produced roughly 20% of Ukraine's energy supply.
It has been shut down since soon after Russia took control of the site, but it still needs power to maintain cooling and other security systems.

 Dnipro drone attack kills 1, injures 15
    
A drone strike in Dnipro killed one person and injured 15, 13 of whom required hospital treatment, regional governor Serhiy Lysak said. 
Videos circulating on social media showed a burning apartment building and several charred cars on a busy street in the city.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described it as a "brazen attack in broad daylight, targeting civilian infrastructure." 


Zelenskyy renewed his call for tougher international sanctions on Moscow, and for "all of us in Europe" to "build a reliable defense against Russian drones and missiles." 
Earlier, Ukrainian authorities said a total of 65 Russian drones targeted the country overnight, most of which were shot down by air defenses. 
A strike in the northeastern Sumy region killed a couple and their two children, according to the head of the regional military administration, Oleg Grygorov.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine had sent a team of anti-drone warfare specialists to Denmark "for exercises."
Copenhagen is preparing to host European leaders amid a series of alleged Russian airspace violations in Europe. 
Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk also said that Polish soldiers would head toDenmark to help secure the upcoming EU leaders' meeting and European Political Community summit. 
Mysterious drone sightings since September 22 have led to airport closures and other disruptions in Denmark, with Copenhagen blaming Moscow and Russia denying the allegations.

Poland has also recently reported a major drone incursion, while Russian neighbor Estonia said Russian fighter jets entered its airspace. 
Ukraine has faced almost nightly drone attacks from Russia since Moscow's full-scale invasion in early 2022; its Air Force says it intercepts roughly 80% of incoming drones. 
"Our group of specialists has begun deploying a mission in Denmark to share Ukraine's experience countering drones," Zelenskyy said in a social media post.
"Ukraine's experience is the most relevant in Europe today," he said. "And it is precisely our expertise, our specialists, and our technologies that can become a key element of future Europe's Drone Wall — a large-scale project that will guarantee security in the skies," he added.

 Hungary's Orban questions Ukrainian sovereignty amid drone dispute
    
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has claimed that Ukraine is not an independent country, given Russia occupying part of its territory and its reliance on western support in the war.
The comments, published as a transcript by Orban's populist government from an interview with a friendly media personallity, Balazs Nemeth, were made after Ukraine alleged that drones had entered its airspace from Hungary. 
Orban said he believed his ministers, who have denied that drones crossed into Ukraine's airspace, but he also tried to argue that it did not matter either way. 
"Let's assume some flew a few metres in. So what?" the prime minister said. "Ukraine should not behave as if it were a sovereign state. Ukraine lost a fifth of its territory in the war with the Russians, the Russians took it from them. Sovereignty has ended there." 
Orban, who has resisted several EU and NATO initiatives to support Ukraine or sanction Russia, said that if the West were to stop supporting Kyiv tomorrow, "Ukraine will close." 
He said that even though his government and that of Volodymyr Zelenskyy disagreed on several issues, "we are not enemies of each other." Therefore, he argued, Kyiv was focusing on the wrong issue because the drones would have posed no threat even if they did encroach on its airspace.
Hungary has secured exemptions to several EU sanctions programs on Russia, allowing it to continue importing much of its oil and gas from the country.
The arguments with Ukraine also come amid a heated election campaign in Hungary and a serious challenge to the government from a party now led by a former member of Orban's Fidesz party, Peter Magyar.

A Ukrainian diver wanted by Germany for his alleged involvement in the Nord Stream explosions has been detained in Poland, his lawyer and Polish prosecutors said on Tuesday. 
The man, identified by German authorities as Volodymyr Z., is suspected of involvement in the 2022 explosions that largely the severed Nord Stream gas pipelines running from Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
"This morning, he was detained in a town near Warsaw," the man's lawyer Tymoteusz Paprocki said, with Warsaw's regional prosecutor's office spokesperson later confirming the news. 
Paprocki said that his client would fight against his transfer to Germany, saying the European arrest warrant against him was inadmissible considering Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
"The attack on Nord Stream infrastructure concerns one of the pipeline's owners, [state-owned gas giant] Gazprom, which directly finances the military operations in Ukraine," he said. 
Paprocki said his clinet had done "nothing wrong" and had not committed "any crime to the detriment of Germany."

Last month, Italian police arrested another Ukrainian man, identified as Serhii K., suspected of coordinating the attacks. He too plans to appeal his extradition to Germany, after a lower court ordered his transfer.
The 2022 explosions disabled three out of four Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 pipelines. Russia blamed the US, Britain and Ukraine for the blasts. 
Germany, Denmark and Sweden all opened investigations into the incident, with the Danish and Swedish probes closing earlier this year without naming suspects.

 NATO boss Rutte: 'We have to keeps our skies safe'
    
Speaking alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels on Tuesday, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte proclaimed, "we have to keeps our skies safe."
Rutte's comments came ahead of an EU-NATO meeting to discuss air defense strategy in the face of perceived Russian threats.
"We have seen over the last couple of weeks what happened with the drones in Poland, the MiG-31s [fighter jets] in Estonia, but also what is happening now in Denmark," said Rutte.
"In Denmark, we are still assessing what is behind it, but when it comes to Poland and Estonia, it's clear that it's the Russians," he added. "Still, we are assessing whether it is intentional or not. But even if it is not intentional, it is reckless and it is unacceptable."
The frequency of such incidents along Europe's eastern border of late has prompted calls for the creation of a defensive drone wall, an idea that Rutte called "timely and necessary."
The concept will also be on the agenda when EU leaders gather for an informal summit in Copenhagen on Wednesday.
Von der Leyen on Tuesday said, "Europe must deliver a strong and united response to Russia's drone incursions at our borders," while pledging "immediate actions to create the drone wall."

 Loan to Ukraine from frozen Russian assets will fund EU defense — von der Leyen
    
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Tuesday that a reparation loan to Ukraine funded by frozen Russian assets would go partly toward funding the EU's defense industry.
Von der Leyen, however, clarified that the assets would not be seized.
"Importantly, there is no seizing of the assets. Ukraine has to repay the loan, if Russia is paying reparations. The perpetrator must be held responsible," she said.
Speaking as European Union (EU) commissioners met in Brussels for security talks, von der Leyen also stressed the need for a "drone wall" to guard against Russian drone incursions.
"Europe must deliver a strong and united response to Russia’s drone incursions at our borders," she said.
The commissioners are to be joined at their meeting by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.

 Ukrainian forces recapture territory in east — Zelenskyy
    
Recent Ukrainian counteroffensives have taken back more than 170 square kilometers (67 square miles) of territory from occupying Russian forces near the eastern town of Dobropillia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late on Monday.
"As of the beginning of this day, our forces have liberated more than 174 square kilometers since the start of the operation, and more than 194 square kilometers have been cleared of Russian sabotage groups," Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address.
He said nearly 3,200 Russian soldiers had been killed in the operations.
But Zelenskyy conceded that Kyiv's troops were embroiled in difficult situations at several places along the front, including near Kupiansk in the Kharkiv border region and in districts between Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk.

Ukraine says a Russian drone strike overnight to Tuesday killed a family of four in the northeastern Sumy region.
Oleg Grygorov, the head of the regional military administration, said a residential building in the village of Chernechchyna, in the Krasnopillia community, had been hit.
"A couple with two young children lived in this house. Unfortunately, no one managed to escape," Grygorov wrote on the Telegram messaging app.
"Rescuers [recovered] the bodies of four deceased people from under the rubble — parents and their sons, six and four years old," he said.
"This is a terrible and irreparable loss for the entire community and the region."
Russia in its turn said it had come under attack from Ukrainian drones overnight, with the Defense Ministry saying 81 had been "intercepted and destroyed."
On Sunday, a large-scale, 12-hour Russian drone and missile attack on Ukraine killed at least four people in the capital, Kyiv, including a 12-year-old girl, and injured dozens of more people across the country.

"We will enter into discussions with city districts with the goal of naming a prominent street or square after Helmut Kohl." This unadorned sentence appears in the coalition agreement that was signed by the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and center-left Social Democrats (SPD), who have been governing the city-state of Berlin since April 2023. However, the document does not provide any explanation for the shared intention.
Now, two and a half years later, Berlin's Mayor Kai Wegner (CDU) has officially announced the exact location in the German capital where Helmut Kohl (CDU), who served as the federal chancellor from 1982 to 1998, is to be honored: on the centrally located Hofjägerallee. "It is a big street for a mighty man to whom we owe a great deal," said Wegner, in explanation of the renaming process that is now underway.

Kohl, who died in 2017 at the age of 87, is considered the key architect of German reunification on October 3, 1990. Less than three weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, he presented his 10-point plan to the German Bundestag to reunite the country that had been divided into East and West since 1949. The majority of the German population shared in this desire. But in order to fulfill the plan, the victorious powers of World War II —the US, UK, France and the Soviet Union—also had to be convinced.
It didn't take long for Kohl, who held a doctorate in history, to overcome widespread reservations about reunification. His greatest achievement was securing the Kremlin's approval in personal talks with reformist communist Mikhail Gorbachev. This was a prerequisite for successful negotiations between the two German states and the Allies, who had forced Nazi Germany to surrender unconditionally in May 1945 after six years of war.
Known as the Two Plus Four Treaty, the agreement was signed in Moscow on September 12, 1990. Twenty-one days later, Germany celebrated its reunification. Berlin, divided by a wall since 1961, once again became the capital of Germany. And on the third anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Helmut Kohl was awarded honorary citizenship of Berlin for his accomplishments.

Helmut Kohl: From the province to the world stage

A tarnished reputation
However, Berlin still lacked a public display of appreciation for the politician. One of the main reasons for this may have been the dark shadow cast over Kohl's political career in 1999: revelations about the illegal CDU donations scandal, for which he himself was largely responsible. According to criminal investigations and media reports, the party had been keeping slush funds in Switzerland since at least the 1980s.
After initially denying the allegations, Kohl largely admitted to them and took political responsibility for the mistakes made in the CDU's finances during his term in office. He admitted to accepting what today would be the equivalent of €1.1 million ($1.3 million) in undisclosed and therefore illegal party donations that were not recorded in his party's accounts. The funds were paid in the form of the currency in use at the time, the German Mark (DM), before the changeover to the European single currency, the euro.
Although the names of numerous alleged donors were circulated, including private individuals and companies, Kohl himself remained silent on the matter until the end of his life. He said he had given them his word of honor not to reveal their names. But he said that he did not himself feel guilty of violating the law or the Constitution.
The CDU, which Kohl had chaired from 1973 to 1998, distanced itself from him. Two years later, he resigned from his position as honorary chairman. His political career ended in 2002 as a regular member of the Bundestag.


Kohl as Angela Merkel's mentor
The inglorious end of the era also marked the beginning of the rise of the next CDU Chancellor, Angela Merkel, Kohl's former protege. Merkel's term in office — from 2005 to 2021 — lasted just as long as that of her predecessor:  Sixteen years.
Then, four years after the death of her political mentor, Merkel stepped down from the political stage. And now, 35 years after German reunification, the time has come for a Helmut Kohl Avenue in Berlin.
Unlike in other cases, renaming the street should be easy because no one lives on the approximately 420-meter-long Hofjägerallee. This rules out any lawsuits, because according to a court ruling, this right is reserved exclusively for residents.

Within sight of the Victory Column and Brandenburg Gate
Whether Kohl would be satisfied with the location of the street that will be named after him remains a matter of speculation. One reason it would be is its location off the Großer Stern, the central square in Tiergarten. In the middle of the square stands the 67-meter-high 19th-century Victory Column, which is crowned by a gilded statue of Victoria.
It is one of Germany's most important national monuments and commemorates the so-called Wars of Unification, which led to the founding of the German Empire in 1871. All of this, it seems, would have suited Kohl, who was a great lover of history. And the four multi-lane roads leading away from the Victory Column have plenty of history to offer. This is especially true when looking east: This is where the Brandenburg Gate stands, the most important symbol of German reunification.
Anyone strolling a few hundred meters further south along the soon-to-be-named Helmut Kohl Avenue will come across international embassies as well as the CDU party headquarters, named after the first German Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer. Kohl would have likely been pleased by that, too.
Although the late chancellor of German reunification would have likely preferred that his name adorn the southern half of the street as well, since 1961, the street has been named after Gustav Klingelhöfer. And he, after all, was a Social Democrat.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Germany prides itself on its high animal welfare standards, enshrined as a national objective in its constitution since 2002. Yet animal welfare organizations fear the government is stepping back from its commitments.

A white-handed gibbon, native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia and critically endangered, typically sells for around €13,000 ($15,250) on the black market. One such gibbon, named "Jimmy," had spent months confined to a small cage and forced to wear a diaper. His planned handover was set to take place in a supermarket parking lot in Pforzheim, southern Germany. But instead of a buyer, the seller was met by police — tipped off by Jana Hoger, a PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) activist posing as a customer.
Hoger points to a troubling legal loophole.
"There's a thriving black market for trading protected species," she said. "Exotic animals are openly advertised in WhatsApp groups and at pet fairs — even those strictly protected in their countries of origin. Because Germany doesn't recognize their protected status, these animals can be sold legally here, despite having been smuggled out illegally in the first place."
October 4 is World Animal Day — and in 2025, Germany marks a special milestone: the 100th anniversary of its observance. This centennial brings renewed attention to cases like Jimmy's, the gibbon whose prolonged captivity led to severe behavioral disorders. Yet Jimmy's story is just one example.

The illegal trade in exotic animals such as monkeys, snakes and lizards continues to thrive. At the same time, the overwhelming demand for more familiar companions — Germany is home to more than 15 million cats and 10 million dogs — poses its own set of challenges, with consequences that extend far beyond the pet market.


Online trade in animals is booming
"Every month, an estimated 17,000 to 20,000 puppies appear on online platforms across Germany," Hoger told DW. "For dealers and criminal networks, it's a booming business. Many of these animals are bred under appalling conditions in eastern Europe and other regions before being transported here."
She adds that forged documents are now widespread, making it increasingly difficult for ordinary buyers to recognize when they're unknowingly participating in illegal trade.
Silvia Breher, Germany's newly appointed Federal Commissioner for Animal Welfare, has only been in office for five weeks — but the challenges ahead are already mounting. She recognizes the weight of her role, especially given that animal welfare has been enshrined in the German constitution since 2002.
In a statement to DW, Breher emphasized: "To protect our animal companions, we urgently need to ban public animal trading and anonymous online sales."
"We also urgently need to ease the strain on our overcrowded animal shelters," she went on to say.
Germany is home to roughly 1,400 animal shelters, many of which have been stretched to their limits since the COVID-19 pandemic. The new coalition government of the center-right Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union(CDU/CSU) and the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) had promised €80 million in support.
However, budgetary pressures appear to have reached animal welfare too: Not a single euro has been earmarked for shelters in the 2025 federal budget, says Lea Schmitz, spokesperson for the German Animal Welfare Federation.
"Most shelters are operating at full capacity and are in desperate need of funding," Schmitz told DW. "It's a dire situation, especially when there's nowhere else for these animals to go."

Criticism of Agriculture Minister Alois Rainer
Many animal welfare groups fear that Germany is backtracking on its commitments. Much of their criticism is aimed at the new Agriculture Minister, Alois Rainer, a CSU politician and trained butcher, whose ministry oversees animal welfare. Rainer recently stirred controversy by claiming there is no link between climate protection and meat consumption.
Silvia Breher's appointment as Animal Welfare Commissioner has also faced criticism, despite her having only recently taken office.
"Silvia Breher also serves as a Parliamentary State Secretary, representing the Federal Minister directly. That means she isn't independent, even though independence is a core requirement for the role of Animal Welfare Commissioner," Schmitz said. "As a CDU member of parliament, she votes on the very legislation she's expected to assess in her commissioner role."
On January 1, 2022, Germany became the first country in the world to ban the killing of male chicks — a landmark move championed by animal welfare organizations. However, advocates say that was just a starting point. To truly realize the constitutional promise of animal protection, they're now calling for broader reforms, such as mandatory neutering of stray cats, a ban on transporting animals to non-EU countries, and a drastic reduction in animal testing.

Conversion to organic farming is stalling
Julia Weibel, PETA's specialist for animals in the food industry, calls for a fundamental rethink of how farm animals are treated. She highlights disturbing breeding practices on some farms: "Holstein Friesian cows are bred to channel nearly all their energy into milk production, leaving their bodies severely emaciated. Piglets are engineered to gain at least 500 grams a day, with extra ribs bred in to maximize meat yield. Chickens grow at speeds that are entirely unnatural — and dangerously unhealthy."
Germany is working toward a target of 30% organic agriculture by 2030. However, by the end of 2024, it had only achieved 11.5%. The goal implies more humane animal husbandry, including more space in barns and pastures, and adequate outdoor access. Former Agriculture Minister Cem Özdemir of the Green Party had launched a funding program to support the transition to animal-friendly housing. But his successor, Rainer, is letting the program expire.
"If we were genuinely planning for future generations, we'd be cutting back on livestock numbers," Weibel said. "As the Agriculture Ministry's scientific advisory board recently recommended, meat and dairy alternatives should benefit from lower taxes and better market access to help make our diets more sustainable."

There are now almost daily attacks on critical infrastructure. In the same week that drones were spotted over several European airports, a cyberattack against security software used by many of those same hubs, including Berlin Airport, left passengers and personnel scrambling. At the same time, Germany's Deutsche Bahn rail service experienced the latest in a series of high-level sabotage incidents.
Similar cyberattacksare experienced by private companies with increasing regularity — costing the economy €289 billion ($339 billion), according to Bitkom, the umbrella organization for the digital economy in Germany. While about 68% of the time, the perpetrator is thought to be a crime syndicate, half of the survey companies said they could trace at least one attack to Russia. A similar number said they linked the incidents to China.

'The danger is increasing'
The Kremlin is also being blamed for the recent drone incursions across Europe.
"That it could be a private actor is extremely unlikely. These are professionals working with expensive equipment; it is highly likely to be a state actor," said Manuel Atug, an infrastructure security expert with the think tank AG Kritis.
Atug surmised that the purpose of the attacks, both physical and online, could be "destabilizing society from inside so that people lose trust in institutions and the government."
Earlier in September, Germany's domestic intelligence service, the BND, said that cyberattacks on government institutions and critical infrastructure occurred "almost daily." Chancellor Friedrich Merz admitted that "seldom in the country's post-war history has the security situation been this serious."
On Monday, Roderich Kiesewetter, a security specialist with Merz's center-right Christian Democrats (CDU), told the Handelsblatt newspaper that "the danger is increasing because Russia, in particular, is increasingly sending not only reconnaissance drones, but also armed drones." He warned that the government cannot afford to let private operators, such as airports, be solely responsible for such serious security issues and advocated for declaring a state of emergency, the basis for introducing special measures such as the reactivation of compulsory military service.
The German public is also sensing the growing threat. A study carried out by PWC earlier this year found that 67% of Germans are afraid of "hybrid attacks" from Russia, and nearly half felt that their government was ill-prepared to defend against them.
Indeed, Germany is infamously lagging behind in terms of digital infrastructure. Though the Bundeswehr is heavily staffed with IT experts, "tanks are running on software from 1989," Manuel Atug said, an example of how the German government is "rather weakly protected" against sophisticated cyberattacks.


Russia accused of hiring mercenary agents for attacks
Investigations are still ongoing after two crucial rail lines were sabotaged last week — the one between Hamburg and Berlin, and between Cologne and Düsseldorf. In one case, an explosive was detonated in a tunnel used by the train, and in another, the overhead electrical cables were cut. These were just two incidents in a string of what Deutsche Bahn has also called "nearly-daily attacks" beginning over the summer.
Lawmakers and investigators alike have asked if Russia could be behind the sabotage, as part of a multi-faceted attack on the lives of ordinary Germans Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt also spoke of alleged agents for hire, who aren't part of a foreign government, but will carry out cybercrime or physical attacks on infrastructure for one in exchange for money.
"Three of these so-called low-level agents are currently facing charges in Munich," he said, accused of planning train sabotage on behalf of Moscow.

Left-wing extremists blamed for further rail sabotage
Some politicians have also blamed left-wing extremists for train damage, including the state interior minister for North Rhine-Westphalia, Herbert Reul. An open letter was published on a left-wing website, taking credit for August attack on the line between the cites of Duisburg and Düsseldorf.
"It is therefore likely that militant left-wing extremists were responsible," Reul said.
As to what motive left-wing extremists might have to attack railway lines, considering supporting public transportation is usually a leftist cause, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution says that Deutsche Bahn is not seen as merely a public good in the far-left scene.
"Deutsche Bahn is denounced by the scene as the largest logistics company in the 'capitalist profit economy'" in Germany.
Security expert Manuel Atug pointed out that "anyone can publish an anonymous letter on that platform. It is unusual that no other leftists or groups expressed solidarity with it."
"It wouldn't be the first time leftists blocked transportation," he said, but, authorities should "conduct a proper investigation first" rather than announcing suspicions and going from there. He said this was also true for the drone incursions and cyberattacks.
Opposition lawmakers are calling on Merz's government to take consequential action and to be clear about where the threats were coming from, rather than announcing suspicions without any follow-up. As Konstantin Notz, who handles security policy for the Greens, told Deutschlandfunk radio: "The German public has a right to be clearly informed about where attacks are taking place on a daily or weekly basis, what is suspected, and who is behind them."

Halfway through Oktoberfest, which runs this year from September 20 to October 5 in Munich, questions on crowd control are now arising following the closure of the festival grounds' entrances for around 30 minutes on Saturday.
A loudspeaker announcement in German urged visitors to leave the festival without any explanation, leading to additional confusion.
Some visitors later complained on social media about how they felt trapped in the crowd. "It was close to mass panic," one woman wrote on Instagram, saying she feared being "trampled to death and knocked over." Another described the situation as "extremely dangerous," with people screaming and crying. 
Many Oktoberfest visitors reported bottlenecks. As this TikTok video shows, many people stuck on the site could not even move in one direction or the other:


Two visitors had to be treated for panic attacks, but there were no injuries, according to reports.
"It wasn't foreseeable that it would all fill up so quickly," explained event manager Christian Scharpf. 


What was behind the surge of visitors and temporary closure?
Tents at Oktoberfest — or on the Wiesn, as the festival is locally known — operate in two shifts; the day shift and the evening shift. The switch usually takes place at 5 p.m. The bottlenecks were caused by too many people trying to enter and exit the tents at the same time.
According to a Munich city spokeswoman, at around 5 p.m. there were some 300,000 visitors on the Theresienwiese festival grounds. 
That's why the entrances were temporarily closed, until visitors who were already on site had found their new spots in the tents. Subways coming from the city center didn't stop at the Theresienwiese station during the closure, and the police made an announcement on social media: "Please avoid visiting Oktoberfest at this time."
The incident is unusual, but not unprecedented, explained the Munich spokeswoman, who said that there have been several occasions in the past when the grounds had to be closed temporarily.

Less beer and more water at Oktoberfest
Having reached its halfway point, Oktoberfest has also released data on this year's attendance and sales. 
Despite the overcrowding, the number of visitors is slightly down compared to the turnout for the same period last year. Festival organizers estimate that, as of last Sunday, around 3.5 million visitors had so far visited Oktoberfest. Last year, that figure was 3.6 million.
Beer consumption, too, has so far been below last year's level. Perhaps no wonder, since a Mass (a 1-liter mug) costs between €14.50 and €15.80 ($17.20 - $18.60) at the Wiesn this year. Only a few venues are offering them for less than €15.
On the other hand, significantly more non-alcoholic beverages were consumed — especially water; about 10% more than in 2024. Water was even sold out at some stands. Organizers suspect that this is due to the warm weather, with temperatures reaching 30.7 degrees Celsius (87.2°F) on the first weekend of the festival — Oktoberfest's highest since records began in 1879.

More crimes reported
By the weekend, Munich police had reported 414 crimes — compared to 317 for the same period last year, and 479 in 2023. So far, officers have responded to 833 incidents, which is fewer than in 2024, with 901 incidents. Many of those were reports of physical assault, disorderly conduct or disputes.
The number of sexual offenses is on par with previous years, with 33 reports so far. The majority of these cases involve sexual harassment or secretly taking photographs up women's skirts — what's known as upskirting.
According to the organizers, a clear hit song at this year's Wiesn hasn't emerged yet, but "Wackelkontakt" by Bavarian singer Oimara is being played very frequently in the festival tents. The most popular line to sing along to translates to "If I were a piece of furniture, I'd be a lamp from the 70s."

Afghanistan producer




Published
30 September 2025




Fahima Noori had big dreams when she graduated from university in Afghanistan. 
She had studied law, graduated from a midwifery programme and even worked in a mental health clinic.
But all that was taken away when the Taliban swept into power in 2021. They banned girls over the age of 12 from getting an education, severely restricted job options for women and recently removed books written by women from universities.
For Fahima, the internet was her last lifeline to the outside world. 
"I recently enrolled in an online university [and] I had hoped to finish my studies and find an online job," she said. 
On Tuesday, that lifeline was cut off when the Taliban imposed a nationwide internet shutdown that is set to last indefinitely. 
"Our last hope was online learning. Now [even] that dream has been destroyed," said Fahima.
Her real name has been changed to protect her identity, as have the names of all others interviewed for this article.


'We all sit at home doing nothing'


Over the past few weeks, the Taliban government began severing fibre-optic internet connections across several provinces, saying this was part of an effort to prevent immorality. 
For many, they feared this might be the first step towards an entire internet shutdown.
And on Tuesday, their worst fears came true. The country is currently experiencing a "total internet blackout" according to internet watchdog Netblocks - a move that has paralysed the country's essential services. 
International news agencies say they have lost contact with offices in the capital Kabul. Mobile internet and satellite TV has also been severely disrupted across Afghanistan. Flights from Kabul airport have also been disrupted, according to local media reports.


Flights in Afghanistan grounded after internet shutdown


Ahead of the nationwide shutdown, the BBC spoke to some people in Afghanistan who detailed how the internet outages in their provinces had derailed their lives.
"Before this, I studied midwifery, but unfortunately that programme was banned for women... the only hope left for us was the internet and online learning," said Shakiba, who lives in the northern province of Tahkar. 
"We want to study. We want to be educated. We want to be able to help people in our future. When I heard that the internet had been cut, the world felt dark to me."
It's a similar tale for Fahima, who says she now feels "helpless".
"My two sisters [and I] were studying online. We used to stay updated on news and technology through the internet, but now we cannot keep up or learn new skills," said the student, who lives in an eastern province of Afghanistan. 
"We dreamed of finishing our education and helping our father financially, but now... we all sit at home doing nothing."
Since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban have imposed numerous restrictions in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.
Earlier this month they removed books written by women from the country's university teaching system as part of a new ban which has also outlawed the teaching of human rights and sexual harassment.
Around 140 books by women - including titles like "Safety in the Chemical Laboratory" - were found to be of "concern" due to "anti-Sharia and Taliban policies", said the Taliban. 
The Taliban government has said it respects women's rights in accordance with their interpretation of Afghan culture and Islamic law.

But it's not just female students that have been affected - teachers like Zabi, who used to make a living through online teaching, have been similarly hit by the ban.
Zabi says he had previously worked as a journalist in Pakistan, but found no opportunities in the field when he returned to Afghanistan. He decided to open an English teaching centre - but was forced to take this online when authorities imposed restrictions on educational institutes, he says.
"I had men and women in my classes - up to 70 or 80 students at a time. My students were happy and our lessons went smoothly," he said. "They were all preparing for the IELTS [a standardised English test] and all their learning depended on the internet. The research, the practice tests, the official exams, everything."
Zabi, who also lives in the east of the country, adds that there is no IELTS centre in Afghanistan, so the only option for students is to take one online. 
"Two days ago, about 45 of my students were in the middle of an exam when the internet was cut off. They had been preparing for it for months, but they missed the opportunity. It was heartbreaking for them - and for me as their teacher."
He adds that he constantly gets calls from his students who don't know what to do. 
"They keep calling me asking 'Teacher, what should we do?' For the boys, there are still some English  centres open, but for my female students, this was their last chance. And now even that is gone."
Prior to Monday's shutdown, many of the interviewees say that there is still the option of being connected to mobile data - but that this is far too expensive for most, and that connectivity is patchy. A monthly plan with 100GB of data costs 3,500 Afghani, or around $50 (£37). In contrast, Wifi used to cost around 1,000 Afghani a month - which could be further split between a few students. 
According to an earlier UNDP report, Afghanistan's per capita income stood at $306 in 2024. 
Zabi says he will need to leave the country if the internet is not restored soon - saying he has no other way of earning a living. 
The Taliban have yet to give an official reason for the shutdown. They had earlier said an alternative route for internet access would be created, but did not give any more details. 
Anas, a money changer in Takhar province, says his business has faced "enormous problems" since the internet shutdown, saying that much of his work depends on the internet. 
"Our business has been affected by about 90%," he says. "Yesterday, my brother who is also my business partner tried to send an email to a client. He couldn't get it through."
But his main concern are his three daughters - all of whom used to take online classes. 
"The night before, we heard the Taliban had cut internet access in Mazar, and my eldest daughter came to me with tears in her eyes and said she feared the same would happen here. 
"Their last opportunity to study is now gone. Seeing my children so helpless... [that was] the hardest for me. Only God knows what will happen to them and to me."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[At a two-day closed-door meeting, Chancellor Friedrich Merz's Cabinet is set to discuss further political plans. However, the atmosphere is expected to be tense.
    The German government is set for two days of teambuilding Image: Liesa Johannssen/REUTERS   
Only four months after the government took office, satisfaction with the ruling coalition of the center-right Christian Democrats and Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and center-left Social Democrats (SPD) has fallen to a record low: In a monthly opinion poll, only 22% of eligible voters said they were satisfied with Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government.
The Cabinet ministers are now meeting for a closed-door session at Villa Borsig in Berlin to talk about several hot potato issues.
Germany's strained national budget
When it comes to fiscal policy, there are a whole host of contentious issues, beginning with the national budget. Merz alienated many of his voters when he quickly relaxed the "debt brake" that limited fresh borrowing to 0.35% of gross domestic product (GDP), which he had vowed to uphold throughout his election campaign.
Now, enormous credit-financed sums are available for investment in infrastructure and defense. Yet this came at the expense of Merz's credibility with his voters, and it means that the government faces rising interest payments.
Consequently, the CDU and CSU are pushing for austerity, while the SPD is primarily focused on increasing revenue — i.e., raising taxes.

Taxes up or down?
Which brings us to a classic point of contention between the CDU/CSU and the Social Democrats: The SPD is in favor of higher taxation on large wealth, inheritances and income to generate more revenue for the state and for social justice reasons.
The CDU and CSU oppose nearly all tax increases, arguing that they are detrimental to the economy.
Some conservative politicians have recently indicated a willingness to make concessions on the inheritance tax. This may signal the possibility of a tradeoff, with the SPD accommodating the CDU/CSU on other issues, such as "citizen's income."
Citizen's income to be renamed
The CDU and CSU are already taking issue with the name of the welfare payments. "Citizen's income" is the term introduced in 2023 under the previous SPD-led federal government for basic income support for jobseekers.
According to the conservative parties, the term resembles "basic income" and suggests that everyone is entitled to state support. They argue that there is too little pressure on the long-term unemployed to accept offered work.

In July 2025, about 5.4 million people in Germany received citizen's income. Of these, around 3.9 million were classified as able to work.
The CDU/CSU points out that almost half of the recipients are foreign citizens, such as Ukrainian war refugees and argues that Germany's welfare system encourages immigration.
The SPD does not believe that there is systematic abuse of the support and rejects severe cuts or the introduction of restrictions.
Both sides agree that organized fraud involving citizen's income, numerous suspected cases of which have been reported by the Federal Employment Agency, should be combated.
Germany's social security system under pressure
All parties agree that an ageing population with increasing numbers of retirees must force changes to the pension system. Here, too, the CDU/CSU tends to favor adjustments to the pension system, such as raising the retirement age. Many CDU lawmakers are pushing for more radical pension reforms so that the burden on young people will be less severe in the future.
The SPD tends to favor safeguarding good pensions. Labor Minister and SPD co-chair Bärbel Bas argues that most people rely on the statutory pension, which means that they do not have to rely on support from their children to avert old-age poverty.
The CSU has insisted that mothers whose children were born before 1992 should see a slight rise in their pensions, although this will place a €5 billion burden on the budget.
Not only are particularly heated disagreements still expected within the coalition on pensions, but also on health insurance and long-term care, which are under similar demographic pressure.

How migration to Germany changed after 2015 refugee arrivals

Doomed to success in curbing immigration to Germany
German borders are now being closed, and people are being turned away. CSU Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt said this had led to a sharp decline in "illegal immigration."
The SPD has supported a stricter immigration policy, albeit with significant reservations.
The Social Democrats were quick to reject an initiative by Bavarian State Premier Markus Söder to cut welfare payments to all refugees from Ukraine and pay them only the minimum amount of benefits for asylum applicants.
There is a lot of pressure to overcome the differences between the CDU/CSU and the SPD on immigration in the face of the mounting strength of the far-right anti-immigration party Alternative for Germany.


Conscription or voluntary service?
The coalition partners want to strengthen the German armed forces and inject much more money into the military.
Their views diverge when it comes to conscription. This summer, the Cabinet introduced a draft bill for a new military service. The draft introduces a military registration system for young men, which will initially be a voluntary service.
"If, despite all efforts, the demand cannot be met by volunteers, we are prepared," SPD Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said recently. "Compulsory conscription will then have to happen." This view is shared by numerous politicians from the CDU and CSU, who want to see conscription if not enough volunteers can be found.
Pistorius, however, is at odds with his own party, which passed a resolution against conscription at its federal party conference in June. This is another issue that is likely to be hotly contested.

Chancellor Merz delivers 'symbolically charged speech'

Mistrust following failed election of a judge
Three new judges — two women and one man — have now been elected to the Federal Constitutional Court by the Bundestag , Germany's lower house of parliament, with the necessary two-thirds majority, but only on the second attempt.
The election failed at the last minute in July, right before the summer recess, after reservations were voiced in the CDU/CSU parliamentary group about the SPD's nominee, Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf.
This led to mistrust and doubts over whether the coalition was able to work together.
This harked back to events in May, when Friedrich Merz needed an unprecedented second round of voting in the Bundestag to become chancellor. This was because of dissenters within the ruling parties' own ranks in the first round of voting, which created a negative atmosphere from the outset.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the government partners will undergo what has been billed as a team-building exercise at Villa Borsig in Berlin. The retreat, being held in the villa of former industrialist Ernst von Borsig, symbolizes the government's willingness to prioritize economic competitiveness and state modernization.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[When U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House, he had his sights set on rebalancing the transatlantic relationship. He would be right to do so. The United States’ burden in NATO is out of proportion with the interests at stake, and regulations set in Brussels have resulted in a lopsided U.S.-EU trade regime. Although it is one of 32 NATO members, the United States covers 16 percent of NATO’s annual budget and shoulders most of the operational and logistical burden for Europe’s security. Meanwhile, the EU has long used tariff and nontariff barriers to limit access for U.S. agricultural and industrial products and has obstructed the operation of American small business and Big Tech with rules and red tape.
Trump took aim at Europe as soon as he entered office. Shortly after his inauguration, he dispatched Vice President JD Vance and the freshly confirmed U.S. defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, to warn Europeans that Washington’s “new sheriff” was intent on changing the terms of the relationship. In Paris, Vance called on Europe to lower regulation of artificial intelligence and energy. In Munich, he questioned Europe’s continued commitment to shared Western values. In Brussels, Hegseth announced that the United States could no longer focus primarily on Europe’s security and would be shifting to other priorities. Soon after, Trump levied punitive tariffs designed to pressure Europe to reduce trade barriers and regulations that limit the access of U.S. firms.
This multifront pressure campaign produced some initial results. At a NATO summit meeting in June, European allies promised to increase their defense spending to five percent of GDP by 2035. In July, Trump and the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced a trade deal committing the EU to purchase $750 billion in American energy products and invest $600 billion in the U.S. market by 2028.
Yet these successes were at best partial, and perhaps illusory. The five percent pledge by European allies does almost nothing for the United States in the near term, and since today’s leaders cannot credibly bind the hands of future ones, it is an open question whether European countries will ever meet these spending targets. Moreover, the United States has retained control of key leadership positions in NATO, ensuring that Europe’s institutionalized military dependence will endure.
The trade deal with the EU, formalized as a framework agreement in August, could represent a more substantial adjustment. But for now, it remains an outline. Europe’s ability to meet its multiyear commitments is far from clear, and Brussels continues to resist revising regulations that inhibit the operation of American high-tech companies on the continent. The trade pact is also a one-off, unsupported by any institutional infrastructure. As a result, the impenetrability of EU bureaucracies will continue to limit the United States’ ability to restructure transatlantic economic relations.


If the Trump administration truly intends to rebalance the relationship with Europe—and to assign it a more proportionate place within American foreign policy—it cannot rely on narrow deals that merely tweak or seek to circumvent existing structures. Instead, it must tackle the basic premises of transatlanticism head on. To do so requires an understanding of the three fateful choices made at NATO’s founding: prioritizing Europe at the expense of the Americas, institutionalizing the military rather than the economic component of the transatlantic relationship, and embedding a regional alliance within a universalist ideological framework. Each decision came with immediately apparent downsides. All have resulted in mounting difficulties in recent years. Until the original premises of transatlantic policy are reconsidered, the relationship will continue to suffer from the same fundamental problems.
Fortunately, the Trump administration can take steps to address past mistakes and set the transatlantic relationship on a new course. First, Trump should follow through on his commitment to refocus U.S. foreign policy on America’s near abroad, pulling back from Europe and avoiding the hard “pivot to Asia” that previous administrations have pledged. Second, his national security team should insist that NATO confine its activities to the Euro-Atlantic region. Finally, the Trump administration should shift the transatlantic relationship from one based on military cooperation to one centered on economic engagement and technology. The continent would remain an important American partner, but it would no longer be a drain on American resources.
THE POSTWAR PIVOT
For the first century and a half of its history, the United States prioritized a hemispheric foreign policy. In his 1796 Farewell Address, George Washington warned Americans against entanglement with Europe. In his 1823 address to Congress, James Monroe warned Europeans against encroachment into the Western Hemisphere. U.S. efforts to institutionalize a pan-American policy reached their apogee in 1947 with the adoption of the Rio Pact—the first mutual security treaty to be joined by the United States—in which the region’s countries agreed to defend one another if attacked.
When the United States joined NATO in 1949, American policymakers pointed to the Rio Pact as a precedent and drew analogies between the alliance’s founding document, the North Atlantic Treaty, and the Monroe Doctrine. NATO had obvious appeal at the time. Europe, the world’s richest region, had been devastated by war and could be incorporated into the U.S. sphere comparatively cheaply. American officials were also concerned that if the United States did not gain a foothold in Europe, it would cede ground in the region to the Soviet Union, its strongest competitor.
But the postwar pivot to Europe proved to be a rejection, rather than an extension, of the United States’ traditional hemispheric policy and came at a clear cost to U.S. interests in the Americas. Over the course of the Cold War, Washington abandoned or ignored previous positive projects in Latin America in favor of a reactive (and ineffective) policy of anticommunist intervention. Rare attempts to revitalize U.S. efforts in the region, such as President John F. Kennedy’s Alliance for Progress, an aid program in Latin America, ultimately failed to attract sufficient resources and devolved into further support for whatever local security forces claimed to be combating communism.
When American ambition (and NATO) expanded after the Cold War’s end, attention to the Western Hemisphere dwindled further. Security at the southern border of the United States became a major domestic concern as powerful cartels entrenched themselves in Mexico and Central America. The United States remained at odds with Cuba—a former ally of the now defunct Soviet Union and the keystone of the Caribbean, only 100 miles off the Florida coast—and, after the election of Hugo Chavez in 1998, lost constructive relations with Venezuela, which possesses the world’s largest proven oil reserves. Meanwhile, investment opportunities throughout the region have increasingly gone to non-U.S. companies.
BOOTS ON THE GROUND
When the United States shifted its attention across the Atlantic in the early postwar period, its priority was economic engagement—both to create export markets for American companies and to inoculate the European continent against communism. The Marshall Plan, announced in 1947, translated this priority into policy: providing billions in aid to support economic rebuilding and stabilization across the continent, encouraging the adoption of American industrial standards, and reducing trade barriers. Yet the project was short-lived, and Washington soon passed the baton of economic integration to the Europeans themselves. When the Marshall Plan ended in 1951, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands created the European Coal and Steel Community, planting the seeds for the development of an economic union with the power to exclude America from the market it had helped to create.


Whereas European reconstruction and economic integration was an American initiative that the Europeans later pursued on their own, mutual security began as a European concern before becoming a permanent American burden. In 1947, the United Kingdom and France signed the Dunkirk Treaty, providing for their mutual defense. In 1948, they were joined by Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands in signing the Brussels Treaty. In 1949, the United States signed the North Atlantic Treaty, accepting what became a long-term role in western European security.
Even then, many in the United States did not think it needed to indefinitely protect western Europe. George Kennan, the American diplomat and architect of containment, was initially skeptical of the need for a transatlantic alliance. He believed that the western Europeans’ focus on military security resulted from “their failure to understand correctly their own position” and from misjudging the primarily political nature of the communist threat. As far as Kennan was concerned, American accession to the North Atlantic Treaty was a psychological salve to “stiffen the self-confidence” of the western Europeans so that they could turn their attention to the real priorities of economic reconstruction and political stabilization.

 The transatlantic relationship has endured as a purely military arrangement.
Four decades later, the Soviet bloc collapsed, and Russian soldiers retreated. Yet American forces remained, and NATO not only endured but also expanded—over the objections of Kennan and others. The persistence of this military alliance can best be explained by a lack of alternative Atlanticist structures. North America and Europe are bound by no institution aside from NATO. For former members of the Warsaw Pact and for the new post-Soviet states, NATO membership was the only ticket into the American club and the security and economic benefits it offered. For Washington, NATO’s continued existence was the simplest way to secure and expand the United States’ sphere of influence.
Yet, as many observers predicted, attempts to extend transatlantic cohesion through NATO expansion ultimately provoked a Russian reaction that a transatlantic relationship premised on economic cooperation might not have had. A 2008 NATO summit declaration in Budapest promising future membership for Georgia and Ukraine was followed by wars in both countries.
At the same time, the creation of the European Union in 1993 exacerbated the tensions within the transatlantic alliance. While the United States has paid the costs—and assumed the risks—of an ever-growing security sphere, it has had no formal say in the political, legal, and economic structures of Europe. This has benefited Brussels and Berlin at Washington’s expense. The transatlantic relationship, created to extend American economic leverage in Europe, has endured as a purely military arrangement.
NATO GOES GLOBAL
The U.S. postwar focus on Europe was initially driven by regional interests, but American foreign policy quickly took on a global orientation. Before the United States even joined NATO, U.S. decision-makers considered creating a worldwide anticommunist alliance. On March 23, 1948, officials from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada met secretly to explore the possibility of a worldwide “pact of the free nations” under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Although they decided against pursuing this option in the short term, they “agreed that any approach adopted should not prejudice an ultimate development in this direction.”
American policymakers continued to push for a globally interconnected security system even as they committed the United States to a regional transatlantic alliance. Senator Warren Magnuson, for example, a Democrat from Washington State, combined a vote for the North Atlantic Treaty with a call for “a similar pact for the Pacific.” “If we are going to assume the leadership of all the free peoples of the world, and of those who would be free,” he explained, “of course we cannot limit the work we are undertaking to do to one geographical area of the world.”
Kennan, by contrast, emphasized the steep costs of continuing to expand American security commitments: “Beyond the Atlantic area, which is a clean-cut concept, and which embraces a real community of defense interest firmly rooted in geography and tradition, there is no logical stopping point in the development of a system of anti-Russian alliances until that system has circled the globe,” he wrote in a memo that year. Such a policy, he continued, could “lead only to one of two results; either all these alliances become meaningless declarations . . . or this country becomes still further over-extended, politically and militarily.”


Despite Kennan’s advice, American commitments continued to proliferate. In 1950, NSC-68—a National Security Council report viewed as the seminal strategic document of the Cold War—defined the United States’ overarching aim as the buildup of “the political, economic, and military strength of the free world,” a concept American policymakers identified with the entire noncommunist world. In the first half of the 1950s, NATO membership was extended to include Greece, Turkey, and West Germany. Over that period, Washington rimmed the periphery of the “communist world” with three more “free world” alliances: ANZUS (Australia, New Zealand, and the United States), SEATO (Australia, France, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States), and CENTO (an alliance between Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, which the United States orchestrated without joining).
When the Soviet Union collapsed, Atlanticists assumed that liberal democracy would naturally extend to the ends of the earth. When this didn’t materialize, they blamed various bad actors, from terrorists to totalitarians. The Biden administration completed the reversion to a Cold War frame, declaring a global divide between democracies and autocracies, with China and Russia reprising their roles as principal foes. And once again, the transatlantic relationship was instrumentalized to serve the interests of the larger “liberal order”: NATO members were encouraged to increase their military cooperation with allies in East Asia, while Japan and South Korea attended NATO summits and were vocal in their support for Ukraine. Even after Trump’s reelection, European officials have continued to invoke linkages between China and Russia in an effort to maintain American military engagement on the continent.
RIGHTING THE WRONGS
The Trump administration’s approach to Europe so far has not been sufficient to dislodge the foundations of the transatlantic relationship as it has stood for 75 years. But the good news for Trump is that he still has over three years to push the United States toward a foreign policy that truly puts U.S. interests first.
To start, the Trump administration should regionalize the transatlantic relationship, turning its focus back to Europe and the North Atlantic, where it should have been along. Trump and his national security team have stopped talking about the “latticework” that ties Washington’s European and Asian allies together and no longer promote NATO as a core building block of any sort of liberal international order. They have also urged NATO members to focus on security issues in their own backyards over those in the Indo-Pacific. But Trump will need to do more to keep the U.S.-European relationship regionally contained, especially in the defense domain.
To ensure that the scope of the transatlantic commitment—and NATO’s remit—does not expand further, the United States should begin discussions to formally close the alliance’s open door, foreclosing the chance for future expansion. The United States should also make sure that the alliance’s activities remain squarely focused on Europe. Washington should insist that NATO planning documents focus only on Euro-Atlantic security challenges, including direct threats to NATO territory, maritime security in waters surrounding the continent, and cyberthreats from state and nonstate actors. The United States should also withhold support for any operations outside NATO’s current boundaries suggested by other members of the alliance, including naval transits of the Taiwan Strait and no-fly zones over Ukraine.

 The United States should focus on technology and economic cooperation with Europe.
Second, Trump will need to force Europe to assume more responsibility for its own defense—and not just on paper. This might not require a U.S. withdrawal from NATO, but it will demand significant retrenchment of U.S. forces and a literal interpretation of the alliance’s cornerstone document, Article 5, to narrow the scope of the U.S. military commitment to Europe in a crisis. Although Article 5 is often described as requiring member states to deploy troops to provide direct support if any other member is a victim of aggression, the actual commitment is more limited. The treaty states only that in the event of an attack, members “will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.” The United States could meet this standard by offering military assistance or logistical support, for example, rather than putting U.S. soldiers on the frontline.
Especially important will be the withdrawal of ground combat and air forces based in Germany, Poland, and Romania, which represent the core of the U.S. military commitment in the region. Removing most of these forces will make it easier for Washington to keep any U.S. role in future European conflicts limited by reducing both the risk of entanglement and the temptation U.S. policymakers might feel to support direct involvement. Institutional changes will also be needed. The Trump administration should begin talks with NATO allies to ensure that Europeans rather than Americans can fill top civilian and military posts, including the position of the next supreme allied commander of NATO. And it should rewrite NATO plans to reduce the U.S. forward defense and frontline role and instead assign U.S. forces in Europe to support functions, including intelligence, logistics, and other strategic enablers.
After downsizing its military footprint in Europe, the United States should work to build a new bedrock for transatlantic ties focused on technology and economic cooperation. This project will require new institutions to formalize engagement and strengthen partnerships in areas including AI, pharmaceuticals, and critical minerals. U.S. leadership in the space and cybertechnology fields could also be reinforced through cooperation with Europe. The new trade deal that Trump recently closed with the EU could be the starting point for building new cooperative mechanisms and mutually beneficial ties. Progress on issues such as requirements for technology transfers and sharing and the harmonization of regulatory standards should be areas of particular focus.


Finally, the Trump administration should not repeat the mistakes of 1949 by using the retrenchment to do a hard pivot to Asia, complete with the construction of new collective security organizations, an expanded military footprint, and efforts to build a global coalition to contain a feared adversary (this time, China). Such a move is widely advocated by U.S. foreign policy experts and China hawks, but it would once again leave the United States overextended and risk drawing the country into conflict far from its own shores. In any case, the current U.S. military presence in Asia is more than sufficient to secure U.S. interests.
THE PIVOT HOME
The United States should instead pivot home. Trump should take the resources and strategic bandwidth freed by a smaller U.S. military role in Europe and refocus U.S. energy in the Western Hemisphere. Border and port security and air and missile defense of the homeland are areas in which military power will be essential. But even after investment in these areas, the reduction in U.S. military commitments in Europe will allow the United States to get leaner, creating budget space for domestic priorities, including infrastructure, education, and paying down the national debt.
The Trump administration should work with regional partners to address the root causes of migration and allocate more resources to the law enforcement agencies best trained to deal with issues such as human and drug trafficking and transnational organized crime. Washington can also focus on increasing its investment across Latin America, both to take advantage of the region’s abundant natural resources and to build stronger ties with U.S. neighbors—including those with which the United States has a history of conflict. Washington could include Greenland, which is part of North America, in its new hemispheric policy, finding mutually beneficial areas for cooperation, from extracting critical minerals to setting up new military operating locations to reinforce security in the northern Atlantic.
Although this pivot home will not be complete in four years, the Trump administration has a unique opportunity to rebalance the transatlantic relationship and cure its pathologies. When this rebalancing is accomplished, it will be an enduring achievement that will position the United States for the challenges and opportunities of the next 75 years.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[在赛格广场外，一名骑电动车的外卖骑手将餐食交给一位代送跑腿员，由他送到大楼里下单的顾客手中。 


SEG Plaza, one of the tallest skyscrapers in Shenzhen, China, has about 70 stories and thousands of tenants. During the lunch rush, the wait for an elevator can stretch to half an hour — a nightmare for a food-delivery driver trying to fill as many orders as possible.


赛格广场是中国深圳最高的摩天大楼之一，有大约70层，入驻了数千租户。在午餐高峰期，等电梯的时间可能长达半小时——这对试图完成尽可能多订单的外卖骑手来说简直就是噩梦。



The solution? People like 16-year-old Li Linxing.


解决方案？像16岁的李林星（音）这样的人。



As lunchtime approaches on a Monday in August, he positions himself near the building’s entrance, eyes scanning the surrounding streets. When a delivery driver appears, Linxing thrust his hand into the air and shouts: “Delivery stand-in!”


8月的一个周一，当午餐时间临近时，他来到大楼入口附近，目光扫视着周围的街道。当一名外卖员出现时，李林星高举手臂大喊：“代送！”



The driver, still straddling an electric scooter, hands an insulated takeout bag to Linxing, tells him which floor it goes to and scans the QR code that Linxing wears printed on a card hanging around his neck, to pay him 2 Chinese yuan, about 28 cents. The whole operation takes mere seconds. And then the driver speeds off to the next destination.


仍跨坐在电动摩托车上的骑手将一个外卖保温袋递给李林星，告诉他要送达的楼层，并扫描李林星挂在脖子上的二维码卡片，向他支付2元人民币的报酬。整个过程仅用了几秒。随后，骑手便飞速驶向下一个目的地。





The last leg of the journey is up to Linxing. He squeezes into the elevator lobby with dozens of other people — many of them fellow delivery runners — to go up to wherever his hungry office worker awaits. Then it is back downstairs and repeat for the rest of the day, from lunchtime through the afternoon and into dinner, until around 8 p.m.


最后这段路就交给李林星了。他挤进电梯间，和其他几十人——其中许多是代跑腿的同行——一同乘电梯上楼，去往饥肠辘辘的上班族所在之处。然后，他再下楼，重复这样的劳动，从午餐时段一直到下午，再到晚餐，直到晚上8点左右。



This logistical feat, a gig economy within a gig economy, is another example of the entrepreneurial spirit of Shenzhen, a city of about 18 million in southern China that pioneered the country’s embrace of a market economy. None of the dozens of last-mile delivery workers who mill outside SEG Plaza every day has a formal contract. Most are retirees, although during the summer, teenagers like Linxing appear, too. Some are there out of financial necessity, others for fun or exercise.


这种物流协调上的成就，即一种“零工经济中的零工经济”，是深圳创业精神的又一例证。这座拥有约1800万人口的华南城市率先开启了中国对市场经济的支持。每天在赛格广场外聚集的数十名代跑腿配送员都没有正式合同。他们中的大多数是退休人员，不过在夏季，像李林星这样的青年也会出现。有些人是出于经济需要，还有一些人则是为了乐趣或锻炼身体。



All of them are there because there was a need, and someone had to meet it.


之所以存在这样一个群体，是因为有需求，必须有人去满足它。



进入赛格广场狭小的电梯。 

Linxing had started a few weeks earlier, after the school year ended, at the suggestion of his uncle, a delivery driver. “Originally, I just came to see what it was like. Then, I started doing deliveries myself,” he said.


李林星是学校放假后，听从他当骑手的叔叔的建议，在几周前开始这份工作的。他说：“本来是想过来看看的，怎么送，后面看着我自己就送上去了。”



It was tiring standing in the sun from 10 or 11 a.m. until 8 p.m., he said. The building was a maze, too, with dozens of elevators, some going only to certain floors. But there was a simple reason Linxing kept coming back: “The money.”


他说，从上午10点或11点一直站在太阳底下，直到晚上8点，其实非常累人。这座大楼也像一座迷宫，有几十部电梯，有些只到特定楼层。但李林星坚持下去的原因很简单：“有钱。”



There is actually not much to be had. Runners say they generally earn about 100 yuan (about $14) a day — far less than the average wage of about $37 a day for private sector workers in Shenzhen.


其实赚得并不多。跑腿的人说，他们通常每天到手大约100元，这远低于深圳私营单位工作者每天约260元的平均工资。





The delivery drivers usually earn between 4 and 8 yuan per order, so giving the last-mile runners 2 yuan is no small cut. But the drivers say it is worth it to speed up deliveries. And for the runners, the pay is enough to be worthwhile — pocket money for teenagers, or extra cash for retirees who would have trouble being hired elsewhere.


外卖骑手通常每单赚取4到8元，所以给代送的跑腿员2元的提成可不算少。但骑手们表示，为了加快配送速度，这是值得的。而对代送者来说，这份报酬也足够划算———对青少年来说是一笔零花钱，对难以在其他地方找到工作的退休人员来说则是一份额外收入。



To get an edge over their competitors, many sprint to flag down a driver first. And some runners have perfected their techniques for maximum efficiency. They won’t head upstairs until they have enough orders to make the trip worthwhile — sometimes as many as six or seven bags in each hand.


为了超越竞争对手，许多人会冲刺着率先拦下一名骑手。一些跑腿员已经完善了他们的技巧以实现最高效率。他们会等攒够足够多的订单才上楼，这样才值得跑一趟——有时他们每只手里拿着多达六七个外卖袋。



A runner in a purple visor, who gave only her last name, Zhou, pressed the call button for a down elevator as soon as she reached her floor. By the time she had finished her delivery and run back to the elevator bank, the elevator was waiting. She said she started doing deliveries after hitting the mandatory retirement age of 50 at her job in a cafeteria. “It’s exercise,” she said. “I can’t sit at home. Doing nothing is tiring and unhealthy.”


一位只透露自己姓周的跑腿员戴着紫色遮阳帽，一到达要去的楼层就立刻按下了下行电梯的呼叫按钮。等她完成配送、跑回电梯厅时，电梯已经等在那里了。她说自己是在食堂工作到法定退休年龄50岁后开始送外卖的。“锻炼身体，”她说。“坐在家里我们闲不住，闲着也很累，闲出病来。”



Ms. Zhou picked up a steady stream of orders throughout the day, but by far the highest volume went to Shao Ziyou and his wife, who were positioned on a prime corner in front of SEG Plaza. They had so many packages that they subcontracted the actual running to a dozen people working under them. The couple took 1 yuan for every bag, the runner the other.


周女士一整天都能接到源源不断的订单，但到目前为止，拿到最高订单量的是邵子友和他的妻子，他们占据了赛格广场前一个绝佳的角落。他们的外卖袋多到不得不将实际跑腿的工作分包给手下的十几个人。这对夫妇每袋抽取1元，剩下的归跑腿员所有。



赛格广场是中国深圳最高的摩天大楼之一，入驻了成千上万的租户。 

代跑送餐员邵子友。 

This arrangement is possible because Mr. Shao is known, in local media and according to the other runners and drivers, as the first to set up outside SEG Plaza, and many drivers said they know and trust him.


这种安排之所以可行，是因为根据当地媒体以及根据其他跑腿员和司机的说法，邵子友被认为是第一个在赛格广场外开始代送服务的人，许多骑手表示认识并信任他。



Mr. Shao, 47, said he came to Shenzhen from Anhui Province in eastern China, and for a time sold circuit boards in the building’s sprawling electronics market. Seven or eight years ago, he said, he was taking a smoking break outside when a passing delivery driver complained that the building was confusing to navigate.


47岁的邵子友说，他从中国东部的安徽省来到深圳，曾在这栋大楼庞大的电子市场里卖电路板。他说，七八年前，他正在外面抽烟休息时，一位路过的外卖骑手抱怨说，这栋大楼的结构太复杂，很难找到路。





Mr. Shao said he could help make the delivery. The driver offered to buy him some water in return, but Mr. Shao said he could just pay him instead — 3 yuan, the price of a bottle.


邵子友说他可以帮忙送餐。司机提出给他买水作为回报，但邵子友建议不如直接付钱——3元，一瓶水的价格。



At first, Mr. Shao said the task was something to do during lunch breaks. Some drivers were nervous about handing over the packages, he said: “They worried I’d take it out and eat it.”


他说，一开始他只是想在午休时间找点事做。他表示，有些骑手会不放心把东西交给他：“害怕往里面拿了吃了。”



But word spread, and in 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic stopped foot traffic to the electronics market, Mr. Shao switched to deliveries full time, joined by his wife.


但消息传开了，到了2020年，当新冠疫情导致电子市场的人流戛然而止时，他和妻子就转为全职做外卖代送。



Soon, others caught wind of the opportunity: retirees from the neighborhood and people from the building’s cleaning staff, after their shifts. Inevitably, competition stiffened. Some runners offered to complete the delivery for 2.5 yuan, then 2. But business surged nonetheless, because the pandemic had made people so reliant on online deliveries. Runners expanded to some nearby buildings, too.


很快，其他人也嗅到了这个机会：有附近社区的退休人员，大楼保洁人员下班后也加入了。不可避免地，竞争变得激烈起来。有些跑腿员提出以2.5元完成配送，后来降到2元。但业务量依然激增，因为疫情让人们对外卖配送的依赖大大增加。跑腿员们也将服务范围扩展到附近的一些大楼。



“Everyone’s used to it, and people are lazy. Sometimes, you send it to their door, and they’re sitting inside and say, bring it to me here,” Mr. Shao said. “Do you want me to feed you too?”


“都习惯了，人也懒。有时候送到门口了，他坐在最里面，他说拿来我这里，”邵子友说。“我说要不要喂你？”



一名代送跑腿员正在赛格广场的一间办公室里寻找订餐的顾客。 

在午餐高峰期，电梯等待时间很长，走楼梯反而可能更省时间。 

On an average day, Mr. Shao said, he and his wife dispatch 600 or 700 orders to their assistants. If a customer complains about a missing delivery, the driver demands that Mr. Shao track it down or pay compensation. (Drivers can be fined 50 yuan by the delivery platforms for lost orders.)


邵子友说，他和妻子平均每天会向他们的助手们分派六七百单。如果顾客投诉外卖丢失，骑手就会要求他找回来，否则就得赔偿。（一旦订单丢失，外卖骑手可能会被平台罚款50元。）



Heated scenes over wayward deliveries play out multiple times a day.


关于送错外卖的激烈争执每天都会上演多次。





“5911B doesn’t order food until noon!” Mr. Shao said to a runner who had delivered to that suite in error. “I’ve been around for so long, you think I don’t know who orders early and who orders late?”


“5911B 12点才点餐，”邵子友对一个把外卖错送到那个套间的跑腿员说。“我还不知道哪家点餐早，哪家点餐晚？”



“OK, OK, I’ll pay for it,” the runner eventually admitted.


“好好好，我来赔，”那个跑腿员最终承认了失误。



Still, the atmosphere is generally civil, if chaotic. There are enough orders to go around, and most drivers said they weren’t picky about who they handed off to.


不过，虽说有些混乱，这里的气氛总体来说是友好的。订单足够多，而且大多数骑手表示他们不挑剔把外卖交给谁。



There was one exception. This summer, a new group of competitors emerged: children, some of them in elementary school. Their parents had brought them to get a taste of hard work during their summer vacations. Viral videos on social media showed hordes of children, some in pigtails or school uniforms, swarming around delivery drivers and clamoring for orders.


也有一个例外。今年夏天出现了一批新的竞争者：儿童，有些甚至还在上小学。他们的父母带他们来，想让他们在暑假里体验一下劳动的辛苦。社交媒体上的热门视频显示，成群孩子围着外卖骑手，有些扎着辫子或穿着校服，吵着要接订单。



Shao Yang, a driver, said he would not entrust the children with his orders. “I was afraid they’d get lost,” he said. “They were all really small.”


骑手邵杨（音）说，他不会把外卖交给这些孩子。“因为我怕他们找不着，”他说。“全是那种小小个子。”



Soon after the videos surfaced, the local government prohibited children from deliveries, citing safety concerns.


在这些视频出现后不久，当地政府以安全为由禁止了儿童从事外卖配送。





The legal age for regular employment in China is 16, so Linxing could keep running. He didn’t plan to stay for long, however. He wanted to find a factory job instead.


在中国，正式工作的法定年龄是16岁，所以李林星可以继续跑腿。不过，他没打算做太久。他想找一份工厂的工作。



“I like that kind of work better,” he said. “Sitting in an air-conditioned room.”


“更喜欢那样子的工作，”他说。“坐在空调房里面。”

中国正在把东海岸的部分地区改造成对台湾及其附近水域进行潜在导弹打击的平台。这是对实现中国领导人习近平的目标至关重要的准备工作的一部分，习近平志在收复台湾，并想以压倒性力量的威胁来对抗美国在亚洲的影响力。

据美国国防部估计，掌控中国核导弹和常规导弹的火箭军已在四年里增加了近50%的武器储备，让导弹数量达到了约3500枚。虽然尚不清楚目前有多少枚导弹部署在东海岸，并以台湾为目标，但卫星图像显示，火箭军的导弹旅近年来已建造了新的、更大的基地，还建了更多的发射台。

越来越先进的导弹正在这些基地部署，例如机动性更强、更难拦截的高超音速导弹东风-17，以及被一些中国人昵称“关岛快递”的东风-26，研究人员称后者具有打击关岛美军基地的能力。

中国军队一直在东部沿海地区进行导弹发射训练，发射地点包括农田、隐蔽的山谷、高速公路附近，还有一些沿海露头地带，直接面对隔着160公里海峡的台湾。

导弹“确实是中国将对台湾使用的任何军事胁迫行动的起点”，华盛顿研究机构国防重点的高级研究员詹妮弗·卡瓦纳说。“我认为，对中国来说，拥有压倒性数量的导弹也是意在发出一个政治信号，对台湾来说，这个信号是‘反抗是徒劳的’，对美国来说是不能干预。”

一旦开战，中国的导弹将对摧毁台湾的防御系统至关重要，也对美国在关岛和日本的基地构成威胁，还会让美国派去支援台湾的海军舰艇成为打击目标。在和平时期，中国用导弹试射、演习和展示来投射力量，以图恐吓台湾及其盟友。



今年9月初在北京举行的阅兵式是最近的一次军力展示，中国在阅兵式上展示了一系列新型导弹。阅兵式上还展示了似乎具有高超音速能力的新型反舰导弹，以及洲际核导弹。

“火箭军是中国军队王冠上的宝石，”美国海军退役军官、现就职于新美国安全中心的托马斯·舒加特说。“它极大地扩大了中国在几乎没有任何警告的情况下突然出击的范围。”

腐败丑闻和领导层动荡最近已严重损害了火箭军。但习近平去年在安徽省视察火箭军611旅时表达了他对该军种的支持。中国人民解放军针对台湾和西太平洋的兵力集中在这个东部省份。中国国家电视台报道这次视察时播放了习近平观看部队模拟准备机动导弹发射的画面。他要求部队“强化忧患意识、危机意识、打仗意识”。

不断扩大的导弹训练和发射中心

卫星图像显示，611旅基地的面积近年来已扩大了一倍。一些专家认为，新增加的部分可能至少包括一个训练用的建筑群，里面有发射台和用于模拟作战的假隧道。

“这是一个庞大的设施，一个基本上能进行各种作战演习的功能齐全的训练设施，”研究机构CNA的研究员德克尔·埃弗莱斯说。他对中国的导弹部队有深入研究，并在《纽约时报》的请求下仔细查看了有关611旅的卫星图像。

扩建后的611旅基地看起来以近40个导弹发射台为主，在塔夫茨大学弗莱彻法律与外交学院研究中国核力量和导弹力量的助理教授戴维·C·洛根表示，这种密集度不寻常，因为发射台通常分散在远离基地的地方，以免被发现。

另一支火箭军部队是位于611旅驻地以南江西省的616旅，其规模也已迅速扩大。2020年拍摄的卫星图像显示，甚至在新冠病毒大流行最严重的时候，中国仍在清理和平整农田，仅18个月后，一个新基地的建设已接近完工。

新一代导弹

埃弗莱斯和其他专家称，616旅目前正在为部署东风-17导弹做准备。这种导弹能以至少五倍于音速的速度飞行，并能机动躲避防御。埃弗莱斯指出了卫星图像中的一些细节，例如一个导弹仓库的高度，称那意味着该仓库可以存放这种新型导弹。

习近平在安徽视察的611旅现在正在部署东风-26导弹，这种导弹能携带常规弹头或核弹头，如其外号“关岛快递”暗示的那样，它能打击美国在亚太地区的部分军事设施。该导弹能通过公路运输，这让敌人更难追踪和摧毁。（汉斯·M·克里斯滕森和来自美国科学家联合会的其他研究人员在今年3月最早报告了611旅的基地扩建情况。）

据五角大楼的估计，中国火箭军拥有约500枚东风-26导弹。

埃弗莱斯称，如果在一场战争中，中国领导人决定将核弹头部署到一些东风-26导弹上的话，美国的卫星也许能侦察到这些导弹正从中国中部的一个仓库中调出。但他和其他专家表示，这种追踪并非万无一失，因此很难确定哪些部队可以随时部署核弹头。



这种不确定性会加剧升级的风险，也可能导致误判。

“如果台海发生冲突，尤其是如果美国在一定程度上介入或威胁介入的话，冲突会从一开始就具有核战可能性，”史汀生中心的高级研究员凯利·格里科说，她是最近一项研究的共同作者，该研究对美国在亚太地区的基地可能被中国导弹摧毁发出了警告。“像东风-26这样的系统让这种可能性变得更加凶险。”




 Source: Satellite image by CNES/Airbus, via Google Earth


中国的军事教科书和演习视频显示，在一场涉及台湾的战争中，中国的指挥官们会把机动的导弹单位分散到山洞和隐蔽的场所，以图躲避侦察。沿海地区的发射场能让部队对台湾的目标或海上的舰艇发射火箭弹后，向另一个发射场转移。

这些发射场中有一个位于中国大陆离台湾最近的地方。2022年，时任美国众议院议长的南希·佩洛西访问台湾后，作为报复，中国进行了军事演习，追踪中国人民解放军部队动向的台湾独立研究员温约瑟说，当时从那个发射场试射了能够打击台湾的火箭。温约瑟研究了中国中央电视台报道那些演习的录像，以确定演习使用了什么发射场。

中国军队还在西部沙漠地区修建了美国军舰形状的靶子，还将其安装在轨道上以模拟在海上行驶，显然是为了训练导弹发射。一旦开战，美国和其他国家的军队也许会试图摧毁中国的导弹和远程火炮部队，但打击中国大陆的目标将是一种危险的升级。

中国的军事规划者们似乎在赌导弹的数量和机动性在一场捉迷藏游戏中占上风，既避免打击，又让敌人的导弹防御系统不堪重负。最近的几项研究称，美国在亚洲的空军基地很容易受中国导弹的打击，部分原因是这些基地没有足够多的供飞机使用的加固掩体。



“虽然我们正在努力改善防御，”其中一项研究的合作者舒加特说，“但我们看到的数量如此巨大，很难想象有什么防御能不被它们冲垮，”他如此评价中国的导弹力量。

尽管如此，中国迅速加快本国导弹系统建设也并非一帆风顺。五角大楼的一项评估显示，火箭军内部的腐败问题也许已导致中国新建的核导弹发射井质量堪忧。

虽然中国的雷达和卫星已提高了导弹的精确度，但一些专家对中国导弹在实际情况下的表现持怀疑态度。例如塔夫茨大学的洛根称，在战争的混乱中飞跃大海打击舰艇，比打击固定目标要困难得多。

The airport is spread across over 1,100 hectares and will eventually have four terminals carrying 90 million passengers every year

Published
30 September 2025




For a first-time visitor, landing in India's financial capital Mumbai can be quite an experience. 
At approach, as the flight cuts across the Arabian Sea and flies past the mangrove marshes, the great metropolis emerges - swarming with railway tracks, towering skyscrapers and the dense habitation of Asia's largest shantytown pressed tightly against the airport's periphery wall.
For years, aviation experts have flagged the dangers and inefficiencies of operating an overworked airport right in the middle of such an urban setting, with buildings obstructing the flight path and safety and operational constraints preventing pilots from using the intersecting runways at once. 
But a long overdue alternative is finally on the horizon.
After numerous delays and impediments, the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) is set for inauguration soon and expected to get operational in the coming months.
The airport will "significantly ease congestion" in India's financial capital, Arun Bansal, the CEO of Adani Airport Holdings Limited, the operating company, told the BBC.
"The current airport has hit its capacity of 55 million passengers annually. There's already demand for an additional 20 million and we are set to meet that at Navi Mumbai," said Mr Bansal.
While numerous connectivity, integration and policy related hurdles still need to be ironed out, the airport's opening will turn a significant new chapter in India's aviation ambitions.

Spread over 1,100 hectares and located some 40km (24 miles) from the old commercial centre of Mumbai, the sprawling new airport is connected to the island city by India's longest sea-bridge. It has two parallel runways and will eventually handle 90 million passengers per year, following subsequent phases of expansion.
"NMIA will make Mumbai the first large Indian city to operate two airports - a demonstration of the growing importance of India as an aviation market with rapidly increasing passenger and air traffic," said Shukor Yusof of Singapore-based Enadu Analytics.
The sector has seen double-digit growth , externalin the last four years - outpacing most other regions in the world. Indian airlines have placed orders for some 1,900 new aircraft, a thousand of which are expected to be delivered in the next five years, making such infrastructure critically important to accommodate this new fleet.
Adani says NMIA will be India's first fully digital airport that's been "designed and developed specifically to become a hub airport" with advanced technology for check-in, security, baggage and boarding drastically reducing turnaround times and facilitating easy transfers.
It has already announced a partnership with India's largest and newest carriers, Indigo and Akasa Airlines, who are launching new routes. And Air India has committed to flying to 15 cities from the airport, gradually scaling up operations, including flights to international destinations.
Given how starved Mumbai's current airport is for capacity, analysts expect strong uptake for NMIA's parking slots from airlines looking to launch new routes.
But major challenges are expected as operations commence in the coming months.

Given how far the airport is, its location could be a significant inconvenience to passengers - both when taking flights to and from NMIA, and especially when using it for connecting flights.
It can easily take between two and three hours to reach the airport from certain suburbs of Mumbai. 
A direct 20-minute metro line between the old and the new airports is likely to become a reality only after a few years. In the interim, NMIA is planning to provide electric buses at regular intervals for passengers with connections.
"This is not ideal," says Alok Anand, a Bengaluru city-based aviation consultant, but it is typical of many projects in India where supporting infrastructure follows, rather than being built in tandem.
"Until last mile connectivity is fixed, I don't foresee anyone landing at one airport and travelling to the other to catch another flight," Mr Anand says.
It's probably why, for now, both the existing and the new airport will handle domestic and international traffic, even though in the longer run, when connectivity improves, overseas flights may exclusively fly from NMIA.

Connectivity and regulatory issues could also become impediments to NMIA's ambitions to make Mumbai an international hub like Singapore or Dubai - where flights come from various destinations and connect passengers to onward routes around the world.
While NMIA, along with a few other airports in cities like Hyderabad and Bengaluru, are technologically advanced and compete with some of the best in the world, India still needs to revise its policies to facilitate smoother transfers, which is key to succeeding as a hub, say experts.
"For instance, to transfer from domestic to international terminals or vice versa,  one needs to undergo security screening again, which is not required at most major global airports," says Ajay Awtaney, editor of LiveFromALounge, an online aviation and hospitality portal.
"Additionally, we need to reassess our security practices to improve the efficiency of passenger throughput. Our contact frisking at the airport takes significantly more time than other airports, which have transitioned to body scanners," Mr Awtaney adds.
Mr Bansal agrees that a lot of this will need to fall in place before Mumbai's aviation profile is raised to global standards. 
A change in regulation, he says, will also need to be accompanied by airlines' willingness to expand their choice of long-haul destinations. Carriers will also have to optimise their fleet strategy and connections to be able to leverage the city's strategic location advantage between Europe, the US and Asia.
For now, NMIA solves the city's immediate problem - acute air traffic congestion.
It will also serve as a larger catchment area, which could extend all the way to the neighbouring Pune city, a major IT and education hub.
"Some of the major cities around the globe, such as New York, London, Dubai, and Tokyo, all operate with two to three airports. Mumbai will join this select club," says Mr Awtaney.
And so will Delhi, where a third airport - Jewar - is all set to open in the coming months, to serve the capital's satellite areas.

Cheryl Grimmer was three when she disappeared from Fairy Meadow beach in January 1970


ByJon Kay, presenter of Fairy Meadow podcast & BBC Breakfast and George Sandeman



Published
30 September 2025




The family of a toddler who disappeared from an Australian beach more than 50 years ago have criticised police for not formally interviewing potential eyewitnesses during a review of the case.
Officers suspect three-year-old Cheryl Grimmer was abducted from Fairy Meadow beach, which is about 50 miles (80km) south of Sydney in New South Wales (NSW), when she went missing on 12 January 1970. The Grimmer family had only just emigrated from the UK. 
They have now been told the review, which took four years to complete, has not brought up any new evidence that could lead to a conviction.
They are angry that three potential eyewitnesses who spoke to the BBC were not formally interviewed by officers, despite their contact details being passed to police.


'How did my sister vanish from Fairy Meadow?'

New witness in Fairy Meadow disappearance


Ricki Nash, Cheryl's brother, said he felt "total frustration" about the way the review had been handled, which he understood was "meant to be a detailed, full review" of the case.
"There are no words, just nothing," he said of the decision not to formally interview the potential eyewitnesses. "Our family can't move forward without the help of the police."
The three potential eyewitnesses came forward after the BBC aired the Fairy Meadow true crime podcast in 2022, which has since been downloaded five million times.
One man, who asked to keep his identity private, said he had seen a teenage boy carrying away a small child from changing rooms beside the beach on the day Cheryl disappeared.


Fairy Meadow

In 1970, three-year-old Cheryl Grimmer was taken from an Australian beach. No-one knows what happened. Fifty years on - can the mystery be solved?




Listen on Sounds


The man said he had a brief chat over the phone with NSW Police after telling the BBC about what he saw, but did not hear from the force again.
Damian Loone, a retired detective who worked on Cheryl's case, said he believed the man's testimony was "very credible".

In 2017, a man in his 60s was charged with Cheryl's abduction and murder after officers discovered a confession made to police by a teenage boy in 1971. 
A judge later ruled the confession could not be presented as trial evidence.
The defendant - known only by his police codename "Mercury" because he was a minor at the time of the alleged offences - was freed in 2019 and all charges, which he denied, were dropped.
In a new episode of the Fairy Meadow podcast, former Det Sgt Loone said he "just can't fathom" why the police did not formally interview the man who spoke to the BBC, something he would have done if he was still in charge of the investigation into Cheryl's disappearance.
"I think that's sloppy police work," he added. "That's what they should have done and I can't believe that it hasn't happened."
He said he believed the man was "the only independent witness" that was at Fairy Meadow beach who saw a teenage boy - aged around 16 or 17 - with Cheryl on the day she went missing. 
"We know that the suspect Mercury was [of] that age group at the time," he added.
Kay Tutton, another potential eyewitness, contacted the BBC to say she saw a man taking a little girl away from the beach on the day Cheryl disappeared.





"I just [remember] this lovely little girl and she was very upset. And this man had her tightly by the hand and said 'come on'. She obviously didn't want to go."
Kay went to a police station shortly after seeing a news report about Cheryl going missing in 1970 but officers did not speak to her again after she told them what she saw.
The BBC provided them with updated contact details after Kay, now aged 82, emailed us about the podcast - but she has not heard from officers.
Another woman, who also asked to keep her identity private, told us she had been approached by a man on a beach near Fairy Meadow a few days before Cheryl disappeared. She says she hasn't been contacted by NSW Police either.
"I've got this information that I could give to them and they are not interested, you know? I'm just disappointed," she told us. "It could lead to something."
Cheryl's brother Ricki, now 62, was seven years old when she disappeared. The pair had been together in changing rooms beside Fairy Meadow beach but after he turned away for a few seconds, she was gone.
He has written an open letter highlighting what he believes are errors in the police investigation dating back to the day she went missing.

A petition asking the state parliament to set up an inquiry into missing persons investigations overseen by NSW Police, such as Cheryl's, attracted more than 10,000 signatures this summer.
It was debated in parliament, but in a letter responding to petitioners, the state's minister for police and counter-terrorism made no commitment to holding an inquiry.
NSW Police said all the information it received, including potential eyewitness accounts from the BBC, was properly assessed. They said it was not the case that everyone who contacted them would be interviewed.
"Each submission is evaluated on its merits, and decisions regarding subsequent action are made in accordance with investigative standards and the relevance of the information to the established facts."
They added that they met members of Cheryl's family last September for a three-hour discussion about the police review in which "all known and verified facts were clearly outlined".
In 2020, 50 years after Cheryl disappeared, NSW Police offered a reward of one million Australian dollars (£529,000) to anybody who had information that led to a successful conviction.
Ricki told us: "You offer a million dollar reward, people come forward, you don't speak to them. Why offer the reward?
"Was that just to appease our family, appease the public, just to make yourselves look good - look like you're doing something? In actual fact, you're doing nothing."

On Tuesday night, Jimmy Kimmel was back on the air, and many Americans concerned about government coercion seemed to breathe a sigh of relief.


周二晚，吉米·坎摩尔重返荧屏，许多担心政府高压政治的美国人似乎松了一口气。



Though Mr. Kimmel’s employer, Disney, should have never caved to pressure to remove a talk-show host, the thinking went, and though it took too long for business leaders to stand up to the president’s bullying, they allowed, at least corporate America was finally drawing a line in the sand. “This is about fighting for free speech and against these abuses by Donald Trump,” Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, wrote on X.


尽管坎摩尔的雇主迪士尼根本不该屈服于压力让这位脱口秀主持人停播——这是舆论的普遍看法，尽管商界领袖对总统霸凌行为的反抗来得太晚——这一点他们也承认，但美国企业界终归还是表明了立场。参议院民主党领袖查克·舒默在社交媒体平台X上写道：“这关乎为言论自由而战，反对唐纳德·特朗普的这些滥权行为。”



But if the first eight months of the Trump presidency are any indication, the initial capitulation by Disney appears to be the more revealing part of the episode. After all, it’s hardly the first time that corporate America has caved to the administration.


若以特朗普执政前八个月的情形为参照，迪士尼最初的屈服似乎更能体现这一事件的本质。毕竟，这绝非美国商界首次向白宫低头。



When Mr. Trump first issued an executive order against a prominent law firm, the firm quickly sued, and several more firms discussed joining a collective response. But by the following month, nine major firms had cut deals with the White House.


当特朗普首次发布行政令打击某家知名律师事务所时，该所立即提起诉讼，另有数家律所商讨联合应对。但到了次月，这九家大律所与白宫达成了协议。





After Mr. Trump suggested he might fire the chair of the Federal Reserve, some Wall Street chief executives gently pushed back, emphasizing the importance of an independent Fed. But these executives seemed to go mysteriously silent about Mr. Trump’s actual firing of a Federal Reserve governor. (Mr. Trump alleged that the governor had committed mortgage fraud, which she denied.)


当特朗普暗示可能解雇美联储主席时，一些华尔街的首席执行官还曾温和地提出反对，强调美联储独立性的重要。但在特朗普真的着手解雇一名美联储理事时，这些高管却神秘地沉默起来。（特朗普声称该理事涉及房贷欺诈，但她予以否认。）



Even ABC’s fellow broadcaster, CBS, showed some fight after Mr. Trump sued it for $10 billion (later increased to $20 billion) over what appeared to be the unremarkable editing of a news interview. CBS journalists appeared uncowed during a May 4 segment on “60 Minutes” featuring a Democratic election lawyer who compared the president to a “mob boss” seeking “protection money.” But CBS’s corporate parent settled two months later.


即便是与美国广播公司(ABC)同属电视媒体的哥伦比亚广播公司(CBS)，在特朗普因一段看似寻常的新闻采访剪辑而发起诉讼索赔100亿美元（后来增加至200亿美元）后，一度展现出抗争的姿态。5月4日，《60分钟》的记者们毫无畏惧，还采访了一名民主党选举律师，他将总统比作一个索取“保护费”的“黑帮老大”。但两个月后，CBS的母公司还是选择了和解。



Why are leaders in the media, law and finance failing to stand up more forcefully to what many inside these industries say are abuses of presidential power?


为何来自媒体、法律和金融领域的领袖人物，未能更有力地反抗许多业内人士所称的总统权力滥用？



Fear is the most obvious answer. They are scared that the president will do more damage if they try to resist, scared that he may even target them personally.


恐惧是最显而易见的答案。他们害怕如若反抗会招致总统更猛烈的报复，甚至担心自己成为被针对的目标。



“It’s astonishing how spineless the masters of the universe and big bad billionaires really are,” said Dennis Kelleher, a former corporate lawyer and Senate staff member who runs the financial reform group Better Markets. “If they’re going to cravenly capitulate over the independence of the Fed, it’s pretty clear they will not stand up for anything.”


“那些宇宙主宰者和手眼通天的大富豪竟然如此懦弱，真是令人震惊，”曾担任企业律师和参议员幕僚，现为金融改革组织“更好的市场”负责人的丹尼斯·凯勒赫说道。“如果他们在美联储的独立性问题上都能如此卑躬屈膝，那么很明显，他们不会为任何事情挺身而出。”



Sheer terror undeniably plays an important role. But there appears to be a deeper explanation, too. Resisting government coercion is often a matter of collective action: Companies are much more likely to succeed if they stand together, rather than fight on their own. “It’s easy to pick off individual companies,” Mark Mizruchi, a sociologist at the University of Michigan who studies large corporations, said in an interview. “But if they’re all coming after you as a single collective, you can’t — he’d tank the whole economy.”


纯粹的恐惧无疑扮演了重要角色。但似乎还存在一个更深层次的原因。抗拒政府胁迫往往需要集体行动：如果企业能团结一致，而非单打独斗，它们成功的可能性会大得多。“逐个对付单个企业很容易，”密歇根大学研究大企业的社会学家马克·米兹鲁奇在接受采访时说，“但如果它们作为一个整体来对抗你，你就无法得逞——他会拖垮整个经济。”





Over the past few generations, however, the culture and ethos of the American business elite has changed. A once cohesive establishment has broken down, making collective action rarer and much harder to achieve. Competition among companies has become increasingly cutthroat. Chief executives are often more concerned with their share price than their company’s long-term health, much less any genteel sense of obligation to a vague greater good. The civic organizations that once bonded corporate leaders to one another have been hollowed out or disappeared altogether.


然而，在过去的几代人里，美国商界精英的文化和精神面貌已经发生了变化。原本紧密团结的精英圈子已经瓦解，使得集体行动变得更加罕见，也更难实现。企业间的竞争愈发残酷。首席执行官们往往更关心公司的股价，而非其长远的健康发展，更遑论那种模糊的、出于公共利益的责任感。曾经把企业领袖们联结在一起的公民组织已被掏空，甚至彻底消失。



“There’s no conceivable way anything like this could have occurred in the 1950s or ’60s,” added Mr. Mizruchi, author of “The Fracturing of the American Corporate Elite.” But today, “it’s every person for themselves.”


“在1950、60年代，发生这样的情况是根本无法想象的，”著有《美国企业精英的分裂》(The Fracturing of the American Corporate Elite)一书的米兹鲁奇补充道。但如今，“每个人都是自顾自的。”



The Rise of Shareholder Capitalism


股东资本主义的崛起



The business world of the 1950s and 1960s was a clubby, inbred place and its apotheosis was the boardroom — especially the bank boardroom. The country’s biggest banks populated their boards with chief executives from a wide range of industries in order to keep tabs on the economy. When they gathered around a conference table, the executives tended to agree on matters large and small.


上世纪五六十年代的商业世界是一个排外封闭、近亲繁殖的圈子，它的极致体现便是董事会——尤其是银行的董事会。为了掌握经济动向，美国各大银行的董事会成员囊括了来自各行各业的总裁。当这些高管们围坐在会议桌旁时，他们倾向于在所有大小事务上达成一致。



The bank boards “served as a source of normative consensus and stability among the leaders of the largest corporations, in part by helping to forge similar worldviews and behavior,” Mr. Mizruchi wrote in his book.


正如米兹鲁奇在书中写道，这些银行董事会“通过帮助塑造相似的世界观和行为模式，在一定程度上促成顶尖企业领袖群体中的规范共识与稳定性”。



The agenda that these executives hashed out often reached far beyond their individual companies: Keynesian economic policies at home, anti-Communism abroad and, above all else, social order. It was an agenda of patrician civic-mindedness, built on feelings of mutual interest that often transcended party lines. And they enacted it through organizations and associations that allowed them to act as a unified front.


这些企业高管们所拟定的议程往往远超各自公司的范围：在国内推动凯恩斯主义的经济政策，在海外反对共产主义，而最重要的是维护社会秩序。那是一种带有贵族气质的公共精神议程，建立在超越党派界限的共同利益感之上。他们通过各种组织和协会来推动这些议程，这使他们能够以一个统一的阵线采取行动。





The Wall Street lawyer John McCloy, who served as the chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank as well as the Ford Foundation and the Council on Foreign Relations, was so well-situated that he came to be known as “the chairman of the establishment.”


华尔街律师约翰·麦克洛伊曾担任大通曼哈顿银行董事长，以及福特基金会和外交关系委员会的主席，他的地位如此之高，以至于后来被称为“商界统治集团的主席”。



Other business leaders joined groups like the Committee for Economic Development, which advocated what they considered to be sound economic policy. The committee, whose trustees included the president of General Electric and the chairman of Coca-Cola, was a key player in the making of the Marshall Plan and pressed the government to hold down unemployment by spending more and cutting taxes during recessions. After President Richard Nixon pressured the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in the early 1970s, another group of top executives, the Business Council, announced that a majority of its economic consultants had “strong concern” that the government’s approach would trigger “more rapid inflation.” (Inflation did subsequently spiral.)


其他商界领袖也加入了像经济发展委员会这样的团体，倡导他们认为合理的经济政策。该委员会的成员包括通用电气的总裁、可口可乐的董事长，在马歇尔计划的制定中发挥了关键作用，并敦促政府在经济衰退期间通过增加支出和减税来抑制失业。上世纪70年代初，当尼克松总统向美联储施压要求降低利率后，另一个顶级高管组成的商业理事会就宣布，其大多数经济顾问“强烈担忧”政府的方法会引发“更快速的通货膨胀”。（事实证明，通胀随后果然急剧恶化。）



By the mid-1970s, however, this order was collapsing. Global competition and inflation chipped away at the profits that had kept the boardroom-dwellers feeling flush, and social change was chipping away at the race and gender barriers that had kept boardrooms so white and male. Prominent conservatives, like the Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, had urged business leaders to fund opposition to government intervention in the economy and other threats to free enterprise. Their efforts helped pave the way for the deregulation of industries like airlines, media, telecom and finance.


然而到了70年代中期，这种秩序开始瓦解。全球竞争和通货膨胀侵蚀了让董事会成员感到财务宽裕的利润，社会变革也冲击了长期将董事会局限为白人男性的种族和性别壁垒。与此同时，像最高法院大法官刘易斯·鲍威尔这样的保守派知名人物，敦促商界领袖资助反对政府干预经济和对自由企业构成其他威胁的行动。他们的努力为航空、媒体、电信和金融等行业放松管制铺平了道路。



Around the same time, a new theory was descending from the ivory tower. Based on the work of economists like Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago and Michael Jensen of the University of Rochester, it held that the interests of shareholders should reign supreme in corporate decision-making, and that the key challenge of capitalism was to ensure that the hired help — that is, the executives — did what was best for the owners.


大约在同一时期，一种新理论从象牙塔中传出。基于芝加哥大学的米尔顿·弗里德曼和罗切斯特大学的迈克尔·詹森等经济学家的研究，该理论认为股东利益应当在公司决策中处于至高无上的位置，而资本主义的核心挑战是如何确保受雇的管理层（也就是高管们）做出对股东最有利的事情。



Economists of this ilk favored tying executive pay to a company’s share price, through stock options and stock grants. But their thinking unleashed a broader revolution, in which companies with underperforming stock became targets for corporate raiders, who could take them over, fire management and unlock vast piles of wealth.


持这种观点的经济学家主张通过股票期权和股票奖励将高管薪酬与公司股价挂钩。但他们的思路引发了一场更广泛的革命：股价表现不佳的公司成了企业掠夺者的目标，这些掠夺者会收购企业、解雇管理层，并释放出大量财富。



Within a decade, the incentives of chief executives had completely changed. In the heyday of John McCloy and the bank boardroom, most chief executives had only a vague mandate to look out for their “stakeholders,” and often sought to maximize status and influence. By the 1980s, chief executives had to spend their waking hours plotting to maximize their share price, or find themselves out on their ear.


在十年之内，首席执行官们的激励措施已经彻底改变。在约翰·麦克洛伊和银行董事会的黄金年代，大多数首席执行官只有一个模糊的使命去关照他们的“利益相关者”，他们追求的往往是地位和影响力的最大化。到了80年代，首席执行官们不得不把所有精力都放在如何最大化公司股价上，否则就会发现自己在业内混不下去。





After relatively little turnover among the country’s largest corporations throughout the 20th century, almost one-third of the Fortune 500 companies vanished in the 1980s, many because of hostile takeovers. The average tenure of a Fortune 500 chief executive dropped from about nine and a half years in the early 1980s to around seven years in 2002, according to Mr. Mizruchi’s book, where it has continued to hover.


在整个20世纪，美国顶级大企业的更替率一直很低，到了80年代，近三分之一的财富500强公司消失了，其中许多是因为恶意收购。根据米兹鲁奇书中的记载，财富500强首席执行官的平均任期从1980年代初的大约九年半下降到2002年的七年左右，并一直徘徊在这一水平。



But breaking up the American business establishment did have at least one major downside: It made it increasingly unlikely for companies to stand together. Instead of trying to fit in at the club, executives were inclined to kneecap fellow club members.


但是瓦解美国商界统治集团至少带来一个重大弊端：企业间越来越难以团结协作。高管们不再试图融入那个俱乐部，反而倾向于对俱乐部同伴下绊子。



One clear measure of this was their behavior in Washington. Through at least the 1960s, a large majority of corporate lobbying was a collective enterprise — it happened through trade associations, not lobbyists that companies hired directly. That had completely reversed itself a generation later. In 1998, the typical industry spent about 63 percent of its lobbying money on its own lobbyists rather than trade associations, according to the political scientist Lee Drutman. By 2012, that portion had jumped to 71 percent.


一个明显的衡量标准就是他们在华盛顿的行为。至少到20世纪60年代，大部分企业的游说还是集体行动——通过行业协会来进行，而不是各自单独雇佣说客。但到了一代人之后，这种情况完全颠倒了。政治学者李·德鲁特曼的研究显示，1998年，一个典型行业大约有63%的游说经费花在了雇佣自己的说客上，而不是行业协会；到了2012年，这一比例已跃升至71%。



“Shareholder capitalism puts intense pressure on quarterly earnings,” Mr. Drutman said in an interview. And that turned into pressure to gain an advantage over competitors with the government. “It becomes a real arms race,” he said.


“股东资本主义给季度盈利带来了巨大的压力，”德鲁特曼在采访中说。而这种压力又转化为通过政府获取竞争优势的压力。“这简直成了一场名副其实的军备竞赛。”



Getting Yours


各谋其利



In some ways, corporations have never been more powerful. But they are also more vulnerable than ever to outside pressure — at exactly the moment when a president was determined to bend them to his will.


在某些方面，企业比以往任何时候都更强大。但与此同时，它们也比以往任何时候都更容易受到外部压力的影响——恰恰是在这个时刻，出现了一个决心迫使它们屈从于自己意志的总统。





The country’s biggest banks have trillions in assets. But while bankers were once at the center of the club, they have spent the last few decades in an uneasy competition with hedge funds, private equity firms, asset managers and insurance-companies-that-act-like-banks.


美国最大的几家银行拥有数万亿美元的资产。但尽管银行家曾处于那个俱乐部的核心位置，在过去几十年里，他们却一直在与对冲基金、私募股权公司、资产管理公司以及行为类似银行的保险公司进行着令人不安的竞争。



Two banking-industry officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject matter, highlighted the rising challenge from financial tech firms and cryptocurrency, which have brought about fears that customers might go around traditional banks.


两位因话题敏感要求匿名的银行业官员强调，来自金融科技公司和加密货币的挑战正在上升，已引发客户可能绕过传统银行的担忧。



“If I’m a traditional investment bank, my first instinct would be crypto should be regulated like everything else,” said Mr. Drutman, the author of “The Business of America is Lobbying.” “But now that it’s not going to be, my second instinct is, ‘How do I make it work for me?’” When the collective solution fails, make sure you get yours.


“如果我是传统投行，我的第一反应是：加密货币应该像其他东西一样受到监管，”《美国的生意就是游说》(The Business of America is Lobbying)一书的作者德鲁特曼说。“但既然监管不可能到位，我的第二反应就是：‘我该怎么让它为我所用？’”当集体解决方案行不通时，至少要确保自己能捞到好处。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[“我们从历史中吸取的教训是，我们没有从历史中吸取到教训，”江似虹在2018年说。 Tina Kanagaratnam


Tess Johnston, a former U.S. foreign service officer who was posted to South Vietnam during the war and documented her experience as a woman there, then spent many years in Shanghai rallying support for the preservation of its vanishing colonial architecture, died on Sept. 14 in Washington. She was 93.


江似虹(Tess Johnston)曾任美国外交官，在越战期间派驻南越并记录了她作为女性在那里的经历，此后长居上海，为保护这座城市逐渐消失的租界建筑奔走呼吁。她于9月14日在华盛顿去世，享年93岁。



Her death, from complications of Covid-19 in an assisted living facility, was announced by Tina Kanagaratnam, a founder of the organization Historic Shanghai. Ms. Johnston, Ms. Kanagaratnam and her husband, Patrick Cranley, started the group in 1998, aiming to help safeguard the architecture and culture of Shanghai that predates China’s Communist revolution. In recent years, much of the cityscape has given way to gleaming skyscrapers.


她在一家辅助生活机构中离世，死因是新冠并发症。这一消息由“上海旧踪”(Historic Shanghai)组织的创始人之一蒂娜·卡纳加拉特南宣布。江似虹与卡纳加拉特南及其丈夫帕特里克·克兰利于1998年创办了该组织，旨在帮助保护上海在中国共产党革命之前的建筑和文化。近年来，这座城市的大部分景观都被闪亮的高楼大厦所取代。



Through her books and lectures, Ms. Johnston called attention to the importance of preserving “the historic city before it changed beyond recognition,” Historic Shanghai said in a statement, adding that “she generously shared her knowledge with a generation of writers, scholars and Shanghailanders.”


“上海旧踪”在一份声明中表示，江似虹通过她的书籍和讲座呼吁人们关注保护“这座历史名城，以免其面目全非”的重要性。声明还说：“她慷慨地与一代作家、学者和老上海人分享了她的知识。”



Ms. Johnston, who had no formal training in historic preservation, focused on Shanghai’s eclectic colonial architecture — its early-20th-century Spanish villas, onion-domed Russian Orthodox churches and Art Deco structures — all built by expatriates from 1842, when China ceded control of the urban core to the British after the First Opium War, until World War II and the Communist takeover in 1949.


并非历史保护科班出身的江似虹专注于上海兼收并蓄的租界建筑——包括其20世纪初的西班牙式别墅、洋葱头圆顶的俄罗斯东正教堂和装饰艺术风格的建筑。这些建筑是由侨居者在1842年至1949年（即从中国在第一次鸦片战争后将市中心割让给英国，直到“二战”结束和共产党接管）期间建造的。



Those structures predominated in the French quarter and peppered the American, Russian and Japanese sections of the city. Ms. Johnston documented the architecture on virtually every street. With the Shanghai photographer Er Dong Qiang (also known as Deke Erh), she published “A Last Look: Western Architecture in Old Shanghai,” the first of her two dozen books on architectural history and walking tours, in 1993.


这些建筑主要集中在法租界，也散布在美国、俄罗斯和日本人在该市的聚居区。江似虹记录了几乎每条街道上的建筑。她与上海摄影师尔冬强合作，于1993年出版了《最后一瞥——上海西洋建筑》(A Last Look: Western Architecture in Old Shanghai)，这是她关于建筑历史和徒步旅行的二十多本书中的第一本。



江似虹著有多部有关上海建筑史的书籍，第一本出版于1993年。 Old China Hand Press

She also recorded oral histories and collected a trove of ephemera — cricket cages, phone books, tables with secret drawers. She later donated her archives to the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.


她还录制口述历史，并收集了大量具有时代印记的小物件——包括蟋蟀笼、电话簿和带有秘密抽屉的桌子。她后来将全部的档案资料捐赠给了斯坦福大学的胡佛研究所。



Ms. Johnston, who spoke fluent Mandarin but never lost her Southern accent — she was born in North Carolina — served at the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai from 1981 until she retired in 1996. Having grown to love the city, she then decided to remain there. By the time she returned to Washington, in 2016, few if any foreign residents of Shanghai had lived in the city longer than she had.


江似虹能说一口流利的普通话，但从未失去她的美国南方口音——她出生于北卡罗来纳州。她从1981年开始在美国驻上海总领事馆任职，直至1996年退休。她渐渐爱上了这座城市，决定留在那里。到2016年返回华盛顿时，已经很少有——可能完全没有——外国人居住在上海的时间比她长。





Of her first impressions of the city, Ms. Johnston once said: “I had never been to a foreign country that looked so utterly and completely Western. It was perfectly preserved, a cross between Warsaw in 1938 and Calcutta, a totally Western city with an Asian population.”


谈到她对这座城市的第一印象时，江似虹曾说：“我从未去过一个看起来如此彻底和完全西化的外国城市。它被完美地保存了下来，是1938年的华沙和加尔各答的结合体，一座完全西方的城市，却有着亚洲的人口。”



Because the Communist Party was more concerned with doctrine than demolition, she told The Guardian in 1997: “We have the Cultural Revolution to thank for Shanghai’s preservation. Otherwise, we would be 25 years further down the road. There would be nothing left.”


她在1997年告诉《卫报》，因为中国共产党当时更关心意识形态而非拆除：“我们还得感谢文化大革命对上海的‘保护’。否则，我们会提前25年走到今天。什么都不会剩下。”



Still, she said, when she arrived in Shanghai in 1981, the city’s tallest building was 22 stories, and when she left, there were three skyscrapers taller than the Empire State Building.


不过她也提到，1981年抵达上海时，这座城市最高的建筑只有22层；而当她离开时，已经有三座摩天大楼比帝国大厦还要高。

Lestine Rebecca Johnston was born on Sept. 17, 1931, in Charlotte, N.C., the only child of Lester G. Johnston, who sold petroleum products, and Alma (Yoder) Johnston, who oversaw the home. She grew up in Charlottesville, Va.


江似虹（本名莱斯汀·丽贝卡·约翰斯顿）于1931年9月17日出生于北卡罗来纳州夏洛特市，是家中独女。父亲莱斯特·约翰斯顿从事石油产品销售，目前阿尔玛·约翰斯顿（娘家姓尤德尔）主持家务。她在弗吉尼亚州夏洛茨维尔长大。



After graduating from high school, Lestine, who went by Tess, briefly worked for an advertising agency in Richmond, Va. She joined the foreign service in 1953 as a secretary after a relative had tutored her in typing and shorthand.


高中毕业后，莱斯汀（她常用泰丝这个名字）曾在弗吉尼亚州里士满的一家广告公司短暂工作。在一位亲戚辅导她掌握打字和速记技能后，她于1953年以秘书的身份加入了美国外交系统。



Ms. Johnston was posted to the American consulate in Düsseldorf, Germany, where she became interested in vintage buildings. She soon returned home to pursue a college degree at the University of Virginia. She wanted to major in architectural history, she said, but found that the subject was not available to undergraduate women. Instead she studied English, history and German literature, earning a bachelor’s degree in education in 1961 and a master’s in German in 1963. She also obtained a master’s degree from the College of William and Mary in 1964.


她被派往德国杜塞尔多夫美国领事馆工作，在那里对老式建筑产生了兴趣。不久她回到国内，进入弗吉尼亚大学攻读学位。她说，她本想主修建筑史，但发现本科女性不能选择该科目。于是她转而学习英语、历史和德语文学，于1961年获得教育学士学位，1963年获得德语硕士学位。她还于1964年获得了威廉与玛丽学院的硕士学位。





That same year, she joined the U.S. Agency for International Development in South Vietnam, where she worked as an aide to Wilbur Wilson and John Paul Vann, military advisers to the South Vietnamese Army. She documented her experiences there in “A War Away: An American Woman in Vietnam, 1967-1974,” a 2018 memoir in which she recounted witnessing the Tet offensive by the North Vietnamese and Vietcong in 1968.


同年，她加入了美国国际开发署，派驻南越，担任威尔伯·威尔逊和约翰·保罗·范恩的助手，这两位是南越军队的军事顾问。她在2018年的回忆录《一场远方的战争：一个美国女人在越南，1967-1974》(A War Away: An American Woman in Vietnam, 1967-1974)中记录了她在越南的经历，书中她回忆了亲历1968年北越和越共发动的春节攻势。



Ms. Johnston didn’t hesitate to visit hazardous combat zones. Mr. Vann, she wrote, “loved gutsy females,” and she recalled that when visiting dignitaries were reluctant to accompany him on helicopter tours of the battlefields, he would reply, “My secretaries go out with me all the time.”


江似虹从不畏惧深入危险战区。她回忆说，范恩“喜欢有胆量的女性”，当到访的政要不愿陪同范恩乘坐直升机视察战场时，范恩会回答：“我的秘书们经常和我一起出去。”



(Mr. Vann, who became disillusioned with the war and died in a helicopter crash in South Vietnam in 1972, was profiled by the former New York Times correspondent Neil Sheehan in “A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam,” which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1989.)


（范恩后来对这场战争感到失望，他于1972年在南越因直升机失事身亡。前《纽约时报》记者尼尔·希恩在他的著作《闪亮的谎言：约翰·保罗·范恩与美国在越南》(A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam)中为他立传，该书于1989年获得普利策奖。）



Following the war, Ms. Johnston rejoined the State Department, serving in New Delhi and Tehran before being transferred to Shanghai in 1981 and named executive secretary to the consul general. Apart from a brief stint in Paris in the late 1980s, she would remain there for 35 years.


战争结束后，江似虹重新加入了国务院，先后在新德里和德黑兰任职，随后于1981年调往上海，被任命为总领事行政秘书。除了1980年代末在巴黎短暂逗留外，她接下来将在上海生活35年。

In 1986, she was named Foreign Service Secretary of the Year for her role in coordinating President Ronald Reagan’s visit to Shanghai.


1986年，她因在协调罗纳德·里根总统访问上海方面发挥的作用，被评为“年度外交秘书”。



She left no immediate survivors.


江似虹没有直系亲属在世。





While Shanghai has designated hundreds of buildings as historic landmarks since she began her crusade, other Chinese cities were neglecting their heritage, Ms. Johnston told The New York Times in 1998.


她在1998年告诉《纽约时报》，尽管上海在她开始保护运动以来指定了数百座建筑为历史地标，但其他中国城市仍在忽视它们的历史遗产。



“What we learn from history,” she said, “is that we don’t learn from history.”


她说：“我们从历史中学到的教训是，我们没有从历史中吸取教训。”



She expressed hope, though, that her books would immortalize Shanghai’s split reputation as “the Paris of the East” and what she called the “wickedest city in the East,” associated with the drugging and kidnapping of American sailors in the 19th century.


不过，她还是希望她的著作能够使上海作为“东方巴黎”和她所说的“东方最邪恶城市”（因19世纪美国水手被下药和绑架事件而来）的这种双重声誉成为永恒。



“Maybe people will look at our books one day and say, ‘So that’s what China looked like,’” she said.


她说：“也许有一天人们会看着我们的书说，‘原来中国那时是这个样子。’”



In her mind’s eye, as well as in her books and the nearly century-old buildings she helped preserve, Shanghai’s past lived on.


在她的脑海中、在她的书中，以及在她出力保护的那些近百年的建筑中，上海的过去一直活生生地存在着。



“I found on arrival this perfectly preserved Western-looking city sitting here on the improbable shores of China,” she said in an interview with the Shanghai Daily newspaper in 2010.


“我到达时看到了一座保存完好的西式城市，坐落在不可思议的中国海岸上，”她在2010年接受《上海日报》采访时说。





“Shanghai seems to have something, some mystique that grabs foreigners and makes it hard to leave,” she added. “So I didn’t.”


“上海似乎有一种魔力，抓住了外国人，让他们难以离开，”她还说。“所以我没有离开。”

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The fear of Russia's influence was apparently considerable: In a surprise outcome, Moldova's ruling pro-European PAS retained its absolute majority in Sunday's parliamentary election.

"Russia and Russian influence? No thank you!" This was the clear message sent out by an unexpectedly large majority of voters in Sunday's parliamentary election in the Republic of Moldova.
The winner by a clear margin was the ruling pro-European Action and Solidarity (PAS) party, which contrary to all opinion poll predictions in the run-up to the election, garnered just over 50% of the vote, unexpectedly retaining its absolute majority.
Even though it lost eight seats, it is still likely to have a majority of 55 of the 101 seats in parliament.
The pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc alliance led by former President Igor Dodon got just 24% of the vote, a result that was much lower than anticipated by many opinion polls.
Pro-Russian, pro-Romanian parties in parliament
Other parties that passed the threshold to enter parliament are the nominally neutral, but de facto pro-Russian political alliance known as Alternative, which is led by Mayor of Chisinau, Ion Ceban (approximately 8%), and the party of populist businessman Renato Usatii, Our Party (6%).

In another major surprise that wasn't predicted by any opinion poll or pundit, the right-wing populist Democracy at Home Party (PPDA) got 5.6% of the vote, which means that it, too, will be represented in parliament.
PPDA is in favor of a reunification of Moldova and Romania and is allied with the far-right Romanian party Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR), whose leader, George Simion, is barred from entering Moldova.
Victory not down to the diaspora vote alone
Once all votes had been counted, it became clear that PAS had not only received a significant majority of the votes cast by the Moldovan diaspora in western Europe (about 80,000 people), but also the majority of votes cast in three-quarters of all constituencies at home.
The Patriotic Electoral Bloc only came first in the traditionally pro-Russian north of the country, in the autonomous region of Gagauzia and among the relatively small number of voters from the separatist region of Transnistria.
Major defeat for the Kremlin
This means that the election result is first and foremost a major defeat for Russia and the Kremlin, which had invested heavily in a pro-Russian campaign.

Igor Grosu, who is both leader of PAS and parliamentary speaker, said on Monday morning: "Moldova, I salute you. You have won battle upon battle against enemies of this country, who seemed invincible. Russia threw everything dirty it had into the fight. Tons of money, lies, illegalities."
Grosu described the election outcome as a clear message that "we decide what happens in this country, not Russia," adding that "it's not only PAS that won the elections, the people won."


'Moldova 3, Putin 0'
One of PAS's most popular and senior candidates, Radu Marian, posted on Facebook: "Moldova 3, Putin 0 — Congratulations to the Moldovans!"
This was an allusion to the outcome not only of Sunday's parliamentary election, but also of the presidential election last November, which saw pro-European President, Maia Sandu, being re-elected, and of the EU referendum that was held on the same day, in which a slim majority voted in favor of the country's aim of joining the European Union.
In recent weeks and months, Moldova has been flooded with pro-Russian content on social media. Most of these were shared by the Patriotic Electoral Bloc, with many also being posted from unknown accounts.

In addition, fugitive Moldovan-Israeli businessman Ilan Shor, who has been convicted of stealing a billion dollars from the country's banking system, also organized an extensive campaign of vote-buying from his home in Moscow.

Training people to cause unrest
Again and again in recent weeks, coordinators of Shor's network have been arrested — most recently last week in the course of a major raid across the country in which large amounts of cash, propaganda material, fake ballots and weapons were seized.
The Moldovan and Serbian police forces also arrested people taking part in training camps in Serbia, where Moldovan and Romanian citizens were being trained in how to stage unrest in the run-up to the election.
Moldova's electoral commission also barred several pro-Russian parties from taking part in the election on the grounds of illegal campaign and party financing.
Two parties were barred only two days before the election, one of which was the pro-Russian Heart of Moldova (IM) party of Irina Vlah, a former governor of the autonomous region of Gagauzia, whose political leaders have close ties to the Kremlin.
Moldova's president: Uncharacteristically emotional message
Moldovan President Maia Sandu spoke to voters in an uncharacteristically emotional way after casting her vote on Sunday, among other things posting a video on Facebook in which she said: "Russia is not our friend. It attacked a neighboring country without any reason, it turned off the gas taps for us and it wants to buy our votes and our country."

She later wrote on Facebook that "Moldova is our country, not that of Shor's criminal group."
The leader of the Patriotic Electoral Bloc alliance, Igor Dodon, declared late on Sunday that PAS had lost the election and called for protests on Monday to defend the "victory of the people over PAS."
By Monday midday, Dodon had made no further comment on the election result. Given that the outcome of the election was unexpectedly clear, observers do not expect any major protests or unrest in the coming days.
Mayor of Chisinau Ion Ceban simply wrote on Facebook: "We thank everyone. We respect the vote of the citizens!"
Speaking at a press conference, PAS leader and parliamentary speaker Igor Grosu defended the opposition's right to protest in public. He did, however, call on the Patriotic Electoral Bloc and fellow lawmaker Igor Dodon to protest peacefully and not to pay people to protest — something that has happened repeatedly in the past.

        <updated>2025-09-29T14:02:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Bernd the Bread has been an icon of German children's TV for 25 years. After a TV appearance on John Oliver's show, he's now gained new fans.

"This is all so pointless. My life is hell," says Bernd das Brot — Bernd the bread — one of Germany's most unusual children's TV characters.
For 25 years, the perpetually grumpy loaf of bread has wandered through children's television with world-weariness and dry quips. Now the sad loaf has gained viral appeal  in the US, after TV host John Oliver introduced the bad-tempered German character on his show, "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver."
Bernd embodies the stereotype of a humorless German who always has something to complain about, Oliver dryly observed: "That's the most German thing I've ever seen." The internet has lit up with enthusiasm for this "weird German bread."
US media outlet Voice of America described Bernd as "a depressed German loaf of bread" that has been "a TV cult classic for 25 years."


How did a loaf of bread become a cult figure in Germany?
The character first appeared in 2000 on the children's channel KiKA. His debut was in the show "Tolle Sachen," alongside cheerful characters Chili das Schaf, a sheep, and Briegel der Busch, a flowering bush.

In 2003, KiKA began showing short Bernd segments in its nightly loop during hours when regular programming was off the air. That move drew an adult audience and helped cement his status as a cult figure.
According to Tommy Krappweis, his creator, both children and adults can laugh at Bernd — though they tend to find different things funny.
In 2004, "Bernd das Brot" won the Adolf Grimme Prize — often regarded as Germany's equivalent of the Emmy Awards in the US. The jury said the "anti-fun" character has a right to be in a bad mood "in the midst of a garish fun-event culture of hyped-up mega-emotional shows."


What makes Bernd so special?
Bernd isn't mainstream by a long shot. While children's TV is usually colorful, cheerful and motivating, Bernd — a depressed loaf with a perpetually downcast mouth — trudges through absurd adventures. He just wants peace and quiet; and that's exactly what makes him funny. Fans love his stoic humor, his constant listlessness and his quirky friends. He's an honest bread who just wants to be left to wallow in his world-weariness.



Why is he so sad?
So just why is he so down in the dumps? He apparently attempted to be a mascot for a bakery's advertising campaign and failed.
But that's not all. In episode 85 of the children's series, Bernd tells Chili and Briegel he once fell in love with a "beautiful, slim baguette." But she only had eyes for a "run-of-the-mill multigrain bread with its 10 types of grain," which left Bernd bitter. "Since then, my heart is a dry lump of flour."
But Tommy Krappweis, co-creator of "Bernd das Brot," has made clear that this love affair isn't the real cause of Bernd's perpetual gloom. Rather, Bernd is depressed by his own existence and the circumstances of his creation. He believes his life is essentially meaningless. His main activities are staring at walls and putting up with his annoyingly cheerful friends.
So Bernd remains what he is: a grumpy loaf who has unintentionally won hearts — in Germany, online, and now also among US audiences.
During his appearance with John Oliver, Bernd bid farewell to the audience with the line: "My life is hell." With this, he left a lasting impression and gained thousands of new fans — despite himself.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Despite progress in climate change action, Europe's environment is being seriously degraded, according to a new report. Researchers say environmental damage threatens competitiveness and quality of life on the continent.
    Biodiversity loss and ecosystem decline are expected to continue Image: Andreas Vitting/imageBROKER/picture alliance   
Europe’s environment is struggling, according to a report released Tuesday by the European Environment Agency (EEA).  
The report found that nature in Europe is facing levels of degradation, overexploitation and biodiversity loss that pose a direct threat to European stability, security and living standards.  
Released every five years by the Copenhagen-based EU agency, the report is the most comprehensive assessment of the environment, climate and sustainability in the region.  
Despite progress in areas such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the ramping up of renewable energy, the report found that the overall state of Europe's environment is "not good".  
EU officials said the report was a stark reminder of the importance of maintaining and strengthening green policies and ambitions.  
"Delaying or postponing our climate targets would only increase costs, deepen inequalities and weaken our resilience," said Teresa Ribera, the European Commission's executive vice president for "a clean, just and competitive transition." She said protecting nature was an investment in competitiveness and the well-being of people in Europe.

Biodiversity and ecosystem decline set to continue 
Unsustainable production and consumption patterns driven by the food system are leading to a decline in biodiversity across land and water in Europe. An estimated 80% of protected habitats are in a poor or bad state, and 60-70% of soils are degraded.  


This downward trend is on track to continue, with the report stating that the EU's nature restoration targets for 2030 were unlikely to be met. 
Water resources in the European Union are also under "severe pressure," with water stress currently affecting about one-third of Europe and only 37% of surface water bodies maintaining positive ecological status. Agriculture was responsible for much of this degradation, with fertilizer and pesticides affecting water quality and leading to a loss of aquatic life. 
The European Union’s "carbon sink" has also declined by about 30% over the past decade because of factors such as more frequent and widespread tree logging, intense wildfires and droughts.  
Carbon sinks such as forests and oceans are important in the fight against climate change as they draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Climate change an urgent challenge 
The impacts of accelerating climate change remain an "urgent challenge," according to the report.   
Europe is the fastest-warming continent on the planet, with temperatures increasing at double the global average rate. Amid record breaking heat waves this summer, countries across the continent battled intense wildfires, which burned through more than 1 million hectares (2.4 million acres) of land. 
Though Europe has made strides in reducing greenhouse gases by 37% compared with 1990 and doubling renewable energy in electricity generation, transport emissions have only marginally reduced. Much of the sector remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels.  
Reductions have been similarly limited in agriculture, which contributes 93% of the European Union’s ammonia air emissions and is the biggest cause of pollinator decline and soil degradation.

Protecting nature key to economy and security  
The report stresses throughout that natural resources provide the bedrock for Europe’s economic prosperity, with close to three-quarters of businesses being "critically dependent" on ecosystem services such as water supply and healthy soils.  
"We need to rethink the link between the environment and the economy and look at the protection of nature as an investment, not a cost," said Jessika Roswall, the EU commissioner for environment, water resilience and a competitive crircular economy. "Healthy nature is the basis for a healthy society, a competitive economy and a resilient world." 
The report found that decarbonizing the economy, shifting towards a circular economy low in waste, reducing pollution and more responsible management of natural resources is urgently needed. Protecting nature will also help ensure vital aspects of European well-being such as food security and clean drinking water.  
Green jobs, innovation and sustainable finance were all highlighted as potential ways of securing progress and grounds for optimism. The report found that more investment in the green transformation of industry could lead to Europe's becoming a global leader in developing technologies to decarbonize highly polluting industries such as steel and cement.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[As costly artificial intelligence data centers get built in rich countries, there's concern that many countries will be left behind. But Armenia is poised to get a boost from Nvidia's plans for a $500 million AI factory.

Hankavan is about an hour's drive from Armenia's capital, Yerevan, and is known for its campgrounds. Every summer, all kinds of programs draw students here. During the last week of August, more than 100 young people came for something new: learning about career paths in artificial intelligence (AI).
A nonprofit called the Foundation for Armenian Science and Technology organized the camp as part of its efforts to get young Armenians ready for tech jobs. On the last day of the program, Armenian tech professionals sat in circles with high school students from all over the country to share advice.

One of the day's speakers, a researcher and software engineer named Tigran Ishkhanyan, said the new AI data center will be a boon for Armenia, particularly youths like the students at the camp.
"[The] Nvidia AI factory will be a game changer, for sure, because they will need a lot of professionals and, of course, first of all they will try to hire someone from Armenia," he said.
Competitive advantage
Nvidia has announced it is partnering with a small US-based firm called Firebird and Armenia's government to launch a $500 million (€426.5 million) AI factory next year. The specific location of the center is yet to be announced. It is set to use thousands of microchips known as graphics processing units, or GPUs.
Nvidia and Armenia's Ministry of High-Tech Industry declined interview requests, and Firebird did not respond.
Rev Lebaredian, Nvidia's vice president, recently predicted that "everyone" around the world will eventually have basic infrastructure for AI.
In a podcast, he compared the technology to the advent of electricity, noting it was confined to just a few places before spreading all over. But until AI similarly becomes ubiquitous, the new data center will give Armenia a big competitive advantage, Lebaredian said.
"What we're building with this supercomputer isn't just another business," he said in June. "This is going to be a generator for basic research that will then turn into companies that will grow and become a big part of the economy and turn Armenia into a significant player in technology on the global stage." 

The top Nvidia executive also explained how an AI factory works, saying the new facility will take in tons of data, rapidly crunch it using Nvidia Blackwell GPUs, and put out so-called tokens containing condensed information for all kinds of applications.
"The more tokens you can produce, the more efficient you are, the more value you create," Lebaredian added.

AI's winners and losers
Most of the expensive AI factories are built in rich countries, such as the United States, the European Union and China.  A 2024 United Nations report expressed growing concern that countries with fewer resources will be left behind.
Huge data centers have been powering AI research, costing billions of dollars and sparking competition to acquire GPUs. The chips are notorious for consuming huge amounts of electricity and requiring vast amounts of water to stay cool.

AI and its impact on the environment

Experts warn that the growth of AI might create a new digital divide that repeats the inequities of colonialism.
"As the global economy increasingly shifts towards AI-driven production and innovation, less developed countries risk being left further behind, exacerbating economic and social divides," states the UN report compiled by the Office of the Secretary-General's Envoy on Technology.
Nvidia's plans would make Armenia — which has about 3 million residents and is still reeling from its recent wars with neighboring Azerbaijan— the only country in the region to boast an AI factory.
According to Lebaredian, the new facility will tap surplus electrical supply from the country's only nuclear power plant.


Local tech boom
Lebaredian is based in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to his LinkedIn profile. People in Armenia credit Armenian expats like him with helping to create the country's tech sector in recent years.
Experts say another factor behind Armenia's tech boom is a simple necessity. The country is a bit smaller than Belgium and has few natural resources. That means more and more investors and educators here have been turning to tech.
There are more than 1,200 tech companies in Armenia, and they had $2.3 billion in turnover last year, according to a recent study by Armenian nonprofit Bootcamps.
The figures cover a mix of homegrown businesses and local outposts of foreign firms, some of which reportedly moved here from Russia to get around Western sanctions imposed on Russia due to itsinvasion of Ukraine.
Some of the future workers at Nvidia's AI factory seem likely to come out of the after-school programs at Armenia's Tumo Center for Creative Technologies.

On a recent visit to Tumo's headquarters in the capital Yerevan, dozens of students were spread out and either doing self-study at clusters of computers or learning from instructors in classrooms. In one room, a 12-year-old was doing a one-on-one session about robotics with a veteran educator and a mini robot rolling around a table.
Pegor Papazian, Tumo's chief development officer, told DW that he and other tech leaders in Armenia have been involved in conversations about establishing the new AI factory.
"We were invited by the Firebird team to pitch a couple of ideas on how we would use free computing if it was available to us for educational, academic research purposes," he said. "It looks like we will be able to benefit directly."
Tumo has proposed projects, including a study of student behavior data to personalize learning paths, and a study focusing on Armenian architecture, according to Papazian.
On the last day of the Hankavan camp, the talks on AI careers lasted into the evening.
Viktoria Melkonyan, a 16-year-old who studies IT, voiced high hopes for the new factory.
"It is very surprising that they invested such big money to build servers," she told DW. "I think this investment from Nvidia to Armenia will be a great… to show the world that Armenia is not falling behind, but we are catching up and we are also pushing others further."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[According to a new FIFPRO report, Morocco and Paris Saint-Germain star Achraf Hakimi is a footballer at his limit, having had a season that lasted nearly a whole year.

The international football player union FIFPRO reviewed how much players are playing, releasing its finidings in a report published on Monday.
Moroccan star Achraf Hakimi, as a result of his treble-winning season with PSG and his commitments with the national team, has been under extreme physical strain.
Last season, Hakimi, 26, played 69 matches, accumulating 6,371 minutes. This was a noticeable increase from his previous season, when he played 53 games and 4,869 minutes for club and country.
Hakimi was not alone in playing 69 games in the last campaign. Bayern Munich's Joshua Kimmich played the same number of matches and almost the same number of minutes, and every member of the top 10 on the FIFPRO list easily surpassed the recommended limit of 55 matches per season.
Hakimi's 2024-25 season started in Paris, representing his country at the Olympics (July 24 to August 8, 2024), and ended with the Club World Cup (June 15 to July 13, 2025). This meant his season lasted nearly an entire year, and his offseason was just 22 days.
The medical consensus regarding rest periods and season breaks is that players should be guaranteed four weeks between seasons with no commitments. There should also be a minimum four-week retraining period after an offseason break before starting with competition. Sadly, the two are less and less common at the highest level of modern football.

Even more games ahead
This season, Hakimi is on course, should PSG advance to the knockouts of the Champions League and Morocco do well at both the African Cup of Nations and the 2026 World Cup, to play 74 matches, which is nearly 7,000 minutes.
"People need to understand we're not machines. To deliver the level of play fans want — intense, competitive matches — we also need time to rest," Barcelona and France defender Jules Kounde said.
Hakimi's situation isn't new either. Earlier in the year, Bayern Munich's Kim Min-jae was also the subject of interest after his schedule became untenable.
Hakimi has been pushing the limits of his capacity even before he turned 21. In the FIFPRO report, one of the major fears is the lack of protection currently around young players. Constant competition demands make young players more susceptible to long-term risks than older players, highlighting the real need for safeguards.
The number of minutes Moroccan players have played before turning 21 has risen dramatically in recent years. Before Hakimi turned 21, he had played over 10,000 minutes for club and country. Hakim Ziyech, Hakimi's national team teammate from 2016 to 2024, hadn't even played for Morocco and had played just over 3,000 minutes at club level before turning 21. Bilal El Khannouss, who plays in the Bundesliga for Stuttgart, accumulated even more playing time before turning 21, reaching 10,628 minutes for club and country.
Morocco clearly has many exciting young footballers, but managing their playing load will be key to their longevity in the game.


Hope for more action as legal battle begins
In the modern football calendar, players continue to be pushed not just to their limit but beyond it. Hakimi is one of the stars of the modern game and a leading player not just for the country of Morocco but also for the continent of Africa. If his form starts to dip or injuries start to become regular, then Hakimi's playing load will be one of the places to look.
Failure to better manage player workload is costing every stakeholder in football. FIFPRO have launched legal action against FIFA over the schedule, but if nothing changes soon then those who make the "beautiful game" possible will remain at risk.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[A report from the global football player union highlights concerns about player load and heat leading up to next summer's World Cup.

A FIFPRO report on the 2024-25 football season highlights concerns over the amount of football players in the men's game are playing. Key findings cover several areas of concern, perhaps most notably continued calendar congestion and extreme heat.
The 32-team Club World Cup put an enormous strain on the players, with some, such as Achraf Hakimi, having their seasons stretch over almost an entire year as a result.
The report notes that Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Bayern Munich all had their off-seasons and preseasons for the current campaign severely shortened because of the competition. Without improved safeguarding and better load management, there is concern that the participation of many players at the 2026 World Cup is at risk.
The FIFPRO report founds that the consensus of medical experts is that competition regulations should include a minimum of four weeks between seasons and a minimum of two days between appearances to allow for adequate recovery, and that the increased burden of travel should be considered when scheduling fixtures.
"You've got the perfect storm of how not to treat a human," FIFPRO consultant Dr. Darren Burgess told journalists in a media call to present the report. 
"You've got players playing a large number of games followed by fewer than the recommended off-season days and preseason days followed by a large number of games again," he said. "The cycle keeps repeating."
"This leads to injury at worst and at best reduced capacity to perform," he said.


Heat a concern
One of the other major concerns in the report was heat, which was highlighted for the first time five years after FIFPRO started delivering these annual reports.
"This year, with the impact at the Club World Cup, and the pathway towards the World Cup in the US, it felt necessary to include it in the report this year," FIFPRO Director of Policy and Strategic Relations Alexander Bielefeld said.
"The risk to player health is clearly rising," he added.
Using the Club World Cup as a case study, the report found that four games in the United States reached a temperature above 28 degrees Celsius WetBulb Globe Temperature (82 degrees Fahrenheit WBGT), which under FIFPRO guidelines meant they should have been postponed. A further 17 games saw temperatures that were close to the cancellation threshold.
"This is an issue that affects a lot of different playing markets in the context of a warming planet," according to the report. "The Club World Cup was a wake-up call in this regard and a bad example of how to properly deal with the circumstances."
On one occasion, Borussia Dortmund had their substitutes sit inside because temperatures outside were too high.


"The harder and longer athletes play, the greater their heat exposure, increasing risks from fatigue and dizziness to heat stroke and long-term illnesses," Manal Azzi, an occupational health and safety expert for the International Labor Organization, told FIFPRO.
According to the FIFPRO report, six of the 16 host cities for the World Cup face conditions classified as "extreme risk" for heat-related illness, which is a concern for players and fans. With 48 teams involved across three countries with three varied climates, increased fatigue is a serious risk.
This matter is made more complicated by US President Donald Trump, who recently said he would move matches from host cities he deemed too dangerous, charging that San Francisco and Seattle were "run by radical left lunatics."
What happens next?
With FIFPRO currently engaged in legal action against FIFA for the congested nature of the calendar and voices from the playing group growing even louder, there is hope that tangible change is on the way. The players' union believes that years of accumulated data gives more weight to their arguments, and that there is a real sense in the game that no one disputes that load management is an issue.
"There is a significant shift in the discourse," Bielefeld said. "This is not sufficient. We need urgent action, but we are in a very different space than we were two-three years ago."
"We will keep fighting for the best possible outcome on this issue and many other issues," Alexander Phillips, FIFPRO's secretary general said.
"But they all boil down to the same issue," he said, "which is that the system is not working"
In the meantime, football's schedule rolls on and the World Cup looms large. With 48 teams and 104 games, it will be the biggest edition of the competition ever. Fans can only hope that next summer, the best players in the world will be fit and healthy enough to take part.

 Russia pulls out of European anti-torture convention
    
Russia has denounced the European anti-torture convention and announced its exit from the agreement, which aims to strengthen the rights of persons deprived of their liberty and empowers monitors to visit prisons and detention centers.
On Monday, Russia's President Vladimir Putin signed a law to that effect.
The decision comes after international watchdogs like the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have repeatedly criticized alleged human rights violations by Russian authorities during Moscow's offensive in Ukraine.
Russia's Foreign Ministry said last month that pulling out of the convention would not "harm" Russian citizens and that Russia "remains committed to its international human-rights obligations."
But two UN special rapporteurs said earlier this month the move to pull out of the treaty "raises red flags about what is going on behind bars" in Russian jails.

 Putin orders drafting of 135,000 more men into military service
    
Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree ordering the call-up of 135,000 more men aged between 18 and 30 for military service.
It marks the country's biggest autumn conscription drive since 2016.
The conscripts are expected to serve for a year at a military base inside Russia.
They're not supposed to be deployed for fighting in Ukraine, although there have been reports of conscripted men being sent to the front line.
The annual conscription campaigns are unrelated to mobilization, in which Russian men are drafted to fight during wartime.
But conscripts who have completed military training are more likely to be called up to fight in the future.

 Ukrainian journalist Maksym Butkevych wins Vaclav Havel Prize

The Council of Europe has awarded the prestigious Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize to Ukrainian journalist and human rights activist Maksym Butkevych.  
"I dare to say that I participate in this ceremony, and I receive this honorable award not only in my personal capacity, but on behalf of Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilians illegally detained by Russia," Butkevych said at the award ceremony in the French city of Strasbourg.
Butkevych is co-founder of the Zmina Human Rights Center and Hromadske Radio.
At the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he volunteered for service in the Ukrainian army despite his pacifist beliefs.
He was taken as a prisoner of war by Russia and remained in captivity for more than two years.
Butkevych was released around a year ago as part of a prisoner exchange.

 Hungary blocks 12 Ukrainian news sites

Hungary has said it blocked access to 12 Ukrainian news websites following a similar move by Kyiv.
"A sovereign country must give a proportional response to an entirely unjustified attack," Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas said in a Facebook post, announcing the measure.
The move comes after Ukraine earlier this month blocked various websites deemed to contain pro-Russian views at the request of the security services.
They included eight Hungarian-language portals, among them a popular pro-government news site origo.hu.
The websites now targeted by Hungary are widely read in Ukraine.
One, European Pravda, closely tracks Ukraine's EU accession aspiration and Hungary's efforts to block that.
Hungary's decision marks a further slump in ties between the two neighbors.
Their relations have been fraught since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, as Hungarian PM Orban has maintained close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and been skeptical about Western military aid for Kyiv.

 Two killed in Ukrainian drone attack near Moscow, Russia says
    
A Ukrainian drone attack has killed two people on the outskirts of Moscow, Andrei Vorobyov, governor of the Moscow region, said on social media.
"Last night, air defense forces shot down four drones in Voskresensk and Kolomna," two cities southeast of Russia's capital, he posted on Telegram.
"Unfortunately, a tragedy occurred in Voskresensk: two people died in a fire in a private home — a 76-year-old woman and her 6-year-old grandson," he added.
Overall, the Russian military said it had intercepted 78 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory overnight, most of them over the border regions of Bryansk and Belgorod.
It came a day after a massive Russian drone and missile attack against Ukraine, involving nearly 600 drones and 48 missiles. Most of them were reportedly shot down by Ukrainian air defenses.

 'We will not be lured into Putin's trap,' says German defense minister
   
Dmytro Hubenko
   
Germany's Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has warned that Moscow is increasingly becoming a threat to NATO.
Russian President Vladimir Putin "deliberately attempts to undermine European security and the territorial integrity of European nations," he said addressing participants at the Warsaw Security Forum in Polish capital.
"He seeks to provoke NATO member states. He wants to expose vulnerabilities within our alliance," the minister said, adding that NATO has "responded to Russia's provocations with clarity, unity, resolve, and prudence."
"We will not be lured into Putin's trap of continuous escalation. We are keeping a cool head while remaining steadfast and determined," Pistorius stressed.

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has warned that any war with Europe could escalate into a conflict with weapons of mass destruction.
"They simply cannot afford a war with Russia," he said of European powers, adding that "the possibility of a fatal accident always exists."
"And such a conflict has an absolutely real risk of escalating into a war using weapons of mass destruction," Medvedev, who is now deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, wrote on Telegram.

 Russia's Belgorod working to restore power, governor says
    
The governor or Russia's Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said Ukrainian missile strikes overnight had caused power outages and injured at least three civilians in the region.
He added that authorities were working to restore power and hot water.
There was no immediate comment from Ukraine.
Gladkov said Kyiv's forces had shelled other parts of the region, which borders Ukraine, and had launched at least 76 attack drones in the last 24 hours.
The Russian Defense Ministry said it had shot down 21 Ukrainian drones over Belgorod overnight.

 Germany's Pistorius talks defense in Warsaw
    
German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is participating in the Warsaw Security Forum on Monday, where he will take part in high-level talks focusing on European security.
Alongside Pistorius, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans and Estonia's Hanno Pevkur were both due to take part in the talks, as well as European Commissioner for Defense and Space Andrius Kubilius.
Pistorius will then travel on to Lithuania, where Germany is deploying a combat brigade to assist with the defense of NATO's eastern flank. The unit, comprising around 4,800 soldiers and 200 civilian personnel, is expected to be fully operational by 2027.

 EU hails parliamentary election results in Moldova
    
The president of the European Council, Antonio Costa, has welcomed the outcome of Sunday's parliamentary elections in Moldova.
"The people of Moldova have spoken and their message is loud and clear. They chose democracy, reform and a European future, in the face of pressure and interference from Russia," he wrote on X. "The EU stands with Moldova. Every step of the way."
European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen congratulated the Moldovan people and said: "No attempt to sow fear or division could break your resolve."
"You made your choice clear: Europe. Democracy. Freedom. Our door is open. And we will stand with you every step of the way. The future is yours," she wrote on X.
Moldova's ruling pro-EU party won the elections with the backing of more than half of voters, according to near-complete results on Monday. The polls were overshadowed by accusations of Russian interference in the former Soviet republic.

 Zelenskyy proposes joint aerial shield with European allies
    
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on his European partners to join forces to create a joint aerial defense shield to protect themselves against threats from Russia.
"Ukraine proposes to Poland and all our partners to build a joint fully reliable shield against Russian aerial threats," he said in an address to the Warsaw Security Forum delivered via video link.
"This is possible. Ukraine can counter all kinds of Russian drones and missiles and if we act together in the region we will have enough weapons and production capacity."
NATO leaders have said that Moscow has been testing the alliance's readiness and resolve with airspace incursions in Poland and the Baltic states.

 German foreign minister says no NATO member will be left alone

Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said no NATO member state would be left to fend for themselves when dealing with what he called Russian provocations.
"Russia wants to test our resolve and to stir unrest. That is dangerous and must be answered clearly and with unity," Wadephul said during a press conference in Warsaw with his Polish and French counterparts Radoslaw Sikorski and Jean-Noel Barrot.
NATO would "protect every inch of our alliance territory — no member state is left alone to deal with these threats," he added.
Prior to leaving for Warsaw, the minister had called for a decisive and well-considered response to Moscow's actions.
"We are standing together, keeping a cool head and not allowing ourselves to be driven into an escalation," he said, referring to  Russian drone incidents in Poland and Denmark.
"At the same time, we are leaving no doubt that we are determined and ready to fend off any threat together," Wadephul said.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The European Broadcasting Union will have its members vote on Israel's participation after calls to exclude the country over the war in Gaza.

Will Israel be allowed to participate in the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest? 
Following calls to have the country excluded over the war in Gaza, the question will be answered in November.
The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which runs the event, confirmed on Friday that it would let its 68 members "vote on participation in the Eurovision Song Contest 2026," by holding a digital general assembly in early November.
"Given that the Union has never faced a divisive situation like this before, the Board agreed that this question merited a
Kronen Zeitung.
The EBU later clarified to press agency Reuters that the vote is on the participation of Israeli public broadcaster, KAN.
On Thursday, Kan, the Israeli broadcaster, wrote on X that it hoped the contest "will continue to uphold its cultural and non-political identity."


"The potential disqualification of Israel's public broadcaster KAN — one of the contest's long-standing, popular and successful participants — would be especially concerning as we approach the 70th edition of the song contest, which was founded as a symbol of unity, solidarity and fellowship," the broadcaster added.


Are most countries for or against Israel's participation?
While KAN claims that an exceptional majority of 75% of the general assembly will be needed for such a decision, EBU spokesperson Dave Goodman stated that an "absolute majority" in the vote would allow an exclusion to
So far, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Iceland have officially announced they would boycott the event if Israel participates, while countries such as Germany and Austria have been supportive of Israel staying in. 
Austria, the host country for the 2026 edition, has slammed the boycott calls as "dumb and pointless,"  while Germany's Culture Minister Wolfram Weimer said that "excluding Israel today... turns a celebration of understanding between peoples into a tribunal."

Journalist Daniel Kähler, who has extensively covered the Eurovision Song Contest for Radio Bremen and ARD, is skeptical that a majority of the EBU members will vote against Israel's participation. "Many participating countries have not taken a clear stance for or against Israel's participation. So far, only a handful of officials have made their positions clear," Kähler told DW. "If the majority of EBU members vote in favor of an Israeli singer performing on the Eurovision stage — which I can definitely see happening — it might lead to fewer participating countries in Vienna. For instance, Spain and Ireland have clearly stated that they would not want to take part under such circumstances."
'One of the biggest crises' in Eurovision history
For Dean Vuletic, another expert on the history of the song contest, "This is one of the biggest crises that Eurovision has ever faced because it has the potential to really cement division within the organization," he told press agency AP. 
There have been exclusions in the past, noted Vuletic, including of the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s — due to United Nations sanctions as war in the Balkans was raging — and more recently those of Belarus in 2021 over a crackdown against media freedoms, and Russia in 2022 over its full-scale war in Ukraine.
But compared to the decision the event organizers now faces, the Belarus and Russia cases didn't spark "such strong divisions within the EBU," added Vuletic.

In September, a United Nations Commission of Inquiry concluded that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, accusations that Israel vehemently rejects.
There were already protests against Israel's participation in the competition due to the Gaza War during the past two events.
Despite the controversy surrounding the performance of Israel's candidate, Yuval Raphael, the artist secured second place overall and first place in the audience vote at the 2025 competition in Basel. JJ from Austria took first place, and as a result, the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest will be held in Vienna.

 Frankfurt man finds winning lottery ticket in jacket pocket as weather turns cold
    
A German man who donned a jacket stored away since March got the surprise of his life over the weekend.
The family father from Frankfurt had forgotten a lotto ticket in the pocket of the jacket when he put it away for the summer. He didn't discover the ticket again until the weather turned chilly. 
"It wasn't until the weekend that I found the ticket again, folded up in the inside pocket of my jacket," the unidentified man was quoted as saying, adding, "When I checked the numbers on my phone and saw the winning amount, I was completely shocked — luckily I was sitting down, otherwise my knees would have given way."
The winning amount was €15.3 million ($18 million).
Lotto Frankfurt, which initiated a PR campaign searching for the lucky winner earlier this year, said the man had remained oblivious to his good fortune despite having seen and heard the campaign to identify the winner.
"I heard about it on the radio at the time and thought to myself, 'How stupid can you be to not collect it?' It never occurred to me that I could be the person they were looking for," the winner said.
When asked what he planned to do with his winnings, the man said he wanted to buy a new sofa for his living room.
Beyond that, he and his wife — who wish to remain anonymous — said they plan to use the bulk of the money to provide for their children.

 Night trains between Paris, Berlin and Vienna to be cancelled
    
Sleeper train service between the French, German and Austrian capitals will cease on December 14. The termination of the highly popular routes is the result of French subsidy cuts. 
The Paris-Vienna and Paris-Berlin routes were relaunched in 2021 and 2023 as part of a broader effort to bring night trains back as a low-emission alternative to short-haul flights inside Europe.
Though they averaged roughly 70% occupancy, according to the French state rail provider SNCF, this format is less lucrative in terms of how much money a seat or cabin can generate along the route. For instance, one seat can be booked several times during daytime travel, with passengers exiting and entering the train for various segments along the way — something that is not possible on sleeper trains.
Higher staffing requirements and locomotive changes at border crossings further weigh upon profits for SCNF and their operating partners at Germany's DB and Austria ÖBB.
SNCF on Monday said service would not be economically viable after the French government announced the end to some €10 million ($11.7 million) in annual subsidies.
Adding to the inherent economic pressure of operating such trains was the fact that service was repeatedly interrupted by construction on French and German rails, frustrating willing customers and dampening rider enthusiasm.
French lawmaker Brigitte Klinkert called the decision "unacceptable," saying that high passenger numbers show the "great interest of passengers in rail connections" between the France and neighboring Germany, adding, "These connections are a climate-friendly and efficient means of transport that attracts many travelers and is also a strong symbol of the cooperation and friendship between France and Germany."

 Four dead in apparent family murder-suicide
    
Police in Oldenburg in the northern German state of Lower Saxony said that they had recovered the bodies of four individuals from a family home in the city earlier Monday morning.
Authorities say it appears that a man killed his wife and then their two children before committing suicide.
Police released a statement announcing that they would not be providing further information about the killings at the moment out of respect for the family.

 German music organization sues OpenAI over alleged song lyric copyright breaches
    
Germany's music rights society Gema is suing OpenAI for damages, accusing the US company of reproducing copyrighted German song lyrics without permission.
The Munich Regional Court on Monday said it was "undisputed" that the company's ChatGPT was trained on the nine song lyrics at issue in the case, noting the chatbot reproduced large parts of them verbatim when prompted.
Gema filed the lawsuit in November 2024 seeking an injunction, disclosure and compensation. It argues that OpenAI systematically used its repertoire to train generative AI systems, calling the memorization and reproduction of lyrics an unlawful reproduction under copyright law.
A verdict is scheduled for November 11.

 Court upholds surveillance of AfD in Hesse as suspected extremist case
    
The German state of Hesse's Office for the Protection of the Constitution may classify and monitor the Alternative for Germany (AfD) state branch as a suspected right-wing extremist organization, the Hesse Higher Administrative Court in Kassel ruled, the court announced.
The state intelligence agency made the designation about three years ago, and the Wiesbaden Administrative Court confirmed in 2023 that the AfD could be observed.
Judges said there are "factual indications" the party pursues goals hostile to Germany’s democratic order, including promoting an "ethnic concept of the people" and statements that violate the dignity of foreigners, particularly asylum seekers.
The Kassel court's decision is final, though a constitutional complaint remains possible.
The AfD said it will continue legal action, stressing that the ruling came in an expedited procedure. "After the decision in the interim proceedings, the main proceedings will now go before the Wiesbaden Administrative Court," a party statement said, adding it does not find the reasoning for the suspected-case classification convincing.

 Rheinmetall to supply €444 million in artillery shells via US contract
    
Europe's largest ammunition maker Rheinmetall will produce about €444 million (about $520 million) worth of artillery rounds for an unnamed Eastern European country under a US government contract, the Düsseldorf-based company said Monday.
Rheinmetall is acting as a subcontractor to US firm Global Military Products. Around €170 million of the order is already booked, with the remaining €274 million confirmed. Deliveries are scheduled to start in 2026 and finish by June 2027.
The company, which has previously supplied Ukraine, is expanding capacity to meet surging demand triggered by Russia's war on Ukraine and aims to produce up to 1.5 million 155 mm shells a year by 2027.

 Man rips Lederhosen in late-night Volksfest incident
   
Dmytro Hubenko
   
Police said a 47-year-old French national tore the leather shorts (Lederhosen) of a 40-year-old German man at Bad Cannstatt station around 12:30 a.m. on Saturday after visitors left the first day of Stuttgart's Cannstatter Volksfest.
The suspect allegedly yanked at the victim's Lederhosen until they ripped. Police officers found the intoxicated man on the platform and began an investigation for property damage.
The Cannstatter Volksfest is widely considered to be the second-largest beer celebration in the world.

 Man dies after mass brawl in Gelsenkirchen
    
A 56-year-old man has died from stab wounds following a violent clash involving up to 30 people in the western German city of Gelsenkirchen, police say. Three others remain in critical condition.
The fight erupted Sunday in the city's Bismarck district, where knives, stun guns and baseball bats were reportedly used in what police described as a "riot situation."
A homicide squad is investigating.
Three men aged 16, 29 and 52 and three women aged 25, 28 and 50 have been detained, while authorities work to determine each person's role and the motive behind the confrontation.
Police cordoned off the area to collect evidence and deployed a helicopter during the evening search for suspects.

 Man with knife detained after trying to steal sausage
    
Police in the northern German city of Rostock have detained a 19-year-old Ukrainian after a series of knife-related thefts and threats.
Authorities say the man stole kitchen knives from a TK Maxx store Saturday morning, then used one to rob an e-cigarette shop and threaten bystanders. He later demanded a bratwurst at knife point and fled when refused.
Officers arrested him and recovered the stolen goods nearby. They ordered a blood test, citing signs of alcohol and drug use.
Prosecutors charged the man with aggravated robbery, attempted extortion, threats and theft. A court issued a detention order Sunday, and he was taken to a correctional facility.

Lufthansa on Monday confirmed reports that it intends to cut 4,000 administrative positions by 2030.
The airline group said the cuts were part of moves to digitize, automate and consolidate processes.
The measures aim to "position the group for the future" while generating "sustainably attractive returns for shareholders," it said.
The Lufthansa Group, which, alongside its core brand, also operates SWISS, Austrian and Brussels Airlines and holds a minority stake in Italy's ITA, most recently had around 103,000 employees. 
Lufthansa said it also plans to put its various airlines under tighter central control in a bid to boost profitability.
Among other things, it says it will strengthen the low-cost carrier Eurowings and the logistics and maintenance units, with the latter expected to expand into the defense sector.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is visiting Poland on Monday amid growing tensions surrounding ongoing alleged provocations by Russia, including recent violations of NATO airspace.  
Wadephul was first meeting with his counterparts Radoslaw Sikorski from Poland and Jean-Noel Barrot of France for talks in the so-called Weimar Triangle format.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha is also expected to join the meeting.
Later, Wadephul will give a speech on European security and deterrence capabilities at a security forum.
The visit comes two and a half weeks after Russian drones entered NATO member Poland's airspace during one of Moscow's strikes on neighboring Ukraine.
Some of the drones were shot down by the Polish Air Force and other NATO allies.
Ahead of the trip, Wadephul said that while Poland and Germany were not going to allow themselves to be forced into any escalation, "we are leaving no doubt that we are determined and ready to fend off any threat together."

The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has failed to take town halls in Sunday's three runoff mayoral elections in Germany's most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia. 
Candidates from the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) beat their AfD opponents in the cities of Gelsenkirchen and Duisburg, while the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) of Chancellor Friedrich Merz won in Hagen.
According to preliminary state results, however, the AfD almost tripled its share of votes in councils and district councils to 14.5%, which put it in third place behind the SPD on 22.1%.
Almost 150 runoff elections were held on Sunday two weeks after local elections, including several mayoral contests and duels for district administrator offices.
The runoffs elections became necessary in cases where no candidate received more than 50% in the first round, with a simple majority sufficient to win in the second round.

Runoff elections in Germany's most-populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) have been topmost in many people's minds. The failure of candidates from the far-right AfD to win mayoral contests in three major cities has come as a relief to those who fear that the party represents a danger to democracy.
Chancellor Friedrich Merz is set to travel to Düsseldorf to celebrate his Christian Democratic Union's (CDU) win in the NRW capital city.
In other news, Germany's national carrier Lufthansa is planning to slash 4,000 administrative positions over the next five years.
Meanwhile, Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine continues to dominate the agenda for European countries including Germany. Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is in Poland to meet with his French and Polish counterparts to discuss measures in face of growing alleged provocations from Moscow.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The former mayor of Kherson, Volodymyr Mykolaienko, was held captive for three years before being released in a prisoner exchange. He spoke to DW about the occupation of his city, and surviving imprisonment in Russia.

Sixty-two years old at the time, Volodymyr Mykolaienko joined his local territorial defense force on the day Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. His hometown of Kherson, where he served as mayor from 2014 to 2020, was captured by Russian troops within weeks. The following month, soldiers arrested Mykolaienko on the street. He was interrogated, tortured, and taken as a prisoner to occupied Crimea, then on to a penal colony in Russia.
Kherson remained under occupation for nine months, until Ukrainian troops liberated the city in November 2022. Mykolaienko spent more than three years in captivity before he was able to return to Ukraine as part of a prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia on August 24, 2025. Grateful Ukrainians lined the roadside as Mykolaienko and others were driven home.
DW: Mr. Mykolaienko, you're currently undergoing rehabilitation in a hospital in Kyiv. How are you?
Volodymyr Mykolaienko: I'm still weak, but it's not too bad. The air of Ukraine, the love and respect of the Ukrainian people uplift me. When we saw the crowd — people standing at the roadside from the Ukrainian border practically to Chernihiv, greeting us with flags and home-made placards, children and elderly people among them — it's really a boost for your health; you feel such joie de vivre, love, and respect for these people and for Ukrainians in general.

There's  much debate about why the Russians were able to take Kherson so quickly in 2022, and why the Antonivskyi Bridge connecting the left and right banks of the Dnipro wasn't blown up by the Ukrainian army in order to prevent it. You were a witness to these events. When did you realize that there weren't many in the city who were prepared to resist?
When we heard shots being fired on the left bank, after literally just a few hours, we asked ourselves what had happened and why, and where the resistance was that our military had told the president was in place just one month, or three weeks, I think, before the start of the war. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had visited the troops to check our forces' preparedness. A sort of training exercise was carried out under the command of the Ukrainian security service. And all the military told him: "Mr President, the enemy won't get through here." It's obvious to me that there must have been treachery. Treachery by people in important positions in the region of Kherson.
Was it treachery committed by individuals? Or organized, premeditated action?
I think it was a Russian fifth column. It was done at the behest of the Russian Federation: Someone somewhere ordered a mine clearance. It's just not possible that Russian troops were on the outskirts of Kherson within a couple of hours. Why wasn't the Antonivskyi Bridge blown up?

You were held in different places for three years, in Crimea and in Russia. Were there different conditions in the various prisons?
Yes, absolutely. Borisoglebsk in the Russian region of Voronezh — that was absolute hell. It was a torture chamber from morning till night. You were beaten at morning inspection, then there was yard exercise, and on the way there you were beaten again. And they beat you again at the evening inspection. We were in Crimea for two days. That was a kind of model institution that (Russian Human Rights Commissioner) Tatyana Moskalkova liked to visit. She staged a show there: "Look, these are the conditions we hold Ukrainian prisoners in." There was a television, chess and other board games, books. We also had normal meals. In Pakino, on the other hand, we were tortured simply by being denied food.
You're known to have refused to be part of a prisoner exchange in 2022 so a seriously injured Ukrainian could take your place. How did the Russians react to that?
The Russians tried to bargain. They said: "We'll demand 20 of our boys for you." I said no. I would never have agreed to such an exchange. How could I look a wife or mother in the eye and say they'd handed over 20 men for me? Sorry, but who is this Mykolaienko for whom they have to hand over so much? We're all the same: a former mayor, a soldier, a brigadier. And you have to get the people most in need released first — which are the sick ones.

You hardly received any information while you were in captivity. What events in Ukraine did you only find out about when you were exchanged, on August 24, 2025?
First, I learned that my family was all right, that everyone's healthy and in good spirits. That was the most important thing for me. I asked what the current situation was, where the front line is. It was as I'd suspected. But I couldn't begin to imagine what had happened in my hometown of Kherson. That there were drones flying over it, hunting down and killing people. That there are some scumbags sitting there on the left bank whose main job is to learn how to kill people. They hunt down minibuses or particular individuals and claim: "There are no civilians there, only soldiers. If someone's walking around there in civilian clothes, they're a soldier who has to be killed." I don't understand why there isn't an outcry every day, all over the world. This is murder — the murder of civilians.
Did you know about the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia?
We were aware that a lot of people all got out at once, in April or May. Not from our camp, but we heard about it. In eight months, 78 people were able to leave our camp. We kept count of them; it was very important for us, and we were really happy for each one. I say that in all honesty. I realized that an exchange must be happening, so I thought that maybe at some point my turn would come. We talked about how Vladimir Putin wasn't going to give up his claim to the territories. Ninety-nine percent said they didn't want to be exchanged for territory. No Ukrainian territory should be surrendered for us.

What struck you on your return to Ukraine, and to what extent have Ukrainians been changed by the war?
I was proud of my nation: proud of the achievement of the Ukrainians who have been repelling this invasion for three and a half years. Now, I see different cases. I don't understand the men who aren't at the front right now. Who's going to defend your families? Why did I, an old man, set out with a machine gun to try and defend them? And young men are saying: "Oh — no." I know not everyone can fight. But help the troops, work behind the lines, volunteer. I think that right now the only thing that should matter is securing victory and independence for our country.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[A great unanswered question of the second Trump administration has been how its outright rejection of the existing global order would affect China’s international strategy. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called this order both “obsolete” and “a weapon being used against” the United States, and in his speech at the United Nations on September 23, President Donald Trump pilloried the “globalist” institution for “creating new problems for us to solve.” In the early months of this year, Beijing’s response to Washington’s attacks on the international order seemed mostly cautious and measured. China traded tit-for-tat tariffs with the United States, but it otherwise remained content to sit back and accrue benefits from Trump’s alienation of U.S. allies and withdrawal from international institutions. 
That period of caution is now over. Beijing has decided on a much more ambitious course, putting its plans on vivid display at a September meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. Hosting the once sleepy regional economic and security body, Chinese leader Xi Jinping clasped hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and met with 18 other leaders from across the Eurasian continent. A few days later, flanked by Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Xi presided over a massive military parade in Beijing to show off China’s fast-growing arsenal. Trump’s comment about seeing the summitry on TV—“They were hoping I was watching, and I was watching”—inadvertently revealed the precise position in which China hoped to place the United States: the American president, so often the prime mover of global politics, had become a spectator on the sidelines of a changing world.
Xi aims to establish China as the fulcrum of an emerging multipolar world, and he is advancing a new, more active diplomatic strategy to realize that goal. Rather than force the United States out of its leading position in the international system or overturn the existing order, China is exploiting Trump’s rapid, willing abdication of Washington’s role. And China is building up its own power and prestige within existing institutions, seeking to shift their centers of gravity irrevocably toward Beijing. If this gambit succeeds, it will transform the international order from the inside out, placing China at center stage and undermining U.S. influence in ways that future American administrations may find difficult to reverse.
WORLD BUILDING
Not too long ago, foreign policy analysts might have shrugged off the pageantry of the China summit. After all, meetings of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization are often heavy on optics and light on substance. Disagreements among the group’s key members, such as a long-running border dispute between China and India, have tended to outweigh their areas of commonality. Indeed, some commentators and U.S. officials dismissed the recent Chinese-hosted events as “performative,” “for show,” and merely a “photo op.”
Eight months into Trump’s second term, this reading is optimistic at best. It discounts the extent to which global reactions to Trump’s actions are reshaping the world. The international order that the United States built and maintained for decades is coming to an end, and what follows is up for grabs. Many countries are competing for influence, and short-term, transactional dealmaking rather than long-term cooperation is becoming the new norm, ushering in a phase that one of us called “mercenary multipolarity” in Foreign Affairs. The United States and China remain the two most powerful countries, but others, such as India and Russia, as well as the European Union, are significant players with their own agendas. And as U.S. alliances fracture under Trump, rivals of the United States are collaborating in increasingly meaningful ways.


Yet with the ultimate shape of this new order still undefined, Xi sees a window of opportunity to forge a China-centric world without directly taking on the United States by moving assertively into areas where Trump’s “America first” policies leave openings. This project extends well beyond the optics of gathering global leaders in Chinese cities. While the U.S. president feuded with the leaders of Brazil and India, Xi addressed a virtual BRICS meeting hosted by Brasilia on the topic of “resisting protectionism” and welcomed Modi to China to shore up ties with these two key powers. While Trump imposes tariffs on much of the world and eliminates U.S. foreign assistance, Xi is courting the leaders of the developing world: Beijing announced cuts to Chinese tariffs on African goods in June and claimed in September that it would bolster efforts to reform the World Trade Organization to benefit developing countries’ economic growth. While the Trump administration embraced unabashed technology nationalism, titling its AI action plan “Winning the Race,” China hosted its annual World Artificial Intelligence Conference under the headline “Global Solidarity in the AI Era,” claiming that Beijing wants to share the benefits of AI and announcing a new global AI governance project to do so. And whereas Trump attacked climate change as “the greatest con job ever” and skipped a UN summit on the issue, Xi has set an emissions reduction goal that, although remarkably unambitious, has earned him plaudits in some quarters. The list goes on.

 If China’s gambit succeeds, it will transform the international order.
Perhaps most worryingly for Washington, Xi’s actions have made clear that this China-centric world will reward resistance to the United States. There is no better symbol of this promise than Xi’s decision to give pride of place during the military parade in Beijing to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whose country has been under punishing sanctions for decades and has sent troops to fight in Russia’s war against Ukraine. Xi similarly embraced other leaders who have pushed back against the United States in some way: Putin, Modi, and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian all received a lavish welcome in China, too.
China is now focused on being seen not as a disrupter but as the defender of the international order, putting a new spin on its long-standing effort to secure a privileged position in existing institutions and to boost its capacity to set norms and rules inside them. Until recently, China preferred the safer course of criticizing unpopular U.S. policies and focusing its activities in areas that attract limited international attention, such as development, culture, and peacekeeping. But with a combative Trump questioning the very purpose of the UN at his speech before the General Assembly, Beijing has an international audience that may be more receptive to its overtures. “China has all along acted as a staunch defender of world peace and security,” Chinese Premier Li Qiang said at the UN just a few days after Trump’s speech.
In September, Xi announced his Global Governance Initiative, which aims to put China’s stamp on the United Nations system. It invokes the desire of many countries for a more “just and equitable” international order and makes China—rather than any other country or international body—the arbiter of what that new order will entail. Beijing is already advancing principles that work in its favor, such as an absolutist but selective conception of national sovereignty that it applies to itself but not to all countries, and marginalizing values that it sees as threatening, such as universal human rights. China has offered few details about how it would resolve disputes within or introduce reforms to international institutions, and it has no desire to foot more of the bill for costly UN programs. But given the disdain that the Trump administration has showed toward the UN, countries that are committed to the UN system may well accede to China’s entreaties to support its new initiative and its positions on a variety of substantive issues. Paired with prominent if modest Chinese investments in UN bodies and their personnel, Trump’s continued neglect, Xi hopes, will enable China to reshape these institutions to its liking.
As with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, analysts might once have rolled their eyes at the Global Governance Initiative as mere sloganeering. But it is one of a set of projects—including the Global Development Initiative, the Global Civilization Initiative, and the Global Security Initiative—that Chinese officials are working intently to translate into reality. The scholars Sheena Chestnut Greitens, Isaac Kardon, and Cameron Waltz recently found, for instance, that China’s internal security agencies have significantly increased their international policing partnerships and nonmilitary security cooperation under the banner of the Global Security Initiative, especially in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and the Pacific Islands but also in Africa and Latin America. As the United States steps back, China is quietly layering new kinds of partnerships on top of its already robust trade ties, with the aim that, over time, more countries will see Beijing—not Washington—as their most important relationship.
BUMPS IN THE ROAD
It is unrealistic to expect the Trump administration to suddenly change its approach to diplomacy and multilateralism or to see the wisdom of embracing allies and competing with China for influence at the UN. Such steps would have support among the American people, a strong majority of whom think that U.S. alliances benefit the United States and that the UN plays a necessary, if imperfect, role in the world. But these moves would simply be too much at odds with the administration’s “America first” ideology to gain traction. For the next few years, therefore, the United States is likely to leave China with an open field in international institutions.


Xi’s efforts may build additional momentum thanks to Trump’s approach to diplomacy with Beijing. Ahead of his planned visit to China in 2026, Trump is focused on the optics of his personal relationship with Xi and on striking a bilateral deal—which, if prior negotiations are any guide, much of the world may judge as a good deal for China, even if Trump touts it as a win. Other countries are watching these negotiations closely, and any agreement that appears to reward China’s resistance to U.S. demands will further entrench the view that China is gaining influence relative to the United States.
But China’s success is not a foregone conclusion. Beijing may struggle to translate its grand aspirations into a real global realignment. Many countries understand that a China-centric world would come with strings attached, and Beijing may be unable to resist escalating its numerous territorial disputes in Asia or flexing its coercive capabilities. Time and again over the past decade, Beijing’s actions—from punitive economic measures against major trading partners to maritime harassment of rival territorial claimants in the South China Sea—have invited pushback from countries that prize their autonomy. Now, those countries could resist China’s order-shaping efforts by reducing their reliance on both Beijing and Washington. A more fragmented, anarchic world is not necessarily one that China will dominate.
Missteps by China or resistance from other countries could well thwart Xi’s designs. For the United States, such setbacks can buy time—until different leadership in Washington once again has a vision of the future built around more than looking out for itself.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[It’s hard to imagine Washington taking a more heavy-handed response to the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for having led a coup to stay in office after his 2022 loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. U.S. President Donald Trump has characterized the conviction as a “witch hunt” and retaliated with a 50 percent tariff on many Brazilian goods. The U.S. Treasury Department has hit Alexandre de Moraes, the Brazilian Supreme Court justice overseeing Bolsonaro’s trial, with some of the harshest sanctions in the U.S. toolkit, including those intended for human rights abusers. 
Even U.S. military action against Brazil, which Trump designated a major non-NATO ally in 2019, appears to be on the table. When asked about the possibility of a Bolsonaro conviction, White House Press Secretary Karoline Levitt warned: “This is a priority for the administration, and the president is unafraid to use the economic might, the military might of the United States of America, to protect free speech around the world.” 
The harsh U.S. response to Bolsonaro’s prosecution represents a tremendous irony: the conviction resulted from the work of institutions that the United States fostered for decades by pushing for reforms to strengthen the independence of the Brazilian judiciary. Put simply, the Bolsonaro trial was a triumph of U.S. democracy promotion. 
At the moment, democracy promotion is anathema in Washington. The Trump administration has made unprecedented cuts to democracy, human rights, and governance programs, including dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development, slashing the State Department’s democracy bureau, and freezing nearly $5 billion in congressionally appropriated foreign assistance. Trump has said that “there’s no reason for USAID,” which he has called a “left-wing money-laundering scam.” These positions represent a wholesale retreat from the bipartisan post–Cold War liberal consensus positing that democracy promotion as a form of soft power could both benefit foreign countries and advance U.S. interests and principles. 
U.S. democracy promotion can rightly be criticized for its misplaced idealism and its excesses. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the George W. Bush administration tried to carry out nation building in Afghanistan and Iraq on a scale not seen since the aftermath of World War II. Bush’s disastrous campaign to democratize the Middle East soured the American public on such policies, which in turn allowed Trump to position himself as an opponent of democracy promotion and foreign assistance more broadly. And even in Latin America, U.S. democracy promotion has a checkered history, beginning with President Woodrow Wilson’s moralistic crusade to impose democracy on Mexico in 1914. 


After the Cold War, however, Washington embraced a softer and smarter approach in Latin America, nurturing fledgling democratic systems across the hemisphere by strengthening democratic governance, elections, human rights, and the rule of law, including reforming judicial institutions and criminal justice systems. Investing in that form of democracy promotion paid significant dividends in Brazil. But in the years to come, Trump’s abandonment of democracy promotion will make it harder for civil society and opposition parties to dislodge the autocratic forces that once again have begun to take root in Latin America. 
Judicial Review 
Historically, USAID was at the core of U.S. democracy promotion in Latin America, administering programs designed to strengthen democratic institutions, including by advising on elections, encouraging a free press, and promoting civic education. The agency also funded civil society groups working to expose and prevent corruption and increase government transparency. Less well known is the work of the National Endowment for Democracy, a quasi-autonomous agency whose government funding is currently in legal limbo. Created in 1983 by the Reagan administration, with an eye toward bringing change to the communist world, the NED has long enjoyed bipartisan support. 
In the 1980s and early 1990s, as countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay began to independently transition away from military dictatorship and toward democracy, the work of USAID and NED complemented U.S. counternarcotics programs, economic development assistance, humanitarian aid, and environmental protection. Throughout the 1990s, Washington prioritized judicial reforms intended to bolster the rule of law by training judges, prosecutors, and public defenders; helping law enforcement agencies build modern criminal investigative units; and offering fellowships for Latin American public servants to study at universities in the United States and intern at U.S. government agencies and nongovernmental organizations. 
The mission of strengthening the rule of law faced particular challenges in Brazil. The country has endured 14 military coups, from the 1889 coup that ended the monarchy and gave birth to the Republic of Brazil to Bolsonaro’s failed 2022 attempt to prevent Lula from taking power. Only half of these succeeded. But after almost every failed attempt, the coup plotters enjoyed amnesty, most famously in 1985, when Brazil underwent its last transition from dictatorship to democracy. 
Other Latin American countries that had suffered under military dictatorships vigorously prosecuted the perpetrators of human rights abuses, but Brazil did not follow suit. It instead swept the regime’s offenses under the rug, enacting a broad amnesty law in 1979 that was upheld by the Federal Supreme Court in 2010 and remains in place to this day. It was only in 2011 that Brazil organized a truth commission to chronicle human rights abuses the military committed between 1964 and 1985. 
Nonetheless, with help from the United States, Brazil made significant strides, mostly by enhancing the independence of its judiciary. Brazil’s Federal Supreme Court has taken dramatic steps to expand the rights of historically marginalized communities including Afro-Brazilians, indigenous people, and LGBTQ people. For example, when Brazil legalized gay marriage in 2013 (before the United States), the court noted that its intervention was needed given the lack of action from the Brazilian Congress. 

 The Bolsonaro trial was a triumph of U.S. democracy promotion. 
The strength of the judiciary has also enabled federal prosecutors to confront large scale corruption. In 2014, prosecutors launched Lava Jato, or Operation Carwash, a money-laundering investigation that exposed a host of criminal activities, including bribery, tied to Petrobras, the state-run oil company. The investigation became the biggest anticorruption dragnet in Brazilian history, leading to nearly 280 convictions and implicating top business people and politicians. It led to the imprisonment of the best-known of all Lava Jato defendants, President Lula, who served 580 days in jail. The investigation also provided the backdrop for the 2016 impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff, who previously chaired Petrobras’s board of directors but was impeached on separate charges that she manipulated the budget. 


Nowhere has the strength of Brazil’s judiciary been more evident than in the courts’ bold confrontation of Bolsonaro and his illiberal agenda. Just months after Bolsonaro left office, in 2023, the Superior Electoral Court, which oversees federal elections, prosecuted the former president for abuses of power linked to spreading misinformation about Brazil’s electoral system. That conviction banned him from running for public office until 2030. In September, a panel of five judges on the Federal Supreme Court ruled four to one to convict Bolsonaro on five separate charges, including seeking to stage a coup, leading an armed criminal group, and attempting a violent abolition of the democratic rule of law—the first time the country has held coup plotters accountable. 
A Helping Hand 
It’s important not to overstate the role of U.S. influence, of course: the lion’s share of the credit for this remarkable turnaround goes to the Brazilian people, who have erected strong democratic institutions in a remarkably short time. In 1988, following a participatory amendments process through the National Constituent Assembly, Brazil enacted a new constitution that guarantees a broad menu of civil, political, and human rights. It abolished the Electoral College (a holdover from the old regime used by the military to ensure that its candidates won the presidency) and afforded the Federal Supreme Court considerable powers to protect vulnerable communities and to prosecute corruption. In 2004, a constitutional amendment created the National Council of Justice to manage the judiciary, which has vastly improved the functioning and autonomy of the courts. 
But until Trump’s return to power, U.S. support for democracy in post-transition Brazil had been steadfast, and never more so than when democracy itself came under attack. After Bolsonaro supporters stormed Brasilia on January 8, 2023, an act that eerily mirrored the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, U.S. President Joe Biden telephoned Lula to affirm Washington’s “unwavering support for Brazil’s democracy.” At Biden’s request, Lula visited the White House in February 2023 to discuss strengthening democratic institutions and values. Following that meeting, the United States and Brazil initiated a series of collaborative projects intended to deepen the quality of Brazilian democracy, including a USAID-sponsored program to combat racial discrimination against Afro-Brazilians and Indigenous communities. 
Of course, Brazil’s justice system is hardly beyond reproach. According to the Brazilian NGO Rio de Paz, only about eight percent of murders in Brazil lead to a criminal conviction. Many of the corruption-related convictions and sentences that resulted from Operation Carwash have been overturned—including Lula’s. Washington has not made much of either issue. Moreover, some Brazilians have raised legitimate concerns about whether the Federal Supreme Court has grown too powerful for the good of democracy. And for a policy that purports to support the rule of law, U.S. democracy promotion has done little to advance transitional justice policies that seek accountability for the human rights abuses committed by the military. 
Nevertheless, it is difficult to ignore the cruel irony that at the precise moment when democracy promotion is bearing fruit in such a dramatic fashion in Brazil, the United States is turning its back on the policy. This will result in fewer resources dedicated to upholding the rule of law. Indeed, many Latin American NGOs are bracing for a “civil society recession,” as groups that depend on U.S. assistance close shop. Among the consequences will be a shrinking of the civic arena, which could create an opening for nondemocratic actors such as China and Russia to expand their regional influence. 
For its part, Trump’s intimidation campaign over Brazil’s conviction of Bolsonaro will also likely discourage other Latin American countries from prosecuting their own antidemocratic leaders. Because of Trump’s actions, leaders who should be held accountable for undermining democracy, human rights, and the rule of law—including Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela and Nayib Bukele of El Salvador—are resting more comfortably today. Brazil’s successful prosecution of Bolsonaro still offers Latin American countries a model to emulate. But it will be harder to do so without help from the United States.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[上周三在联合国总部召开的气候峰会上，中国最高领导人习近平远程参会并发表视频讲话。 Yuki Iwamura/Associated Press


Over a week of appearances at the United Nations, China tried to send the message that Beijing, not Washington, was the responsible power willing to shoulder global duties just as the United States, under President Trump, was signaling retreat.


通过一周来的联合国亮相，中国试图传递这样一个信息：在特朗普总统领导下的美国发出退却信号之际，北京——而非华盛顿——才是那个愿意承担全球责任的负责任大国。



China’s leaders used the U.N. General Assembly to roll out pledges on trade and fighting climate change that were notable less for their substance than for the image they projected of China as a pillar of stability and global cooperation.


中国领导人利用联合国大会推出了有关贸易和应对气候变化的承诺，这些承诺的引人注目之处不在于其内容，而在于它们所树立的中国作为稳定和全球合作支柱的形象。



In an apparent reference to the United States, Premier Li Qiang, China’s second-highest ranking official, said in his speech to the assembly on Friday that “the rise in unilateral and protectionist measures such as tariff hikes,” was slowing economic growth. By contrast, Mr. Li said, China had “consistently opened its door wider to the world.”


中国二号人物、国务院总理李强在周五的大会发言中表示，“关税大棒、‘筑墙设垒’等单边主义、保护主义措施增多”正在拖累经济增长，这明显是在影射美国。相比之下，他说，中国在“不断扩大对外开放”。



On Tuesday, he said that Beijing would no longer claim trade benefits reserved for developing nations at the World Trade Organization. Analysts said the announcement was intended to show China backing fairer trade at a time when the Trump administration was doing the opposite by weaponizing tariffs.


李强于上周二表示，中国将不再以发展中国家的身份在世界贸易组织享受贸易优惠。分析人士称，这一宣布旨在表明中国支持更公平的贸易，而此时特朗普政府目前正在做与此相反的事：把关税武器化。





On climate, China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, told a U.N. summit by video link on Wednesday that Beijing would commit to a detailed target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions for the first time. Mr. Xi said that going “green and low carbon” was the “trend of our time,” and he criticized countries that were “acting against” that transition, a not-so-veiled swipe at the United States.


在气候问题上，中国最高领导人习近平上周三通过视频在联合国峰会上表示，北京将首次承诺关于减少温室气体排放的详细目标。习近平表示，“绿色低碳”是“时代潮流”，并批评那些“逆流而动”的国家，这明显是在批评美国。



The contrast could not be greater. Mr. Xi’s pledge was made a day after Mr. Trump had derided climate change as the “greatest con job” that was “made by stupid people.”


对比再强烈不过了。习近平的承诺是在特朗普嘲讽气候变化是“由愚蠢的人编造”的“最大骗局”一天之后作出的。



上周二，特朗普在联合国大会上发表讲话。 Doug Mills/The New York Times

The back-to-back pledges crystallized Beijing’s strategy: to position itself as an antidote to “America First.” Beijing calls its approach “true multilateralism,” which involves rhetorically embracing international organizations and treaties shunned by Mr. Trump like the United Nations, the World Health Organization and the Paris climate accord.


这一项接一项的承诺明确展示了北京的战略：把自己定位为“美国优先”的解药。北京称其做法是“真正的多边主义”，包括在言辞上拥抱特朗普所摒弃的国际组织和条约，比如联合国、世界卫生组织和《巴黎气候协定》。



The goal is to persuade other countries that China is a “moral righteous actor” so that they are more likely to take their cues from Beijing and not Washington, said Dylan Loh, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.


新加坡南洋理工大学的中国外交政策专家骆明辉认为，北京的目标是说服其他国家相信中国是“正义的一方”，以使其他国家更有可能听从北京而非华盛顿的指引。



“They’re being opportunistic,” Mr. Loh said. “It’s clear that there are pockets of spaces where they see the United States leaving a vacuum in leadership, such as on climate issues, and that is where China is stepping up its game.”


“他们正在抓住机会，”骆明辉说。“很明显，他们看到在一些领域，比如在气候问题上，美国正在留下领导真空，而这正是中国加紧行动的地方。”



Whether China is doing enough to make a difference, or simply clearing the low bar of expectations set by the Trump administration’s retreat from climate science and global commitments, is an open question.


中国是做出了足以带来真正改变的行动，还是仅仅因为特朗普政府在气候科学和全球承诺方面的退缩导致人们的期待值很低，仍是一个悬而未决的问题。





Take Mr. Xi’s climate targets. Experts say China would need to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from peak levels over the next decade for there to be a realistic chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels, the main goal of the Paris climate accord. What they got instead from China, the world’s top polluting nation, was a pledge to cut between 7 and 10 percent.


以习近平的气候目标为例。专家表示，中国需要在未来十年将温室气体排放量从峰值水平减少30%，才有可能将全球变暖幅度限制在比工业化前水平高出1.5摄氏度以内——这是《巴黎气候协定》的主要目标。但他们从中国——世界上最大污染国——得到的承诺只是削减7%到10%。



“The headline target announced by President Xi has disappointed environmentalists and falls short of the climate leadership the world urgently needs,” said Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute. Mr. Li held out hope that China would eventually exceed its targets on the backs of its growing electric vehicle and wind and solar energy industries.


“习近平主席宣布的这一主要目标令环保人士失望，未能展现出世界迫切需要的气候领导力，”亚洲协会政策研究所中国气候中心主任李硕说。李硕仍然认为中国有望在不断壮大的电动汽车、风能和太阳能产业的推动下，最终超额完成目标。



China has long resisted making more ambitious climate pledges, saying such commitments would stunt its economic growth.


中国长期以来一直拒绝做出更具雄心的气候承诺，称这种承诺会阻碍其经济增长。



There is a similar tension in how China defines itself as a developing country, a description that reinforces its ties to the world’s less developed nations, even as its nearly $19 trillion economy is already the world’s second largest.


在中国将自己定义为发展中国家这一点上也存在类似的矛盾。这种定义强化了中国与欠发达国家的联系，尽管该国近19万亿美元的经济体量已使其成为世界第二大经济体。



Mr. Li’s trade pledge on Tuesday — saying China would no longer seek certain benefits at the W.T.O. — appeared aimed at narrowing that gap. Such benefits include being given more time to carry out trade agreements, for instance.


李强周二的贸易承诺——表示中国将不再在世贸组织寻求某些优惠待遇——似乎是为了缩小这一鸿沟。这类优惠待遇包括给予更多时间履行贸易协定等。



But Li Yihong, China’s top envoy to the trade body, told reporters in Geneva that China would “always be a part of the developing world.”


但中国驻世贸组织首席代表李毅红在日内瓦对记者表示，中国将“永远属于发展中国家”。





The United States has long criticized China for failing to uphold promises it made when it joined the W.T.O. in 2001, and the Trump administration argues that “developing nation” status has long allowed China to game global trading rules.


美国长期以来一直批评中国未能兑现其在2001年加入世贸组织时作出的承诺，特朗普政府认为，“发展中国家”身份长期以来让中国得以玩弄在全球贸易规则。



“China is trying to have its cake and eat it, too,” said Stephen Olson, a former U.S. trade negotiator and a senior visiting fellow at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. “It does not want to lose its ‘membership card’ in the Global South, which it aspires to lead.”


“中国想要两头都占，”美国前贸易谈判代表、新加坡尤索夫伊萨东南亚研究所高级访问研究员斯蒂芬·奥尔森说。“它不想失去自己在全球南方的‘会员卡’，又渴望领导这些国家。”



The change in policy should not deflect from some of China’s objectionable trade practices, Mr. Olson added, including its subsidizing of Chinese exports that make goods produced elsewhere in the world less competitive.


奥尔森补充说，这一政策转变不应掩盖中国一些令人反感的贸易做法，比如对中国出口的补贴，这种补贴降低了世界其他地方生产的商品的竞争力。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[特朗普总统上周五签署公告，对部分高技能外籍雇员签证收取10万美元费用。 Tierney L. Cross/The New York Times


Wall Street banks and tech companies big and small were scrambling on Saturday to figure out how their tens of thousands of employees would be affected by President Trump’s proclamation imposing a $100,000 fee for visas granted to skilled foreign workers.


上周六，特朗普总统宣布对技术型外籍雇员签证征收10万美元费用的消息令华尔街的银行以及大小科技公司陷入忙乱，针对此事将如何影响成千上万的员工进行事态评估。



The change set off immediate confusion over the exact rules and how they would be enforced. Shortly after Mr. Trump signed the proclamation on Friday, employees at Microsoft, Amazon and JPMorgan received notices advising those with H-1B visas who were outside the United States to return before the new rules take effect at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday.


这一政策变动立刻引发了关于具体细则及执行方式的困惑。上周五特朗普签署公告后不久，微软、亚马逊和摩根大通的员工立即收到通知，建议持H-1B签证且目前身处美国境外的员工在新规生效前（美东时间上周日晚12:01）返美。



The Trump administration sought to address the confusion on Saturday by saying that the fee would only apply to new applicants, and renewals or current visa holders would not be affected. In a post on social media, the White House said the change would “not impact the ability of any current visa holder to travel to/from the U.S.”


为了缓解混乱局面，特朗普政府上周六试图予以澄清，表示该收费仅适用于新的申请者，续签或现有签证持有者不受影响。白宫在社交媒体发文强调，新规“不会影响任何现有签证持有者往返美国的能力”。



Still, many executives, general counsels and human resources departments, as well as their immigration lawyers, said they were coming down on the side of caution this weekend. Several companies and attorneys had already urged workers to return to the United States as soon as possible. Many kept their eyes glued on the White House social media accounts for any pertinent clarification.


尽管如此，众多企业高管、总法律顾问、人力资源部门及其移民律师在周末仍倾向于采取谨慎态度。多家公司与律师已敦促员工尽快返美。为了获取相关澄清信息，很多人紧盯白宫社交媒体账号。





“We acknowledge that this is an uncertain time for our people on H-1B visas and your families,” Jacqueline Arthur, head of human capital management at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a memo on Saturday to employees. The memo said that Goldman was working with its lawyers “to review the specifics of the order as more detail becomes available to communicate with you accordingly.”


高盛人力资本主管杰奎琳·阿瑟上周六在给员工的备忘录中写道：“我们理解，这对持有H-1B签证的同仁及其家人而言充满不确定性。”备忘录称，高盛正与律师团队合作，“在更多细节公布后研究该命令的具体内容，并及时与你们沟通。”



Bernhard Mueller, co-chair of the immigration practice group at Ogletree Deakins, said he had been flooded with calls from executives and corporate board members about the new rules and how to communicate with employees about them. “There’s a lot of question marks all over this,” he said early Saturday. “We are still flying in somewhat foggy conditions.”


奥格特里·迪金斯律师事务所移民业务组联席主席伯恩哈德·穆勒表示，他已接到许多来自企业高管和董事会成员的电话，询问新规及如何与员工沟通。“围绕整件事仍有很多疑问，”他在上周六早些时候说。“我们仿佛仍在迷雾中飞行。”



Late Saturday, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services issued a memo underscoring that Mr. Trump’s proclamation only applied “prospectively to petitions that have not yet been filed.”


上周六深夜，美国公民及移民服务局发布备忘录强调，特朗普总统的公告仅“适用于尚未提交的申请”。



Still, the policy change represents a significant overhaul of how the United States distributes what are known as H-1B visas. The visas, which play a crucial role in helping employers fill jobs in the tech industry and beyond, have been at the center of a deep immigration debate.


尽管如此，这一政策变化仍标志着美国H-1B签证分配制度的重大改革。这种对科技行业及其他领域雇主填补职位空缺至关重要的签证，长期以来一直处于激烈的移民辩论的中心。



Immigration hard-liners contend that the visa program hurts Americans because companies have brought in foreign workers at lower wages, while many business leaders say the program helps American companies stay competitive.


移民强硬派认为H-1B签证项目损害了美国人的利益，因为公司会以较低工资引进外籍雇员；许多商界领袖则表示，该项目有助于美国企业保持竞争力。



White House officials said the policy change would help ensure that companies were giving priority to hiring domestic workers. “President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this common sense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down wages,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement.


白宫官员称，这一政策调整将有助于确保公司优先雇佣本土员工。白宫发言人泰勒·罗杰斯在一份声明中说：“特朗普总统承诺把美国劳动者放在首位，而这项合乎常理的举措通过遏止企业滥用签证制度、抑制工资下行趋势，正是在兑现这一承诺。”





But executives and industry trade groups said they worried about how the steep fee would affect businesses’ ability to fill critical positions. A spokesman for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the group was working with the Trump administration and its members to “understand the full implications and the best path forward.”


但一些企业高管和行业协会表示，他们担心高额费用会影响企业填补关键岗位的能力。美国商会的发言人表示，该组织正与特朗普政府以及商会成员合作，“以全面了解这一政策的影响，并寻找最佳的应对路径”。



“We’re concerned about the impact on employees, their families and American employers,” Matt Letourneau, a spokesman for the chamber, said in a statement.


“我们担心其对员工、他们的家庭及美国雇主造成的冲击，”商会发言人马特·勒图尔诺在声明中表示。



Amazon, Meta, Google, Apple and Walmart, which are among the biggest users of H-1B visas, either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment.


亚马逊、Meta、谷歌、苹果和沃尔玛作为H-1B签证的主要使用者，均拒绝置评或未回应评论请求。



The change was widely expected to be met with lawsuits. Jeff Joseph, the president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said the organization was working with other groups to file a legal challenge seeking a temporary restraining order as soon as this weekend. Mr. Joseph said the organizations had been making strategy calls over the weekend and working on finding plaintiffs who represent a wide range of industries.


外界普遍预计这一政策变化将面临法律诉讼。美国移民律师协会主席杰夫·约瑟夫表示，该组织正与其他团体合作，准备最早于本周末提起法律诉讼，寻求临时限制令。约瑟夫说，这些组织整个周末都在开策略会议，并努力寻找能代表各个行业的原告。



Benjamin Johnson, the executive director of the association, said the group’s members were “dealing with chaos” as their clients have been scrambling to understand the change. “I’m just hearing confusion and panic,” he said.


该协会执行董事本杰明·约翰逊指出，其成员正在“应对混乱局面”，因为他们的客户正急于弄清楚这一政策变化意味着什么。“我听到的只有困惑与恐慌，”他表示。



Although tech companies receive the most H-1B visas, Mr. Johnson underscored that the new fee would also affect workers in the medical and manufacturing industries as well as at universities who receive H-1B visas. “The numbers of companies and industries where H-1B workers play a really critical role is incredibly broad,” he said.


尽管获得H-1B签证最多的是科技公司，但约翰逊强调，新规中的高额费用也将影响到医疗、制造业以及大学领域的H-1B签证持有者。“依赖H-1B雇员的公司和行业范围实际上非常广泛，”他说。



Some workers who are currently abroad said they were unsure about how to immediately respond. A 29-year-old software engineer with a stamped H-1B visa set to begin in less than 20 days, was tucked into bed in his Munich apartment early Saturday when he realized he might be stuck in Germany.


一些目前身处海外的员工表示一时间不知应当如何应对。一名29岁的软件工程师持已贴签的H-1B签证（原定20天内生效），上周六清晨他躺在慕尼黑公寓的床上时，才意识到自己可能会被困在德国。

Speaking before the government’s clarification on how the visa fee would be applied, the software engineer, who is an Indian citizen with a German work visa, said he felt “clueless” about how to proceed. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was worried about his visa status.His company, he said, had told him to stay put.


这位持有德国工作签的印度籍工程师在政府澄清费用适用范围之前接受采访时表示，他对接下来要怎么办“毫无头绪”。由于担心签证问题，他要求匿名。他说，公司已告知他待在原地。



In its email to employees on Friday evening, Microsoft, which has roughly 5,200 employees in the program, said that workers currently in the United States should remain there “for the foreseeable future,” even if it interrupts future travel plans.


微软在上周五晚间发给员工的邮件中表示，公司大约有5200名员工持有H-1B签证。邮件建议目前在美国的员工应当“在可预见的未来”留在美国境内，即使这意味着要打乱未来的旅行计划。





“The critical thing is to stay in the U.S. in order to avoid being denied re-entry,” the advisory said.


“关键在于留在美国境内以避免被拒绝入境，”通知强调。



Some policy experts praised the Trump administration’s change and said it would help ensure that companies are not suppressing wages or giving priority to hiring foreign workers over Americans. Lora Ries, the director of the Border Security and Immigration Center at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, said the $100,000 fee was a “good start” at reforming the H-1B program because it would make companies prioritize which foreign workers they want to hire.


部分政策专家对特朗普政府的这项改革措施表示赞赏，认为这有助于确保企业不会压低工资水平，或优先聘用外籍员工而非美国人。华盛顿保守派智库传统基金会的边境安全与移民中心主任洛拉·里斯指出，10万美元收费是改革H-1B项目的“良好开端”，这将促使企业更审慎地考虑要优先雇佣哪些外国人才。



“Americans aren’t getting a fair shake at the opportunities because too many employers are bending the system,” Ms. Ries said.


“美国人没有获得公平的就业机会，因为太多雇主在钻制度的空子，”里斯说。



But the policy change also raised concerns about the long-term impact on the U.S. economy and corporate America. Venture capitalists warned that the change would add to concerns surrounding an uneven playing field, with only the nation’s largest companies being able to pay the fees or secure an exemption, as technology giants like Apple and Nvidia have already done with certain tariffs.


但这一政策变化也引发了对美国经济及企业界长期影响的担忧。风险投资家警告，新规将加剧市场对竞争环境不公平的忧虑——只有全国最大的企业才能支付得起这笔费用或争取到豁免，苹果、英伟达等科技巨头就获得了某些关税豁免。



The challenges of complying may be particularly acute for start-ups, many of which operate for years without reaching profitability.


对初创企业而言，合规挑战尤为严峻，因为它们往往要多年才能实现盈利。



“There is not a single company that I have invested in the last 10 years that could afford to pay this,” said the venture capitalist and private equity investor Alan Patricof.


“在过去10年我投资的企业中，没有一家能负担得起这笔费用，”风险投资人、私募股权投资者艾伦·帕特里科夫说。





The government caps H-1B visas at 85,000 a year, and visa holders can also bring in their immediate family in a related program. The vast majority are typically granted to Indian citizens.


政府将H-1B签证每年的发放数量限额为8.5万个，签证持有者还可通过相关项目携带直系亲属。该签证绝大多数发放给了印度籍公民。



The Indian government issued a statement on Saturday saying that it was still determining “the full implications” of the new visa rules. But, the Ministry of External Affairs said, “This measure is likely to have humanitarian consequences by way of the disruption caused for families.”


印度政府上周六发表声明称，仍在评估新签证政策的“全面影响”。但印度外交部同时指出：“这项措施可能造成家庭分离，从而引发人道主义后果。"

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[2024年4月，杭州西湖大学主教学楼内展示着一组世界级科学家的肖像——这些科学家均是从海外引进的。中国正努力吸引顶尖科学人才，力图取代美国，成为全球科技和科学进步的领跑者。 Vivian Wang/The New York Times


Just as President Trump is making it much more expensive for American companies to bring in skilled foreign workers, China is rolling out a plan to welcome them.


就在特朗普总统大幅提高美国企业引进外国技术人才的成本之际，中国正推出新计划，对这些人才敞开大门。



On Oct. 1, China will launch a new type of visa designed to make it easier for graduates of top universities in science, technology, engineering or mathematics to travel to China to study or do business.


自10月1日起，中国将正式启用一种全新的签证，旨在为来自全球顶尖高校的科学、技术、工程和数学领域毕业生提供赴华学习或开展商业活动的便利。



The new visa category is part of China’s broader campaign to attract top scientific talent as it vies with the United States for technological and geopolitical dominance. China’s visa was announced a few weeks before Mr. Trump moved to impose a $100,000 fee for H-1B visas for skilled workers.


在中美争夺科技和地缘政治主导地位的背景下，这一新签证类别是中国吸引全球顶尖科技人才的更大行动的一部分。中国的签证新政是在特朗普对H-1B工作签证征收高达10万美元新费用的几周前推出的。



As the Trump administration has attacked universities, slashed federal research funding and questioned scientific authority, China has invested vast sums into research and development. It has also lured some top scientists in the United States to positions in China.


在特朗普政府抨击高校、大幅削减联邦科研经费、质疑科学权威的同时，中国则在研发领域投入了巨额资金，并成功吸引了一些美国顶尖科学家赴华任职。





It is far from clear how much the new K visa, as China’s visa is called, will affect the race for talent. Beijing has yet to release details about the program, including who will be eligible or whether they will be allowed to take up formal employment. And while foreigners with special knowledge have long been eligible for other types of visas to enter China, albeit with more paperwork, it is difficult for foreigners to immigrate to China permanently.


目前尚不清楚中国所谓的“K字签证”能在多大程度上影响人才竞争。北京方面尚未公布该项目的具体细节，包括申请人资格，以及是否允许持证者在华正式就业。尽管具备专业知识的外国人过去也可以申请其他类型签证进入中国，但通常手续繁琐，且外国人要永久移居中国仍非常困难。



But the gesture alone may help position China as becoming more open to the world, while the United States appears to be closing itself off.


不过，单从这一政策姿态来看，也足以让外界感觉中国正朝着更加开放的方向前进，而与此同时，美国似乎正逐步走向封闭。



“Silicon Valley has become more and more into the ‘America first’ culture,” said George Chen, a partner at The Asia Group, a consulting firm based in Washington, who focuses on technology policy. For tech workers from other countries who worry they are no longer welcome in the United States, he said, “when they see the news about K visas, they might think: I will have another option at least.”


“硅谷越来越倾向于‘美国优先’的文化，”华盛顿咨询公司美商亚洲集团合伙人、专注科技政策的陈澍表示。对于那些担心自己在美国不再受到欢迎的外国科技工作者来说，他说：“当他们看到有关K字签证的消息时，可能会想：至少我还有另一个选择。”



Historically, Chinese tech companies and universities have recruited mostly domestic talent. That is in part because China has focused heavily on STEM education in recent years, which, combined with its large population, now helps it produce the most STEM graduates in the world.


长期以来，中国的科技公司和高校主要依赖本土人才。这在一定程度上是因为中国近年来高度重视STEM（科学、技术、工程和数学）教育，加上其庞大的人口基础，该国已成为全球STEM毕业生人数最多的国家。



But China still lags behind the United States in some key fields, such as semiconductors and biotechnology, and it has been eager to draw in foreign talent to help it catch up. Yet foreigners traveling to China for work or business face, as in the United States, a cumbersome visa application process, including requirements for a sponsoring company and sometimes certification by the Chinese government as a “high-level talent.”


不过，在一些关键领域，如半导体和生物技术方面，中国仍然落后于美国，因此一直渴望希望引进外国人才以缩小差距。然而，与美国类似，外国人赴华工作或经商仍面临繁琐的签证申请流程，包括需有企业担保，有时还需获得中国政府“高层次人才”的认定。



The Chinese government has tried to smooth the process in recent years. For scientists, it has offered generous incentive packages and promised to cut red tape. The new K visa will offer longer stays, multiple entries and will not require an invitation letter from a company.


近年来，中国政府一直在努力简化相关流程。对于科研人员，政府不仅提供了丰厚的激励措施，还承诺减少官僚程序。新推出的K字签证将允许持有该签证者停留更长时间、可多次入境，并且无需企业出具邀请函。





The new visa could be most helpful to start-ups that don’t have the resources to apply for traditional employment visas, or foreign students in China seeking work, said Angus Chen, a Shenzhen-based headhunter for tech companies.


深圳的科技行业招聘猎头安格斯·陈表示，这种新签证对那些缺乏资源申请传统工作签证的初创企业，或是在中国求职的外国留学生来说，将尤其有利。



“Staying in China afterward to look for jobs will become much easier,” he said.


“今后留在中国找工作的难度将大大降低，”他说。



Big tech companies, such as Alibaba or Huawei, may also be better able to bring in foreign consultants on short notice.


像阿里巴巴、华为这样的科技巨头也将更容易在短时间内引进海外顾问。



Mr. Chen at the Asia Group (no relation to Angus Chen) said the visa could allow people who were interested in the Chinese tech world to test the waters.


美商亚洲集团合伙人陈澍表示，这种签证可以让那些对中国科技领域感兴趣的人先“试水”。



“There are a lot of people who are tempted to come to China, but they’re also not so sure,” he said. “I think the interest will only grow stronger, as those Chinese tech companies become more powerful and more capital-rich.”


“有很多人心动想来中国，但又犹豫不决，”他说，“随着中国科技公司变得更加强大、资本更为充裕，这种兴趣只会越来越浓厚。”



China still faces many obstacles in drawing large pools of foreign talent. (Those scientists who have relocated to China from overseas have often been people who were born in China, then moved abroad.) There are language barriers and political and cultural differences, not to mention very limited pathways to permanent residency.


中国在吸引大量外国人才方面仍面临诸多挑战。（那些从海外迁回中国的科学家往往是出生在中国后来移居国外的人）语言障碍、政治和文化差异，以及极其有限的永久居留途径，都是阻碍因素。





“China has long been solicitous of foreign expertise, but selectively, and on its own terms,” Dan Wang, a technology analyst and research fellow at Stanford University, wrote in an email. “Generally, China only wants economically productive foreigners; the state makes it clear that foreign nationals past the age of 60 will have a hard time maintaining residence in China.”


“中国长期以来对外国专家持欢迎态度，但这种欢迎是有选择性的，并且是按照自己的规则进行的，”斯坦福大学技术分析师兼研究员王旦在一封邮件中写道。“总体而言，中国只希望吸引能创造经济效益的外国人；政府也明确表示，超过60岁的外国人在华居留将面临较大困难。”



And the K visa is unlikely to replace the H-1B. The vast majority of H-1B visa holders in the United States are Indian, but relations between China and India are fraught. On Chinese social media, when Global Times, a nationalist tabloid, posted that many Indian news outlets were reporting on the new Chinese visa, many Chinese users responded with racist comments, saying they did not welcome Indians.


K字签证不太可能取代美国H-1B签证的地位。美国大多数H-1B签证持有者是印度人，而中印两国关系复杂。在中国社交媒体上，当民族主义色彩浓厚的《环球时报》发布印度多家媒体报道中国新签证的消息时，许多中国网民发表了歧视性言论，表示不欢迎印度人。



Some Indian analysts also said that an easier visa process would do little to convince Indians to replace the United States with China.


一些印度分析人士也认为，签证手续的简化并不足以说服印度人才放弃美国，转而选择中国。



“They’re not going to the U.S. because they got a visa. They’re going because it’s a whole lifestyle. They want to work there, they want to live there, they want to become American citizens,” said Santosh Pai, a lawyer in New Delhi who advises Chinese and Indian companies.


“他们去美国不是因为拿到了签证，而是因为那是一种全面的生活方式。他们想在那里工作、生活，甚至成为美国公民，”新德里律师、为中印企业提供咨询的桑托什·派表示。



And while Chinese state media has advertised the K visa as proof of China’s openness, China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has repeatedly emphasized the need for self-reliance, to shield against geopolitical uncertainties and hostile foreign powers.


尽管中国官方媒体将K字签证宣传为中国开放的象征，但中国领导人习近平多次强调要坚持自力更生，以应对地缘政治的不确定性和外部敌对势力的挑战。



“Don’t be fooled by the K visa,” said Mr. Chen, of the Asia Group. “Yes, the K visa is to get foreign experts. But you want to get the foreign experts to help you advance your own agenda, which is ultimately about self-reliance.”


“别被K字签证迷惑了，”陈澍说。“没错，K字签证是为了引进外国专家，但你引进外国专家的目的是为了推动自己的议程，而这最终归根结底是为了实现自力更生。”

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[上周五，中国国务院总理李强在联合国大会上发表讲话。 Dave Sanders for The New York Times


China’s premier, Li Qiang, the country’s second-highest-ranking official, made a spirited effort at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Friday to shore up Beijing’s image on the global stage and contrast it with the disruptive policies of the Trump administration.


中国二号人物、国务院总理李强周五在纽约的联合国大会上大力维护北京在国际舞台上的形象，并将其与特朗普政府的破坏性政策进行对比。



Mr. Li portrayed his country as a bulwark against the erosion of the values upon which the United Nations was founded and a force for global cooperation and multilateralism. “China has all along acted as a staunch defender of world peace and security,” he said.


李强将中国描绘成一座堡垒，捍卫了作为联合国创立根基的价值观，同时还是一股推动全球合作和多边主义的力量。他说：“中国始终是世界和平安全的坚定维护者。”



“A major cause of the current global economic doldrums is the rise in unilateral and protectionist measures such as tariff hikes,” Mr. Li said, an apparent reference to the trade policies of the United States under Mr. Trump. By contrast, China had “consistently opened its door wider to the world,” he said.


“现在世界经济低迷困厄，很重要的原因是关税大棒、‘筑墙设垒’等单边主义、保护主义措施增多，”李强说，这显然是指特朗普任内美国的贸易政策。相比之下，他说，中国“不断扩大对外开放”。



Mr. Li’s comments and other efforts at the United Nations this week — including China’s first detailed public pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions — have continued Beijing’s effort to cast China as a leader of global institutions at a time of American retreat under Mr. Trump.


李强的言论以及中国上周在联合国的其他行动——包括首次公开就减少温室气体排放做出具体的承诺——延续了北京试图在特朗普领导下的美国退却之际，将中国塑造为全球机构领导者的努力。





China has tried to seize on the unpopularity of America’s trade policy and U.S. support for Israel to drive a wedge between Washington and the rest of the world.


中国试图利用美国贸易政策的不受欢迎，以及美国支持以色列的立场，在华盛顿与世界之间制造隔阂。



Beijing assigns great importance to the United Nations because the country wields major influence by holding one of five permanent seats on the Security Council. Beijing has often used that influence to marshal support from developing nations to cast votes in the U.N. General Assembly that align with its interests.


北京高度重视联合国，是因为中国是安理会五个常任理事国之一，拥有重大影响力。北京经常利用这种影响力争取发展中国家的支持，使其在联合国大会上的投票符合中国利益。



This week, Mr. Li met with the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, and called on developing countries to “jointly oppose bullying and hegemony.” Mr. Li also met on the sidelines of the meeting with Bill Gates, the tech billionaire and philanthropist, and asked him to help deepen cooperation between China and the United States.


上周，李强会见了联合国秘书长安东尼奥·古特雷斯，并呼吁发展中国家“共同反对霸凌和霸权”。李强还在会议期间会见了科技业亿万富翁、慈善家比尔·盖茨，请他帮助深化中美合作。



Relations between Beijing and Washington have stabilized since the powers became locked in a bitter trade war this year. President Trump and China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, held a phone call last week, and Mr. Trump said they had agreed to meet next month on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Gyeongju, South Korea.


自今年中美两国陷入激烈贸易战以来，两国关系已趋于稳定。特朗普总统和中国最高领导人习近平上周通了电话，特朗普表示，两人同意下个月在韩国庆州举行的亚太经合组织峰会期间会面。



On Tuesday, Mr. Li said China would no longer claim trade benefits as a developing nation at the World Trade Organization. The decision, analysts said, was aimed at casting China as a champion of fair trade at a time when the Trump administration was undermining the global trading system with tariffs.


李强上周二表示，中国将不再以发展中国家的身份在世界贸易组织享受贸易优惠。分析人士称，这一决定的目的是在特朗普政府通过加征关税来破坏全球贸易体系的背景下，将中国塑造为公平贸易的捍卫者。



A day later, at a U.N. climate summit, Mr. Xi announced over video link a detailed target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions from China’s huge economy. By contrast, Mr. Trump used his address to the General Assembly on Monday to rail against climate science as a “con job” that was “made by stupid people.”


一天后，习近平在联合国气候峰会上通过视频宣布了减少中国庞大经济体的温室气体排放的详细目标。与之形成对比的是，特朗普周一在联大讲话中抨击气候科学是“由愚蠢的人编造的”一个“骗局”。





On global politics, Mr. Li cast China as a force for peace and cooperation, citing Beijing’s support for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, as well as Israel and Palestinians. China has long supported an independent Palestinian state based on the borders set before the Arab-Israeli war of 1967, when Israel defeated a coalition of Arab states.


在全球政治方面，李强将中国塑造为和平与合作的力量，并提到北京对乌克兰和俄罗斯之间，以及以色列和巴勒斯坦之间和平谈判的支持。中国长期支持以1967年阿以战争前的边境线为基础，建立一个独立的巴勒斯坦国，在那场战争中，以色列击败了阿拉伯国家联盟。



China has been a close ally of Russia since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Earlier this month, Mr. Xi signaled that Beijing would continue to align itself with Moscow on issues of shared interest after a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.


自从俄罗斯在2022年对乌克兰发起全面入侵以来，中国一直是俄罗斯的亲密盟友。本月早些时候，习近平在与俄罗斯总统普京会晤后表明，北京将继续与莫斯科在共同关心的问题上保持一致。

 Sandu: 'We will do our best' not to miss EU opportunity
    
DW asked Moldovan President Maia Sandu if she believes that Brussels will honor its commitment to welcoming her country into the EU if Moldova implements the necessary reforms to become eligible for membership.
In the past, other countries' EU membership bids have stalled or become caught up in institutional deadlock driven by internal disagreements among EU states.
"I do believe in meritocracy. I do understand that the geopolitics can change and sometimes this can become an impediment. But we are determined to work very hard," Sandu said at her press conference in Chisinau.
"We do have positive reports from Brussels on the steps that we have made so far, and we will do our best not to miss this opportunity," she added.
With 100% of the ballots counted, Maia Sandu's pro-EU Party of Action and Solidarity won 50.2% of the votes in Sunday's election. The pro-Russia Patriotic Bloc came in second with 24.2%.

 Pro-Russian opposition claims election results are false

Not everyone in Moldova is happy with the results of Sunday's high-stakes election. On Monday afternoon, a few hundred supporters of the pro-Russian opposition bloc showed up to a planned demonstration outside Moldova's parliament in Chisinau.
"They falsified the results," one woman claimed. Others accused Moldovan authorities of trying to prevent people from voting, a claim echoed in Moscow. 
Members of the European Network of Election Monitoring Organisations said in a press conference on Monday that voting in Moldova was "competitive and offered citizens a clear choice" and commended officials' and citizens' "resilience."
However, observers raised some concerns about another issue that kept coming up at the opposition rally: a last-minute decision by Moldovan authorities to ban two small pro-Russian parties from running in Sunday's election over suspected illegal financing. 
Election observer Paula Cardoso said the timing limited the candidates' rights to "seek effective remedy" but noted that electoral authorities "otherwise managed technical preparations of these elections professionally and efficiently."
Outside the parliament, opposition leaders led the crowd in chants of "Moldova, Moldova, Moldova" and "Freedom." Then, en masse, the supporters all left and head off in the same direction.
Earlier on Monday, Moldovan police said they "had information" that some people had been promised cash to participate in the protest.

 Election result 'strong mandate' for EU accession — Sandu
    
Moldovan President Maia Sandu has said the election win by her pro-EU Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) showed both her country's unity under pressure and its people's strong support for the government's European aspirations.
The PAS' victory "showed that we know how to be united when the future of our country is in danger," she said.
"Yesterday's vote is a strong mandate for the process of Moldova's accession to the EU," she told reporters.
Her remarks come against the background of accusations leveled at Moscow over its alleged attempts at interference in the elections, which saw the PAS pitted against a Russia-friendly rival party.
With over 99.96% of ballots counted, Sandu's PAS had received 50.17% of the vote, as against 24.18% for the pro-Russia Patriotic bloc, according to figures from the election commission.
The result, slightly lower for the PAS than at previous elections in 2021, means that PAS is likely to hold 55 seats in the 101-member parliament, down from the current 63 seats.

 Election was 'final battle for the future' — PAS leader Grosu

The leader of Moldova's pro-EU Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) has said Sunday's election was a fight against "enemies of our country that once seemed impossible to defeat" and a "final battle for the future."
Igor Grosu, whose party handed a heavy defeat to its Russia-friendly rival, said that Moscow had used "vile" tactics in an attempt to turn the vote in its favor.
"The Russian Federation threw into battle everything it had that was most vile — mountains of money, mountains of lies, mountains of illegalities. It used criminals to try to turn our entire country into a haven for crime. It filled everything with hatred," he said.
"We know and understand that many did not vote for the party, but for the European future of the country and to protect the country from a pro-Russian majority," he added.

 Kremlin says Moldovans in Russia prevented from voting
    
The Kremlin has accused Moldovan authorities of preventing hundreds of thousands from casting a ballot in Sunday's parliamentary elections.
Moscow said Moldovans living in Russia had only two polling stations at their disposal to submit their vote.
However, when asked whether Moscow recognized the results, which saw a Russia-friendly party suffer a heavy defeat at the hands of its pro-EU opponent, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said only that "some political forces" in Moldova had alleged election violations.
"First, Moldovans themselves should probably sort this out. As far as we know, some political forces are declaring their disagreement. They're talking about possible election violations," he said.

 'Russia failed to destablize Moldova' — Ukraine's Zelenskyy
    
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has congratulated Moldova's ruling pro-EU party on its victory in parliamentary elections, saying the win came despite Moscow's efforts to subvert the result.
"Russia failed to destabilize Moldova even after spending huge, huge resources to undermine it and to corrupt whoever they could," Zelenskyy said in an address via video link to a conference in the Polish capital, Warsaw.
Moldova, a former Soviet republic, borders on Ukraine to the north, east and south.

 German, French, Polish leaders congratulate Moldova
    
The leaders of Germany, France and Poland have issued a joint statement praising Moldova for its election result, which saw the ruling pro-EU party of President Maia Sandu deliver a resounding defeat to its Russia-friendly opponent.
"We commend the Moldovan society and authorities for the peaceful conduct of the election, despite unprecedented interference by Russia, including with vote-buying schemes and disinformation," said German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.
The result from Sunday's election is being seen as an endorsement of Moldova's aspirations to join the European Union while moving further from Russia's sphere of influence.

 'There should be relief in all of Europe,' Moldovan lawmaker tells DW
    
Moldovan parliamentarian Radu Marian, a member of the ruling pro-EU Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) that won Sunday's election, has said the whole of Europe should celebrate the result.
 "There should be relief in all of Europe because peace, progress, democracy has won," Marian said in Chisinau in an interview with DW's Rosie Birchard.
"I think we did a great job in fighting the mighty Russian dictatorship. We fought with them and not necessarily the opposition," Marian added, referring to accusations by Moldovan authorities of election interference by Moscow.  
Moldovan government spokesman Daniel Voda told DW that the result was "a celebration of democracy" and pointed toward Europe  
"Moldovan people in the country and abroad have spoken," he  said.
"This vote for pro-European parties and for the majority in the parliament for pro-European parties is showing that the direction is clear: Moldovan people want peace, development under the European Union family."
The EU announced the start of accession talks with Moldova in December 2023, and negotiations officially began in June 2024.
Moldova has set a target date of 2028 for accession to the bloc.

 'We will stand with you every step of the way' — von der Leyen
    
The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has praised Moldova for the results in Sunday's parliamentary election, in which the pro-EU ruling PAS party won more than half of the votes.
In a post on X, von der Leyen said the country had chosen Europe, democracy and freedom.
"No attempt to sow fear or division could break your resolve. You made your choice clear: Europe. Democracy. Freedom," she said.
"Our door is open. And we will stand with you every step of the way. The future is yours," von der Leyen added.

European Parliament President Roberta Metsola also hailed the election result.
"The future of Moldova is in Europe!" Metsola wrote.
"On this historic step forward, the people of Moldova have chosen the path of democracy, hope and opportunities. They have chosen Europe," she said.

 France's Macron hails election result
    
French President Emmanuel Macron has welcomed the PAS' victory and said his country supports Moldova's path toward EU membership.
"The Moldovan people have clearly made their choice, in spite of the attempts of outside interference," Macron wrote on X.
"France stands beside Moldova in its European aspirations and its desire for freedom and sovereignty," he added.

Moldovan authorities are braced for protests on Monday after former President Igor Dodon, one of the leaders of the pro-Russian Patriotic Bloc that lost the parliamentary election, accused the pro-EU Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) of stealing the vote.
"If during the night there are falsifications, tomorrow we won't recognize (the result of) the parliamentary elections [...] and we will ask for elections to be repeated," he said late on Sunday outside the electoral commission.
President Maia Sandu and the EU have accused Moscow of trying to sway the vote through widespread disinformation and vote-buying.

Moldova's ruling party, the pro-EU Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), has won Sunday's parliamentary elections.
PAS took more than 50% of the vote, official results showed on Monday.
With over 99.5% of ballots counted, the PAS, led by President Maia Sandu, received 50.03% of the vote, compared to 24.26% for the pro-Russian Patriotic Bloc, according to results published on the election commission's website.

With Moldova's ruling pro-EU Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) on track to top polls in the closely-watched parliamentary election, PAS lawmaker Radu Marian said it was a victory for all of Europe.
"There should be relief in all Europe because peace, progress, democracy is won," Marian told DW.
"And I think we did a great job in fighting the mighty Russian dictatorship. We fought with them and not necessarily the opposition."
Daniel Voda, Moldovan government spokesperson, echoed a similar sentiment.
"Basically, what we see now is a celebration of democracy. Moldovan people in the country and abroad have spoken," he said.
"Moldovan people want peace, development under the European Union family," he added.

 Ruling PAS wins pivotal parliamentary election
    
With 98% of votes counted, the results showed that around half of Moldovans favored staying on the EU course. 
The ruling pro-EU Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), which has held a strong parliamentary majority since 2021, secured 49.6% of ballots, according to preliminary results.
The pro-Russian Patriotic Bloc came second, winning 24.6%.
More than 1.59 million, or about 51.9% of eligible voters, had voted in the election, the Central Electoral Commission reported.
Some 276,000 Moldovans have cast their ballots in polling stations abroad, which will remain open until 7 p.m. in their respective countries.

 Optimism at PAS headquarters as pro-EU party takes lead
   
Rosie Birchard
   
We're back in Chisinau at the election night headquarters of the Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), which came to power in Moldova in 2021 on a staunchly pro-EU and pro-Western ticket.
Every now and then, we hear cheers from a room full of party members upstairs. For now, they have good reason to be optimistic: Early results show the party is out in front in the polls, with the pro-Russian opposition in second. 
Pre-election polls showed PAS was projected to lose its majority and the final outcome of the vote is still far from clear.
PAS may find itself in need of coalition partners — something which could complicate the reform process needed for Moldova to become eligible to join the EU.
The pro-Russian opposition has already called for protests on Monday.
There is a heavy police presence on the streets of Chisinau, with law enforcement announcing they detained several people late on Sunday over suspected plans to stir up unrest. 

How are people feeling about Moldova's pivotal vote?

 Polling stations close in Moldova
    
Polling stations have closed for Moldova's high-stakes parliamentary elections, which are crucial for the country's political future.
Although exit polls were not conducted, preliminary results are expected later today.
The Central Electoral Commission reported that more than 1.59 million people had cast their ballots by 9 p.m. local time (18:00 GMT), accounting for approximately 51.9% of eligible voters.
This figure includes the 264,000 Moldovans who voted at polling stations set up abroad. These stations will remain open until 7 p.m. local time.

 How do Transnistrians vote?
   
Rosie Birchard
   
We meet people queuing up in the village of Gura Bicului at one of the polling stations where voters from the pro-Russian breakaway region of Transnistria can cast their ballots.
They cross the nearby border and line up to vote, showing the Moldovan ID documents that entitle them to vote despite living in a region controlled by pro-Russian separatist authorities where Russian troops have been stationed for decades. Transnistria is not internationally recognized.

"Yes, I want to be closer to Russia," one woman tells us. "I think every Transnistrian does. Right?" she asks others in the line. “Right,” she says, answering her own question. In fact, it's more nuanced than that. Several others say they are not sure what they'll decide.
When voting is delayed in the afternoon by what officials tell us are server issues, one man from Transnistria tells us he's sure the Moldovan authorities are trying to stop him from casting his ballot. Voting resumes shortly afterward and he heads inside.

 Moldova’s undecided voters 
   
Rosie Birchard
   
Many of the people we’ve spoken to here in Moldova told us they had not yet made up their mind who to vote for as they headed into the ballot box. 
That’s the case for 42-year-old Vitaly, whom we meet while he and his family harvest beetroot under the sun in a field in the south of Moldova.

Politics feels far away here, and Vitaly says he feels neutral about whether Moldova should be closer to Russia or the West.
Undecided voters like Vitaly, as well as the lack of polling for Moldova’s diaspora and for those living in the pro-Russian breakaway region of Transnistria, make the results of these crucial elections very hard to predict.

 WATCH — Why is Moldova's upcoming parliamentary election so pivotal?
   
Lavinia Pitu
  
Dmytro Hubenko
   
The parliamentary election in the Republic of Moldova on September 28 is not only crucial for the country itself, but it will also be watched closely in capitals across Europe and in Moscow. 
Sandwiched between Ukraine and Romania, which is a member of both the EU and NATO, Moldova has gained major geopolitical significance since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. 
The current government in Chisinau is unequivocally pro-European. 
Pro-Russian opposition candidates blame the government and the EU for the country's problems.
But what about the people?
Amid economic hardship, corruption, massive emigration in recent decades, and a war in neighboring Ukraine, Moldovans seem to believe that everything will be determined by one question: Europe or Russia? 

Why is Moldova's upcoming parliamentary election so pivotal?

Igor Dodon, former president of Moldova and a member of the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc, said Sunday's vote is a day when "the people are not afraid, but others are afraid of the people."
After casting his ballot, Dodon also dismissed the claims made by his rivals of "massive interference" by Moscow, insisting that "the interference came from the West."
"We saw this interference through various foundations, through (US billionaire George) Soros and non-governmental organizations that intimidated people. We believe this to be wrong, we are in favor of good relations with the East and the West," Dodon told reporters.

While the outcome of the vote will not be known until Sunday evening at the earliest, Dodon said it was "already clear that the opposition will win."
"But President Maia Sandu has indicated that the outcome of the election could be annulled, like it happened in Romania. This is why I am calling on everyone to join the protest at 12:00 at the parliament building, to protect our victory," he was quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency.

 How Russia maintains its grip on breakaway Transnistria 
    
Moldova, once a part of the Soviet Union, became independent after its collapse. However, Moscow still has troops in the ethnically mixed region of Transnistria, where pro-Russian separatist maintain a Soviet-style dictatorship over some 13% of Moldovan population.

Moldovan President Maia Sandu cast her vote at a polling station in the capital, Chisinau, on Sunday morning, warning that the eastern European country could "lose everything it has won" in its fight to break out of Russia's orbit.
She also accused the Kremlin of "massive interference" and said Moldova was "in danger."

"Russia wants to take control of our country so that it can use it against Ukraine and the European Union. From here, it could train people for illegal actions or even launch drones, as it does from Belarus," Sandu told reporters outside the polling station.

 Why is Moldova is so important to Russia and Europe?
   
Keno Verseck
   
Since declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Moldova — a country of 3 million people —— has sought its own path in Europe. But Russia would prefer keeping Moldova within its own sphere of influence.
Why has this small eastern European country become so significant?

Ahead of the parliamentary election on September 28, DW asked some locals in the largely pro-Russian Autonomous Territorial Unit of Gagauzia how they see their future.
In the early 1990s, the region of Gagauzia made a push for independence, which ended when the Moldovan government granted it extensive autonomy in 1994.
Unlike the rest of Moldova, where Romanian is the main language, many people here speak Russian and consume Russian-language media — giving them strong cultural ties to Moscow.

 Two pro-Russian parties banned ahead of Moldova's election
    
Moldova's Central Electoral Commission excluded the pro-Russia party Greater Moldova (Moldova Mare) from participating in Sunday's parliamentary vote.
The commission said that the Greater Moldova party was excluded following findings that the party was using illegal financing and foreign funding.
Greater Moldova leader Victoria Furtuna said she would appeal the biased decision, the Moldpress media outlet reported.
The decision was made late on Friday. It is the second pro-Russian party to be disqualified amid concerns over alleged Russian interference.
Earlier on Friday, Moldova's election authority banned the Heart of Moldova party, which was part of the Russia-friendly Patriotic Electoral Bloc (BEP) — one of the main opponents of the ruling Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS).

Ahead of Sunday's vote, Moldova's pro-EU President Maia Sandu warned of heavy Russian interference.
In an interview released on Saturday, Sandu told German public broadcaster ZDF that the country's territorial "integrity and independence" are at stake.
According to Sandu, Moscow is exerting enormous pressure to influence the vote, spending "hundreds of millions of euros" to finance political parties, bribe voters and train young people for destabilizing activities.
Polls indicate that Sandu's pro-EU Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) is likely to remain the strongest force, though the party may lose the majority it has held since 2021. Pro-Russian parties are also projected to perform well.
Sandu noted that Chisinau is on a promising path towards EU membership. "We have made great progress in the past three years. I truly believe that the Republic of Moldova can be an EU member by the end of the decade," she told ZDF.
She said she would "continue fighting for democracy" even if the pro-EU camp loses Sunday's election.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[北京天安门广场的监控摄像头，摄于去年。 Ng Han Guan/Associated Press


American officials were alarmed in 2023 when they discovered that Chinese state-controlled hackers had infiltrated critical U.S. infrastructure with malicious code that could wreck power grids, communications systems and water supplies. The threat was serious enough that William J. Burns, the director of the C.I.A., made a secret trip to Beijing to confront his Chinese counterpart.


2023年，美国官员震惊地发现中国政府控制的黑客在美国关键基础设施中植入恶意代码，可能破坏电网、通信系统和供水系统。威胁的严重性促使中央情报局局长威廉·伯恩斯秘密前往北京，与中方对口官员正面交涉。



He warned China’s minister of state security that there would be “serious consequences” for Beijing if it unleashed the malware. The tone of the meeting, details of which have not been previously reported, was professional and it appeared the message was delivered.


他警告中国的国家安全部长，若北京启用该恶意软件，将面临“严重后果”。这次会晤的细节此前从未披露。会谈气氛是专业的，信息似乎已被有效传达。”



But since that meeting, which was described by two former U.S. officials, China’s intrusions have only escalated. (The former officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the sensitive meeting.)


但据两位前美国官员描述，自那次会晤后，中国的侵入行为反而加剧了。（由于未获授权公开讨论这一敏感会晤，这两位前官员要求匿名。）



American and European officials say China’s Ministry of State Security, the civilian spy agency often called the M.S.S., in particular, has emerged as the driving force behind China’s most sophisticated cyber operations.


美国和欧洲官员表示，中国的国家安全部——一个民事情报机构，常简称为MSS——尤其成为中国这场最复杂的网络行动的主要推手。





In recent disclosures, officials revealed another immense, yearslong intrusion by hackers who have been collectively called Salt Typhoon, one that may have stolen information about nearly every American and targeted dozens of other countries. Some countries hit by Salt Typhoon warned in an unusual statement that the data stolen could provide Chinese intelligence services with the capability to “identify and track their targets’ communications and movements around the world.”


近期披露显示，官员们揭露了被称为“盐台风”的黑客团体实施的另一场持续多年的大规模入侵，可能已窃取了几乎每个美国人的信息，并锁定了数十个其他国家。一些受“盐台风”攻击的国家在罕见声明中警告，窃取的数据可能使中国情报机构具备“识别和跟踪目标对象全球通信及行动”的能力。



The attack underscored how the Ministry of State Security has evolved into a formidable cyberespionage agency capable of audacious operations that can evade detection for years, experts said.


专家指出，这次攻击凸显出国家安全部已发展成为一个强大的网络间谍机构，能够实施大胆行动且多年不被察觉。



For decades, China has used for-hire hackers to break into computer networks and systems. These operatives sometimes mixed espionage with commercial data theft or were sloppy, exposing their presence. In the recent operation by Salt Typhoon, however, intruders linked to the M.S.S. found weaknesses in systems, burrowed into networks, spirited out data, hopped between compromised systems and erased traces of their presence.


几十年来，中国一直使用雇佣的黑客入侵计算机网络和系统。这些黑客有时会将间谍活动和商业数据盗窃混杂在一起，有时因操作不慎暴露行踪。然而，在近期“盐台风”的行动中，与国家安全部有关联的入侵者通过挖掘系统弱点潜入网络，窃取数据，在被攻破的系统间跳转，并清除活动痕迹。

“Salt Typhoon shows a highly skilled and strategic side to M.S.S. cyber operations that has been missed with the attention on lower-quality contract hackers,” said Alex Joske, the author of a book on the ministry.


著有一本有关该部著作的亚历克斯·约斯克表示：“‘盐台风’显示了国家安全部网络行动的高技能和战略性，此前人们更关注低质量的雇工黑客而忽略了这一点。”



For Washington, the implication of China’s growing capability is clear: In a future conflict, China could put U.S. communications, power and infrastructure at risk.


对华盛顿而言，中国日益增强的能力意味着：在未来冲突中，中国可能威胁美国的通信、电力和基础设施。



China’s biggest hacking campaigns have been “strategic operations” intended to intimidate and deter rivals, said Nigel Inkster, a senior adviser for cybersecurity and China at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.


伦敦国际战略研究所网络安全与中国问题高级顾问奈杰尔·因克斯特表示，中国的最大黑客行动是旨在威慑和遏制对手的“战略行动”。





“If they succeed in remaining on these networks undiscovered, that potentially gives them a significant advantage in the event of a crisis,” said Mr. Inkster, formerly director of operations and intelligence in the British Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. “If their presence is — as it has been — discovered, it still exercises a very significant deterrent effect; as in, ‘Look what we could do to you if we wanted.’”


“若能持续潜伏于这些网络而不被发现，他们在危机爆发时将获得显著优势，”曾任英国秘密情报机构MI6行动与情报主任的因克斯特说，“即使他们的存在被发现——正如现在的情况——仍具有强大的威慑效果，相当于在说，‘你看，我们想做什么就能做什么。’”



The Rise of the M.S.S.


国家安全部的崛起



China’s cyber advances reflect decades of investment to try to match, and eventually rival, the U.S. National Security Agency and Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ.


中国在网络领域的进步反映了数十年来的持续努力，目标是追赶并最终抗衡美国国家安全局和英国政府通信总部（简称GCHQ）。



China’s leaders founded the Ministry of State Security in 1983 mainly to track dissidents and perceived foes of Communist Party rule. The ministry engaged in online espionage but was long overshadowed by the Chinese military, which ran extensive cyberspying operations.


中国领导人于1983年组建国家安全部，主要用于跟踪异见人士和共产主义统治的潜在敌人。该部门从事网络间谍活动，但相比开展大规模网络间谍行动的中国军方，国安部很长时间里在该领域并不突出。



After taking power as China’s top leader in 2012, Xi Jinping moved quickly to reshape the M.S.S. He seemed unsettled by the threat of U.S. surveillance to China’s security, and in a 2013 speech pointed to the revelations of Edward J. Snowden, the former U.S. intelligence contractor.


2012年习近平成为中国最高领导人后，迅速重塑国家安全部。他似乎因美国监控对中国国家安全构成的威胁感到不安，并在2013年的一次讲话中提到前美国情报承包商爱德华·斯诺登的揭露。



Mr. Xi purged the ministry of senior officials accused of corruption and disloyalty. He reined in the hacking role of the Chinese military, elevating the ministry as the country’s primary cyberespionage agency. He put national security at the core of his agenda with new laws and by establishing a new commission.


习近平清洗了国安部被控腐败和不忠的高级官员，收紧了中国军方的黑客角色，将国家安全部提升为主要的网络间谍机构。他通过立法并设立一个新委员会将国家安全置于议程核心。



在2013年于北京举行的全国人民代表大会上，习近平当选国家主席。掌权后，习近平迅速采取行动，重塑国家安全部。 Ng Han Guan/Associated Press

“At this same time, the intelligence requirements imposed on the security apparatus start to multiply, because Xi wanted to do more things abroad and at home,” said Matthew Brazil, a senior analyst at BluePath Labs who has co-written a history of China’s espionage services.


“与此同时，对安全机构的情报需求成倍增加，因为习近平希望在国内外做更多事情，”BluePath Labs高级分析师、与他人合著了一本讲述中国情报机构历史书的马修·巴西表示。



Since around 2015, the M.S.S. has moved to bring its far-flung provincial offices under tighter central control, said experts. Chen Yixin, the current minister, has demanded that local state security offices follow Beijing’s orders without delay. Security officials, he said on a recent inspection of the northeast, must be both “red and expert” — absolutely loyal to the party while also adept in technology.


专家们称，从2015年前后开始，国家安全部将各省分支机构置于更严格的中央控制之下。现任部长陈一新要求地方国安部门毫不迟疑地执行北京的命令。他在近期视察东北地区时表示，国安干部必须“又红又专”——对党绝对忠诚，同时精通技术。





“It all essentially means that the Ministry of State Security now sits atop a system in which it can move its pieces all around the chessboard,” said Edward Schwarck, a researcher at the University of Oxford who is writing a dissertation on China’s state security.


牛津大学研究中国国家安全的研究员爱德华·施瓦茨表示：“这本质上意味着国家安全部现在掌控着一个系统，可以在棋盘上随意移动棋子。”他正在撰写关于中国国家安全的论文。



Mr. Chen was the official who met with Mr. Burns in May 2023. He gave nothing away when confronted with the details of the cyber campaign, telling Mr. Burns he would let his superiors know about the U.S. concerns, the former officials said.


2023年5月伯恩斯访华面见的官员就是陈一新。前官员透露，面对美方摆出的网络行动细节，他不露声色，仅表示会向其上级转告美国的关切。



The Architect of China’s Cyber Power


中国网络力量的设计者



The Ministry of State Security operates largely in the shadows, its officials rarely seen or named in public. There was one exception: Wu Shizhong, who was a senior official in Bureau 13, the “technical reconnaissance” arm of the ministry.


国家安全部大多在暗中运作，其官员鲜少公开露面或被指名道姓地提及。吴世忠是一个例外，他曾是第十三局——安全部“技术侦查”部门——的高级官员。



Mr. Wu was unusually visible, turning up at meetings and conferences in his other role as director of the China Information Technology Security Evaluation Center. Officially, the center vets digital software and hardware for security vulnerabilities before it can be used in China. Unofficially, foreign officials and experts say, the center comes under the control of the M.S.S. and provided a direct pipeline of information about vulnerabilities and hacking talent.


吴世忠是一个反常的高调人物，以他的另一个身份——中国信息安全评测中心主任——参加会议和研讨会。该中心表面上为中国使用的数字软硬件审查安全漏洞，但外国官员和专家表示，该中心受国家安全部控制，为其提供漏洞和黑客人才的直接信息渠道。



Mr. Wu has not publicly said he served in the security ministry, but a Chinese university website in 2005 described him as a state security bureau head in a notice about a meeting, and investigations by Crowd Strike and other cybersecurity firms have also described his state security role.


吴世忠从未公开承认在国家安全部任职，但2005年中国一所大学网站在会议通知中称他在国家安全部任局长，Crowd Strike等网络安全公司的调查也描述了他的角色。





“Wu Shizhong is widely recognized as a leading figure in the creation of M.S.S. cyber capabilities,” said Mr. Joske.


约斯克表示：“吴世忠被广泛认为是国家安全部网络能力创建的领军人物。”



In 2013, Mr. Wu pointed to two lessons for China: Mr. Snowden’s disclosures about American surveillance and the use by the United States of a virus to sabotage Iran’s nuclear facilities. “The core of cyber offense and defense capabilities is technical prowess,” he said, stressing the need to control technologies and exploit their weaknesses. China, he added, should create “a national cyber offense and defense apparatus.”


2013年，吴世忠指出中国应吸取两点经验：斯诺登揭露的美国监控和美国用病毒破坏伊朗核设施的行动。“网络攻防能力的核心是技术实力，”他说，强调需控制技术并利用其弱点，建议中国打造“国家网络攻防体系”。



China’s commercial tech sector boomed in the years that followed, and state security officials learned how to put domestic companies and contractors to work, spotting and exploiting flaws and weak spots in computer systems, several cybersecurity experts said. The U.S. National Security Agency has also hoarded knowledge of software flaws for its own use. But China has an added advantage: It can tap its own tech companies to feed information to the state.


随后几年，中国商业科技行业蓬勃发展，多位网络安全专家表示，国家安全官员已经学会利用国内公司和承包商为其工作，发现并利用计算机系统的漏洞和弱点。美国国家安全局也囤积软件漏洞知识供己用，但中国有额外优势：可利用本国科技公司为国家提供信息。

“M.S.S. was successful at improving the talent pipeline and the volume of good offensive hackers they could contract to,” said Dakota Cary, a researcher who focuses on China’s efforts to develop its hacking capabilities at SentinelOne. “This gives them a significant pipeline for offensive tools.”


“国家安全部成功改善了人才输送渠道，积累了大量可供其调遣的进攻性黑客，”SentinelOne研究员达科塔·卡里表示。“这成了他们获取进攻手段的重要渠道。”



The Chinese government also imposed rules requiring that any newly found software vulnerabilities be reported first to a database that analysts say is operated by the M.S.S., giving security officials early access. Other policies reward tech firms with payments if they meet monthly quotas of finding flaws in computer systems and submitting them to the state security-controlled database.


中国政府还规定，新发现的软件漏洞需首先报告给一个数据库——分析人士称该数据库由国家安全部运营——让安全官员优先获取。还有一些政策奖励科技公司发现漏洞并提交到安全部控制的数据库，每月达到一定额度可获报酬。



“It’s a prestige thing and it’s good for a company’s reputation,” Mei Danowski, the co-founder of Natto Thoughts, a company that advises clients on cyber threats, said of the arrangement. “These business people don’t feel like they are doing something wrong. They feel like they are doing something for their country.”


“这是一件光荣的事，有利于公司的声誉，”Natto Thoughts联合创始人梅·达诺夫斯基谈到这一安排时表示，该公司为客户提供网络威胁咨询服务。“这些商人不觉得自己做错了什么。他们觉得自己是在为国家出力。”

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[An aggressive flu virus has gripped northern India. Two-thirds of families in the region are affected. Who's most at risk? And how can people protect themselves?
    Symptoms of H3N2 are usually more severe and last longer than with regular flu or colds Image: Maria Kraynova/Zoonar/picture alliance   
Northern India, in particular the Delhi metropolitan region, is experiencing a significant spike in infections with the H3N2 strain of influenza this autumn. There are about 46 million people in the conurbation around the Indian capital, which extends across many neighboring towns and districts in the states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.
According to a survey by the community-based social media platform LocalCircles, 69% of households in the area currently have at least one person with flu-like symptoms. Doctors say H3N2 is currently the predominant influenza variant in the region.
"The increasing numbers make it clear that the virus is circulating extensively," Dr. Rituja Ugalmugle, a consultant at Wockhardt Hospitals in Mumbai Central, told the newspaper Indian Express. Reports of growing numbers of cases are also coming in from other states.

Who's at risk
H3N2 infections often start with a sudden high fever, shivering, a sore throat and a runny nose. Other symptoms may include a dry or productive cough, bad headaches, aching arms and legs, muscle pains, and severe fatigue and weakness. Some patients, particularly children, may lose their appetite, feel nauseous, or have gastro-intestinal problems.
Children, the elderly, pregnant people, and people with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes and heart issues tend to be hit hardest. In most cases, disease progression is that of a typical but nasty flu, and patients usually recover within a week.
Infection can lead to serious complications such as bronchitis, pneumonia, or a worsening of existing heart or lung conditions. Hospitals report that many people exhibit symptoms for an extended period or become so sick that they have to be admitted.
"Unlike the common cold or regular flu, H3N2, which is a subtype of Influenza A, is often more severe and tends to last longer," Dr. Mayanka Lodha Seth of Redcliffe Labs told the Indian Express.
The infection becomes dangerous if the patient starts to have difficulty breathing or develops chest pains, their lips or nails turn blue, they become confused, or they are very dehydrated. Anyone experiencing these symptoms should get treatment immediately. They should also seek urgent medical assistance if they have a high fever after being treated for several days.


Necessary H3N2 precautions
As with the coronavirus, doctors recommend frequent hand-washing, masking, avoiding crowds, maintaining a balanced diet and getting the latest annual flu vaccine.
There is no specific therapy for H3N2. Doctors will usually treat the patient's symptoms with bed rest, plenty of fluids, and medicine to lower the fever. Serious cases and high-risk patients may be given anti-viral medication.
"The current seasonal H3N2 emerged from the 1968 influenza pandemic. It developed by combining with an avian H3 virus," said Dr. Martin Beer, vice president of the Friedrich Loeffler Institut (FLI), Germany's Federal Institute for Animal Health. "So the adaptation processes took place a long time ago, and the 'avian' components, like H3, are from that time."
Since then, numerous variants of the H3N2 subtype have circulated globally. They return periodically as waves of seasonal flu, often with regional genetic mutations. "Annual circulation and immune pressure result in the adaptation of seasonal flu viruses, and we respond to them with new vaccines. So these days, with the seasonal H3N2 virus, it's no longer a case of adaptation from avian to human, but of continual optimization within the human host," Beer told DW.

A study published in February 2024 examined changes in the receptor specificity of H3N2 influenza viruses from 1990 through 2000. It found that the binding behavior of the human H3N2 influenza virus to human receptors had changed over the last few decades, leading to an extension of the receptor-binding site. This extension makes it easier for the virus to adapt to new hosts or tissue, and can increase transmissibility. It also makes it easier for the virus to evade both immune defenses and treatments.
"Fifty years of evolution leave visible and comprehensible traces of adaptation," Beer said. "The first, and most important, shift happened 50 years ago, and led to the pandemic at the time. Since then, H3N2 has returned in seasonal waves and at differing levels of intensity. In some years, in some regions, it's very dominant compared to other influenza variants, which can lead to a correspondingly high number of cases."
Assessments by monitors and the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate that there is currently a low risk of a pandemic, provided there is no significant change in the structure of the virus and its transmission pathways. However, influenza viruses such as H3N2 are capable of mutating very quickly, so officials are remaining vigilant.
Should H3N2 mutate in such a way as to become more transmissible from human to human, or able to evade existing immunity, it could spread suddenly and quickly, which could lead to an epidemic or pandemic. Scientists therefore keep a very close eye on influenza viruses so they can react to worst-case scenarios.

Jerome A. Cohen, who pioneered the study of China’s opaque legal system, was one of the first foreign lawyers to practice in China and became a voice against human rights abuses there, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 95.


孔杰荣(Jerome A. Cohen)是研究不透明的中国法律体系的先驱人物，他是首批在中国执业的外国律师之一，并就中国的人权问题公开发声。他于上周一在曼哈顿家中去世，享年95岁。



His death was confirmed by his sons Ethan and Peter.


他的儿子伊森和彼得证实了他的死讯。



Mr. Cohen “created the field of the study of Chinese law in the United States,” Stephen Orlins, the president of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations and a former student and colleague of his, said in an interview. “It’s rare to find a field where in the beginning it was so shaped by one person.”


美中关系全国委员会会长、孔杰荣昔日的学生兼同事欧伦斯(Stephen Orlins)在接受采访时表示，孔杰荣“在美国开创了中国法律研究领域。很少有一个学科在起步阶段如此深刻地受到一位学者的塑造”。



Mr. Cohen originally appeared destined for a conventional, if illustrious, career as a law professor. After graduating from Yale Law School, he clerked for two Supreme Court justices and took a job at the law school of the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught mainstream topics.


孔杰荣最初似乎注定将拥有一个按部就班却辉煌的法律教授生涯。从耶鲁大学法学院毕业后，他先后担任两位最高法院大法官的书记员，随后在加州大学伯克利分校法学院任教，讲授法学中的主流议题。





But an opportunity arose for him to study the Chinese language and Chinese law, and he signed on, to the bafflement of some colleagues, at a time when China was convulsed by political revolution and Americans were generally banned from visiting the country.


但他遇到了一个学习中文和中国法律的机会，尽管当时中国正处于政治革命的动荡之中且基本禁止美国人访华，他仍毅然投身这一领域，这让一些同事感到不解。



After learning the language, Mr. Cohen interviewed people from mainland China who had fled to Hong Kong, to gain insights into how courts and prosecutors worked under Mao Zedong. He later established a program in East Asian law at Harvard Law School, where he was a member of the faculty from 1964 to 1979.


学习了中文之后，孔杰荣通过采访逃到香港的大陆人，深入了解毛泽东时代中国法院和检察机关的运作方式。他后来在哈佛大学法学院创立了东亚法律研究项目，1964年至1979年间在该院任教。

After Mao died and China began to court Western investment, Mr. Cohen took another career leap, to law firms. He advised foreign companies and educated Chinese officials who were hungry for knowledge about commercial law.


毛泽东去世后，中国开始寻求西方投资，孔杰荣的职业生涯再次转向，进入律师事务所工作。他为外国公司提供咨询服务，并为渴望了解商法的中国官员传授相关知识。



In 1990, Mr. Cohen began teaching at New York University, where he hosted lawyers, judges and human rights advocates from China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and elsewhere. Until his death, he remained vocal about China’s increasingly repressive turn under President Xi Jinping.


1990年，孔杰荣开始在纽约大学执教，期间接待了来自中国、台湾、日本、韩国及其他国家和地区的律师、法官和人权倡导者。直至去世前，他一直没有停止对习近平上台后中国日益严厉的政治压制的公开批评。



News of Mr. Cohen’s death prompted an outpouring of tributes from politicians, lawyers, academics and activists across Asia, many of whom owed a part of their careers — and even their freedom — to him. One tribute came from Xu Zhangrun, a law professor in China, who had Mr. Cohen’s loud support when he was forced out of his job and placed under heavy police surveillance after criticizing Mr. Xi.


孔杰荣逝世的消息传出后，亚洲多国的政界人士、律师、学者及活动人士纷纷发表悼文，其中许多人的职业生涯——甚至人身自由——都曾受惠于他。中国法学教授许章润便是其中之一，当年他因为批评习近平而被迫离职并遭受警方严密监视时，孔杰荣曾公开声援。



2002年，孔杰荣与妻子琼·勒博尔德·科恩在一次家庭旅行中登上中国长城。她曾学习中国历史与文化，后来成为一名艺术史学家、策展人、作家和摄影师。 Ethan Cohen

“His passing truly marks the end of an era,” Mr. Xu wrote in a eulogy published in the online journal China Heritage. “For Jerome Cohen, the idea of legal rights was always grounded in a respect for basic human rights.”


他的“久病仙逝，标志着一个时代的结束，”许章润在网络期刊《China Heritage》上发表的悼文中写道。“孔公希望播种法意以达公义，借助法权以捍卫人权。”



Jerome Alan Cohen was born on July 1, 1930, in Elizabeth, N.J., and raised in nearby Linden, the younger of two sons of Philip Cohen, a lawyer, and Beatrice (Kaufman) Cohen, a schoolteacher.


孔杰荣于1930年7月1日出生在新泽西州伊丽莎白市，在邻近的林登长大，是律师菲利普·科恩和教师比阿特丽斯·科恩（娘家姓考夫曼）夫妇的次子。



He excelled in high school and attended Yale University, where he majored in international relations before entering the law school there.


高中时期他成绩优异，后考入耶鲁大学，主修国际关系，之后又进入该校法学院深造。

While in college, he met Joan Lebold. They married in 1954. She survives him, as do his three sons, Ethan, Peter and Seth; seven grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.


在大学期间，他遇见了琼·勒博尔德，两人于1954年结婚。孔杰荣的遗属包括妻子琼、三个儿子伊森、彼得和塞斯，以及七个孙辈和六个曾孙辈。



In a memoir, “Eastward, Westward,” published this year, Mr. Cohen recalled the culture of antisemitism that kept him and other bright Jewish law students from winning summer internships at prestigious law firms.


在今年出版的回忆录《东行，西行》(Eastward, Westward)中，孔杰荣回忆起当年笼罩在法律界的反犹文化——这种歧视使他和其他优秀的犹太裔法学院学生无法获得顶尖律所的暑期实习机会。





But he found notable success anyway. After he graduated, he and his wife moved to Washington, where he clerked for Chief Justice Earl Warren and then for Justice Felix Frankfurter. He worked for the firm Covington & Burling and as a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney’s office for the District of Columbia before moving to Berkeley, where he began teaching in 1959, starting with classes on criminal law.


但他依然取得了卓越成就：毕业后与妻子移居华盛顿，先后担任首席大法官厄尔·沃伦与大法官费利克斯·弗兰克福特的书记员。他曾在科文顿·柏灵律师事务所执业，还曾在哥伦比亚特区联邦检察官办公室任检察官，随后到加州大学伯克利分校，于1959年开始执教，最初讲授刑法课程。



The next year, the law school asked Mr. Cohen if he could find a suitable candidate for a Rockefeller Foundation grant to study Chinese language and law. China was then largely closed off to Americans, and little was known about how its legal system operated. When Mr. Cohen could not find any takers, he began wondering if he should put himself forward.


次年，法学院请孔杰荣为洛克菲勒基金会物色合适人选，去研修中国语言与法律。当时中国对美国几乎完全封闭，其司法体系的运作模式鲜为人知。孔杰荣未能找到人选，于是开始考虑自己是否应该亲自上阵。

Some colleagues were skeptical. In his memoir, Mr. Cohen recalled the law school’s dean at the time, William L. Prosser, telling him, “Don’t throw away your career on China.”


一些同事对此持怀疑态度。孔杰荣在回忆录中提到，当时的法学院院长威廉·普罗瑟曾对他说：“不要把你的职业生涯浪费在中国上。”



But Mr. Cohen took the plunge. His wife, who had an interest in Asian art, began to study Chinese history and culture; she later worked as an art historian, curator, writer and photographer.


但孔杰荣仍毅然投身其中。对亚洲艺术怀有兴趣的妻子开始研习中国历史与文化，后来更成为艺术史学家、策展人、作家和摄影师。

After learning Chinese, Mr. Cohen moved with his family to Hong Kong in 1963. Documents dealing with China’s legal system were scarce, and he began to interview refugees from the mainland, including former police officers, to glean insights into how the law really worked. In 1968, he published a trailblazing study, “The Criminal Process in the People’s Republic of China, 1949-63.” In all, he edited, wrote or co-wrote more than a dozen books, many of them guides to law in China.


学习中文后，孔杰荣于1963年携家人移居香港。当时关于中国法律体系的文献极为匮乏，他着手采访来自大陆的难民，包括曾经的警察，以深入探究法律的实际运作。1968年，他出版了开创性研究著作《中华人民共和国刑事诉讼程序(1949-1963)》(The Criminal Process in the People’s Republic of China, 1949-63）。他累计主编、撰写或合著了十余部著作，其中多部是关于中国法律的指南读物。



“He showed the great value of paying attention to what’s going on in the ground, what’s really happening down there, as opposed to just relying on written materials,” Donald C. Clarke, an emeritus professor at the George Washington University Law School, said in an interview.


“他展现了关注现实层面以了解真实情况的重要价值，而非仅仅依赖书面材料，”乔治·华盛顿大学法学院荣休教授郭丹青(Donald C. Clarke)在采访中说。





Mr. Cohen moved on to Harvard and became involved in pressing for the United States to establish diplomatic relations with Beijing. He also yearned to visit the Chinese mainland; his unsuccessful attempts included written pleas and a proposal to purchase a panda for an American zoo.


孔杰荣后来转赴哈佛大学，并积极参与推动美国与北京建立外交关系。他亦渴望亲身前往中国大陆，曾多次尝试未果——包括提出书面请求，以及为一座美国动物园购买一只大熊猫的提议。



His chance finally came in 1972, when he joined a small delegation of scholars who visited Beijing and other cities. Mr. Cohen recalled struggling to chat with wary residents over bowls of soy milk at a breakfast eatery. The highlight of the trip was a dinner with China’s premier, Zhou Enlai.


1972年，机会终于降临，他加入一个规模不大的学者代表团，访问了北京等城市。他忆及在一家早餐店与警惕的当地民众喝着豆浆艰难攀谈的情景。此行最精彩的部分则是与周恩来总理共进晚宴。



1972年，作为一个学者代表团的成员访华期间，孔杰荣在北京见到了中华人民共和国总理周恩来。 Jerome A. Cohen archive

“I understand that you have done many books on our legal system,” Mr. Cohen recalled Mr. Zhou telling him, with a tone that “gently implied that perhaps I had made more of China’s legal system than China had.”


“我知道你写了很多关于我们法律体系的著作，”孔杰荣回忆周恩来当时对他说道，语气中“隐约暗示，我对中国法律体系的描述恐怕与现实不符”。



After Mao died and China’s leaders began to welcome more foreign visitors and investment, Mr. Cohen’s knowledge of Chinese law was in demand from international companies. He began to give lectures to Chinese officials who were eager to learn how to draft contracts, commercial laws and tax rules.


毛泽东去世后，中国领导人开始欢迎更多国外来客和投资，孔杰荣在中国法律领域的学识因此备受跨国公司青睐。他还开始为渴望学习如何起草合同、商法和税法规章的中国官员开设讲座。



Mr. Cohen decided to leave his position at Harvard and practice law full time. In 1981 he joined the firm Paul Weiss, and he encouraged young lawyers to focus their careers on China. Many of them have recalled his bustling enthusiasm, his generosity in helping students and young lawyers, and the bow tie he often wore.


孔杰荣决定离开哈佛教职，全职从事法律实践工作。1981年他加入宝维斯律师事务所，并鼓励年轻律师将中国作为事业重心。许多人至今仍记得他风风火火的热情、提携后辈的慷慨胸怀，以及他常佩戴的领结。



In these years he and his wife spent much of their time in China, where he was involved in drafting contracts, advising companies and settling commercial disputes.


在宝维斯工作期间，他和妻子大部分时间都在中国度过，参与合同起草、企业咨询，以及商业纠纷的调解。



“He had a thirst to learn,” said Yvonne Y.F. Chan, whom Mr. Cohen recruited to Paul Weiss. “We’d be in these grueling negotiations and he’d ask these questions that might even go off on a tangent, because he was so curious to understand where the other side was coming from.”


“他始终怀抱着求知的渴望，”由孔杰荣招进宝维斯律师事务所的伊冯·陈回忆道，“即使在艰苦的谈判中，他也会提出些看似偏离主题的追问，只因他迫切想要理解对方的立场。”

Mr. Cohen retired from Paul Weiss in 2000, but until 2020 he remained a professor at N.Y.U., where he founded the U.S.-Asia Law Institute. He continued to visit China and occasionally took on cases, including that of Zhao Yan, a researcher for The New York Times who was imprisoned on charges of fraud in 2006 after prosecutors dropped their initial accusation that he had stolen state secrets.


孔杰荣于2000年从宝维斯律师事务所退休，但一直担任纽约大学教授至2020年，他在该校创办了美亚法律研究中心。他持续造访中国，并偶尔接手案件，包括曾为《纽约时报》研究员赵岩辩护——该案在检方撤回“泄漏国家机密”的最初指控后，在2006年以欺诈罪判决赵岩入狱。



Mr. Cohen also took a deep interest in the plight of two Chinese legal and human rights activists, Xu Zhiyong and Ding Jiaxi, who were given long prison terms in 2023 on charges of subversion of state power; and of Chen Guangcheng, a blind legal activist who fled detention in his home village and took refuge in the American Embassy in Beijing before flying to the United States in 2012.


孔杰荣亦深切关注中国维权律师和人权活动人士许志永和丁家喜的困境。这两人于2023年因“颠覆国家政权罪”被判处长期徒刑。他同样关心陈光诚的遭遇，这位盲人维权律师曾在家乡遭到软禁，后逃入北京的美国大使馆，并于2012年飞往美国。





“He organized a seminar to make sure that people paid attention to the case,” Mr. Ding’s wife, Sophie Luo, said in an interview. “He put me in touch with people and organized resources. He didn’t want them to be forgotten.”


“他曾组织过一次研讨会，以确保人们关注这个案件，”丁家喜的妻子罗胜春在采访中说，“他帮我联系到很多人并整合资源，他不希望他们被人遗忘。”



Mr. Cohen often lamented China’s increasingly repressive policies under Mr. Xi. But he rejected despair.


孔杰荣时常感叹习近平上台后中国日益严厉的政策，但他拒绝陷入绝望。



“I’m not totally pessimistic, as some people are,” he said in an interview published last year in the digital newsmagazine The Wire China. “China’s development has been pendulum-like. At the moment, we’re in a repressive period. That won’t last. It can’t last.”


“我不像一些人那样完全陷入悲观，”他在去年接受数字新闻杂志《The Wire China》采访时说。“中国的发展就像钟摆一样。眼下我们正处于一个高压时期。但这种情况不会持久，也不可能持久。”

 US considering sending Ukraine Tomahawk missiles — Vance
    
The United States is considering Ukraine's request to obtain long-range Tomahawk missiles for its continued defensive efforts to push back against Russia, Vice President JD Vance said.
After meeting President Donald Trump durning the United Nations General Assembly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked the US to sell Tomahawks to European nations that would send them to Ukraine.
Vance said on Fox News Sunday that Trump would make the "final determination" on whether to allow the deal.
"We're certainly looking at a number of requests from the Europeans," Vance added.
Tomahawk missiles have a range of 2,500 km (1,550 miles).

In the past, Trump has denied Ukraine's requests for use of long-range missiles but the US leader has grown increasingly frustrated at Russian President Vladimir Putin's refusal to reach a peace deal.
Vance posited during the interview Russia has made little in the way of territorial gains recently.
"We've been actively pursuing peace from the very beginning of the administration, but the Russians have got to wake up and accept reality here. A lot of people are dying. They don't have a lot to show for it," he said.

 Russia pounds Ukraine with deadly missile barrage
    
Officials say Ukraine fended off a nightlong assault of hundreds of drones and missiles that killed at least four people in Kyiv, including a 12-year-old girl.
Russia launched one of its most sustained attacks on Ukraine’s capital since the war began, firing 48 missiles and nearly 600 drones overnight, Ukrainian officials said.
Kyiv’s military reported shooting down 43 missiles and 568 drones. However, at least four people were killed and dozens injured in the attack, which lasted more than 12 hours. Factories, residential buildings and a cardiology clinic were all damaged during the assault.
"Moscow wants to continue fighting and killing and deserves only the harshest pressure from the world," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after the strikes. 
"The Kremlin benefits from continuing this war and terror as long as there are profits from energy sales," he added, urging stronger measures against Russia from Kyiv's allies. 
Neighboring Poland briefly closed parts of its airspace and scrambled fighter jets until the threat passed.
Ukrainian authorities said more than 40 people were wounded across the Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Sumy, Cherkasy and Mykolaiv regions.

 German general says Ukraine now strikes deeper into Russia
   
Dmytro Hubenko
   
Ukraine has sharply improved its ability to hit military targets inside Russia, German Major General Maik Keller told the dpa news agency, citing gains in personnel, equipment and training.
"The Ukrainians are getting better at reaching militarily relevant targets in Russia's depth. This is a question of capability, and capability means personnel, material and training," said Keller, deputy commander of the NATO Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine (NSATU) mission based in Wiesbaden, Germany.
NSATU coordinates support from 30 nations, including partners Australia, New Zealand and Ukraine itself, to meet Kyiv's needs for weapons, ammunition, spare parts and equipment while aligning its forces with NATO standards. Keller noted that the learning is mutual, with Ukraine’s advances in drone warfare — covering combat, logistics and medical evacuation — setting an example.
"Our core mission is to coordinate support for Ukraine," he said. "But we would be foolish not to use this knowledge to improve ourselves and spare our own soldiers from repeating Ukraine's hard lessons."
His comments came as Berlin pledged €300 million ($351 million) to help Ukraine produce thousands of long-range drones, following a wave of Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil refineries and other critical infrastructure.

 NATO to beef up Baltic presence after drone incidents
    
NATO has announced a upgrade to its mission in the Baltic Sea following a series of drone-related incidents in Denmark.
Over the past week, mysterious drones not only appeared over Copenhagen airport, but were also spotted near five other airports and Danish military installations.
The alliance said that the increased presence in the region would include  "intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms and at least one
Moscow has denied involvement in the incidents, which also include drones spotted above the airport in Oslo, Norway.
NATO has also sworn to use "all necessary military and non-military tools" to defend itself after Russian fighter jets were spotted over Estonian airspace for 12 minutes.

 Paralympic body drops Russia, Belarus ban
    
The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) lifted all sanctions on Russia and Belarus at the summit in Seoul, South Korea on Saturday.
The ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes had been in place since the Russian invasion of Ukrain began in 2022.
Ukraine's Sports Minister, Matviy Bidnyi, denounced the decision, claiming that those who voted for it had betrayed "their conscience and the Olympic values."

 Report: Ukraine hits major Russian oil depot
    
A Ukrainian security official told Reuters new agency that long-range drones had struck a key oil pumping station in Russia's Chuvashia region.
The drones had caused a fire and resulted in the station suspending operations, the official said.
Russia's oil sector has long been considered key to its war machine, as many nations around the world, including some EU members, keep financing Moscow by purchasing cheap Russian oil and gas.

 Zelenskyy: Ukraine received Patriot system from Israel
    
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced on Saturday that his military had received a US-made Patriot anti-aircraft system from Israel, and that it had already been in operation for a month.
He also said that Kyiv would be getting two more Patriot launchers this autumn, but did not specify where they were coming from.
The move was seen as somewhat of a surprise. Ukraine has voted in favor of UN resolutions calling for an end to Israeli occupation of some of the Palestinian territories.
While the Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent some humanitarian aid to Ukraine early in the conflict, Netanyahu has refused to follow suit on Western sanctions against Russia.
Moreover, it sided with Russia against Ukraine on a UN resolution reaffirming Ukraine's territorial integrity.
More recently however, Netanyahu's government has distanced itself from Moscow as Russia pursues closer ties with Iran. 

Could US Patriot systems be a gamechanger for Ukraine?

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Denmark is closing its entire airspace to civilian drones. The ban comes as the Nordic country prepares to host European leaders after a flurry of suspicious drone activity in recent days.
    With European leaders set to gather in Copenhagen next week, the Transport Ministry announced a ban on all civilian drone flights from Monday through Friday Image: Steven Knap/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP/Getty Images   
Denmark on Sunday ordered a ban on civil drone flights, after several unmanned aerial vehicles were witnessed at military facilities overnight, following a week in which drone sorties caused the temporary closures of several airports in the Nordic country.
The Danish military said it had deployed "several capacities" in response to the overnight drone sightings.
Earlier this week, drones forced Denmark to close its airports, including Copenhagen Airport, which was closed for nearly four hours on Monday.
Denmark has called the drones part of a "hybrid attack" but the government has stopped short of saying definitively who it believes is behind the missions.
Nevertheless, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has said Russia is the main "country that poses a threat to European security."
"We are currently in a difficult security situation, and we must ensure the best possible working conditions for the armed forces and the police when they are responsible for security during the EU summit," Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said in a statement on Sunday.

When will the drone ban be and why?
Civilian drones will be banned from Danish airspace from Monday through Friday of the coming week.
The Nordic country holds the rotating European Council presidency for the second half of 2025. Denmark will host EU leaders on Wednesday, followed by a summit on Thursday of the wider, 47-member European Political Community, set up to unite the bloc with other friendly European countries after Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
A German air defense frigate arrived in Copenhagen on Sunday to assist with airspace surveillance.

Is Russia behind the drone activity?
It is not clear who is behind the drone missions but Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte have both said the notion of Russia being the perpetrator could not be ruled out.
Meanwhile, the Russian embassy in Denmark last week rejected claims of Moscow's involvement.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Data from the Turkish Health Ministry reveal serious deficiencies in both the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. The International Diabetes Federation says Turkey has the highest prevalence of diabetes in the region.
    Obesity is one of the main risk factors for developing diabetes Image: DHA   
Over the past 20 years, there has been a 67% rise in diabetes cases in Turkey, meaning that overall prevalence has almost doubled, to more than 16% of the population. The International Diabetes Federation now lists Turkey as the country with the highest diabetes prevalence in the European region. 
According to data from the World Health Organization's (WHO)Global Health Observatory, the age-standardized prevalence of diabetes in Turkey in 2022 was 16.6% of the adult population (aged over 18): 16% of men and 17.1% of women. In comparison, the EU average is about 7–8%. Rates in Turkey are thus almost double the European median.
These statistics follow a consistent trend. WHO data shows that diabetes in Turkey has been steadily increasing for the past 20 years. In 2002, the age-standardized prevalence in people over 18 was 9.9%. In 2008, it was 11.4%, rising to 14.1% in 2015, 15.9% in 2020, and 16.6% in 2022.
Around one in six people are now affected. The risk is particularly apparent in people over the age of 30. In this group, the prevalence is 22.2% — more than one in five. Rates in the European Union in 2022 were far lower: 2.7% in France, 6.6% in Germany, and 7.2% in Italy.

Criticism of Turkey's health policy
Experts in the field say the responsibility for this negative development lies primarily with politicians. "The biggest problem behind the rise is food policy," says Kayihan Pala, a parliamentarian with the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) who is also a professor of public health. "The health ministry is not living up to its responsibilities."
In Pala's view, the main reasons for the increase in cases of diabetes are not genetic factors, but lifestyle and diet: lack of exercise, as well as the consumption of large quantities of carbohydrates and various sugars.
According to a 2014 OECD report, around 45% of those diagnosed as diabetic knew nothing about their illness. This indicates that millions more remain undiagnosed or are diagnosed late. A conspicuously high number of people in Turkey are admitted to hospital with what's called uncontrolled diabetes, when poor management of the condition leads to various complications. This ratio was 402.6 for every 100,000 inhabitants — eight-and-a-half times the OECD average of 47.3.
The latest OECD figures from 2023 show no improvement. While the number of people with diabetes in Turkey remains far higher than average, the reverse is true for the statistics of successful treatment. Kayihan Pala says this demonstrates the failure of the Turkish health system. Early diagnosis and systematic control of the disease are urgently needed, he says, as is the political will to encourage changes in lifestyle.

Survey reveals inadequate treatment
A study done by the Turkish health ministry confirms the OECD's findings: Many newly diagnosed patients have high levels of blood sugar. How well the disease is kept under control also varies. A patient's age, gender, and region of living may all make a difference. Women and men in low-income regions are especially disadvantaged. Diabetes is therefore not just a medical, but also a social and economic problem.
Pala says the situation will not change without improved medical care and better provision of medication. "Some patients have difficulty accessing their medications," he says. "And post-diagnosis communication between patients and doctors is often poor."

Obesity and ineffective campaigns
Pala believes combating obesity would prove decisive in reducing the prevalence of diabetes, but that Turkey's strategies for doing this are insufficient. Although obesity is one of the most important risk factors, the measures being implemented by the health ministry are not yet providing permanent solutions.

The ministry has now presented an action plan for the next three years. It aims to encourage healthy eating, regulate canteens in schools and offices, and increase physical activity. Some 7.7 million people were assessed as part of a campaign entitled "Discover your ideal weight, live healthily." However, the results were not published, nor were regional variations in the prevalence of obesity made known.
According to the WHO European Regional Obesity Report 2022, the percentage of people in Turkey who are overweight and obese is the highest in Europe, with 66.8% of the population falling into this category.


Debate around starch-based sugars
Turkey's food standards are contributing to the problem. Statutory requirements for healthy nutrition are inadequate, and there are no restrictions on the advertising of unhealthy foods.
The Turkish food scientist Bulent Sik described the problem in an interview with DW: "The increase in the consumption of cheap, easily available snacks and sugary soft drinks is directly linked to the increase in obesity. As long as the production of these goods is not restricted, many measures are no more than symbolic policies," he said.
Public health expert Kayihan Pala points to starch-based sugars as another contributing factor. "It's scientifically proven that consuming large quantities of corn syrup, which is high in fructose, increases the prevalence of type 2 diabetes. People who aren't obese are also more likely to get sick if they consume these sugars," he warns.
The issue of starch-based sugars has been under discussion in Turkey for years. The country's Sugar Law, passed in 2001, established production quotas of 10%. In 2008, the quota was raised to 15%, and in subsequent years it went up as high as 50%. In 2018, it was lowered again to 5%. Since then, following a decree from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, it has dropped to 2.5%.

Children and school meals
Pala is calling for a fundamental policy shift in diabetes prevention in Turkey. "We need science-based, socially far-reaching programs for nutrition, prevention, and the fight against diabetes and obesity. Show projects alone won't get us anywhere."
The problem must be nipped in the bud, says Pala. Measures to combat diabetes have to focus on children, too. Healthy nutrition in childhood is a decisive factor. Pala is calling for free school meals for all children, describing it as one of the most effective measures in combating obesity and the risk of diabetes.

Residents of Zurich decided Sunday to severely restrict the use of leaf blowers and leaf vacuums.  
More than 61% of voters supported the restrictive rules, which authorities said would limit noise and dust pollution. 
Gas-powered leaf blowers and leaf vacuums will be fully banned in Zurich, Switzerland's most populous city.
Only electric devices will be used to blow away dirt and debris. This will only be possible from October to December, three months out of the year.
According to authorities, special permission will be required to use the devices at other times, and permission will only be granted under exceptional circumstances.

What Zurich residents are saying about the ban on leaf blowers
Supporters of the move complained that leaf blowers and leaf vacuums are loud and spread fine dust, causing both noise and air pollution.
They also claim that the devices are harmful for microorganisms such as bacteria, and recommend using rakes to remove leaves and trash.
Opponents of the ban, however, had said the proposed ban would make life unnecessarily difficult for many people.
They believed the vote was "an expression of a nonsensical and anti-social culture of prohibition."

 SPD loses Dortmund mayoral vote
    
The Social Democrats (SPD) in Germany's local elections lost the Ruhr metropolis of Dortmund on Sunday, which had been governed by the party for almost 80 years.
Incumbent SPD Mayor Thomas Westphal lost a neck-and-neck race against Christian Democratic Union (CDU) challenger Alexander Omar Kalouti.
According to preliminary results, Kalouti won 52.92% of the vote, while Westphal received 47.08% of the vote.
In contrast, the SPD was able to hope for a victory in the state's largest city, Cologne. There, SPD politician and former sports official Torsten Burmester led the way over Berivan Aymaz of the Greens.
Incumbent Mayor Henriette Reker (independent) did not run for re-election after two terms in office.
In the state capital of North Rhine-Westphalia, Düsseldorf, a victory for the CDU was on the cards. There, the incumbent mayor, Stephan Keller (CDU), was ahead of Green Party politician Clara Gerlach.
In all three mayoral runoff elections in North Rhine-Westphalia that included the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, candidates from other parties won.
The AfD lost to Social Democratic Party (SPD) candidates in Gelsenkirchen and Duisburg, while the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) secured the top seat in Hagen.
The SPD is the junior partner in Germany's coalition government, which is led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz of the CDU.

 Counting begins in run-off local elections in North Rhine-Westphalia
    
The polls have closed, and the vote counting has begun for the runoff local elections in the western German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
Runoff elections were held in almost 150 municipalities, in places where none of the candidates received more than half of the votes in the first round two weeks ago.
Several mayors and district administrators have yet to be elected. In Cologne, candidates from the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and Green Party are competing against each other.
In Duisburg, Gelsenkirchen, and Hagen, however, candidates from the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party advanced to the second round and will face candidates from the SPD or Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
In Dortmund, which has been governed by the SPD for nearly 80 years, candidates from both parties, SPD and CDU, reached the second round.

 Trapeze artist dies in fall at Bautzen circus show
    
A 27-year-old Spanish trapeze artist fell about five meters during an afternoon performance in Bautzen, Saxony, and died in the ring as nearly 100 spectators — including many children — looked on, police said on Sunday.
"The crisis intervention team was immediately on site and supported guests and circus staff," police spokesman Stefan Heiduck said. Authorities are treating the incident as a workplace accident and have found no signs of foul play.
Ralf Huppertz, head of the Association of German Circus Companies, called it a "tragic accident," noting that "artists accept certain risks they calculate and understand." 
He suggested the performer "must have fallen very unluckily or onto an obstacle," since five meters is not usually dangerous for trained artists.
Bautzen Mayor Karsten Vogt expressed his condolences: "On behalf of the city, I extend my sincere sympathy to the relatives and those affected by this terrible accident. Our thoughts are with the families and everyone impacted."

 Germany to begin direct deportation talks with Taliban
    
The German government plans to open direct negotiations with Afghanistan's Taliban authorities on deportations, Germany's Bild am Sonntag newspaper has reported, citing the Interior Ministry in Berlin.
"Deportations to Afghanistan must be able to take place regularly! That’s why we are now negotiating directly in Kabul so that criminals and dangerous individuals can be consistently deported in the future," Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt told the newspaper.
According to the report, Interior Ministry officials will travel to Kabul in October to discuss returning Afghan nationals convicted of crimes or deemed security threats. Deportations are expected to use regular commercial flights rather than chartered planes.

 Tens of thousands take part in Gaza solidarity protest in Berlin

Thousands of people marched through central Berlin on Saturday, chanting for "international solidarity" and a "free Palestine."
The "All Eyes on Gaza" protest began outside city hall in the German capital and marched through the Tiergarten park.
Organized by some 50 groups, including the Left party, they were calling for a broad arms embargo against Israel. They were also demanding EU sanctions against the Israeli government for what many international organizations, including the United Nations, have called a genocide being carried out against Palestinians in Gaza.
Organizers said the demonstration drew more than 100,000 people to the streets of central Berlin, marking the largest Gaza rally the capital has seen to date.
In the early evening, a police spokeswoman estimated the crowd size at around 60,000, though she did not rule out a larger number.
A smaller, unaffiliated demonstration of about 1,200 people in the Berlin district of Kreuzberg was disbanded after police said that crimes had been committed by participants. This included causing bodily harm and the use of explosive materials, according to police.
Several other German cities, such as Düsseldorf, saw smaller solidarity protests throughout the afternoon.

 Few doctors use digital patient files
    
Beginning in October, German doctors' practices will be required to use electronic patient files (ePA). This is meant to help doctors communicate better about a patient's needs and medical history  and to provide people living in Germany easier access to their health information.
However, a new survey by a medical newspaper of two major insurers, AOK and DAK, found that of their 50 million customers with electronic records, only 1.5 million had access to them.
The survey also revealed that many doctors' offices across the country lack the necessary technological infrastructure to run the ePA program.
Patients have long complained that the administrative side ofthe German medical system feels severely outdated. It relies on physical letters, paper prescriptions and referrals, and fax machines.

A visibly jovial Schwarzenegger took to the bandstand at the Marstall tent, one of several at the annual three-week-long party, to rousing applause. 
Clad in a traditional Bavarian leather jacket with horn buttons, but sporting jeans rather than Lederhosen, Schwarzenegger posed for selfies with band members after his turn as conductor. 
Schwarzenegger, a native of neighboring Austria, has visited the event numerous times in the past.
Oktoberfest, the largest event of its kind in the world, attracts some 6 million visitors annually and runs from September 20 until October 5 this year.

 Germany mulls giving army new powers to shoot down drones - reports
    
The German tabloid newspaper Bild on Saturday reported that Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt is working on a proposal to allow the Bundeswehr, Germany's army, to shoot down unmanned drones over the country as a last resort in certain situations.
Germany's Rheinische Post also carried similar quotes  by Dobrindt.
The push comes on the heels of numerous incursions into NATO countries' airspace by suspected Russian drones. These have caused property damage and closed airports. The most recent incidents involve drones over Danish military installations and incursions into German airspace in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein last Friday.
According to Bild, Dobrindt's plan would give last resort powers to the Bundeswehr when human lives or key infrastructure are at risk and no other effective options remain. 
An Interior Ministry spokesperson said that police remain responsible for illegal drones over sites such as train stations and airports but noted the new approach would allow all parties involved to adjust to the "dynamic threat situation."
"We are not only experiencing a turning point in military security, but also in civil defence and civil protection as a whole," he was quoted by the Rheinische Post as saying.
Dobrindt said he aims to create a drone defense network that would enable the close coordination of local, state and federal agencies.
Germany's GdP police union spoke out against the proposed change, noting that the police alone are responsible for domestic protection.

 German foreign minister to give UNGA address
    
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul will address the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
While in New York this week, the German diplomat has advocated for Berlin's return to the Security Council as a non-permanent member — Austria and Portugal are also angling for one of the two seats when they become available in 2026.
Moreover, Wadephul has said that African and Latin American representatives should be given more say in the body.   
In the longterm, Germany is seeking to become a permanent Security Council member.
Wadephul is scheduled to address the General Assembly shortly after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, whose country has been increasingly aggressive in its provocations against European NATO states during the execution of its ongoing invasion of neighboring Ukraine.

 Interior minister says Berlin wants deportation deal with Syria
    
German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt on Saturday said Berlin hopes to strike a deportation deal with the Syrian government by year's end.
The deal will focus on the repatriation of Syrians who have been denied asylum yet remain in Germany. 
"We want to reach an agreement with Syria this year and initially deport criminals, followed later by those without legal residence," Dobrindt said in remarks published in the regional Rheinische Post newspaper.
"It is important to distinguish between people who are well integrated and working, and those without asylum rights who rely on social benefits," he continued, adding that talks would begin "shortly."
How many Syrians are in Germany?
Germany has not deported anyone to Syria since 2012. 
Dobrindt said he has instructed the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) to partially resume the review of paused asylum applications in order to determine who can stay and who must be deported.
Though numbers remain low, Germany's Interior Ministry said that 1,867 people had voluntarily returned to Syria between the fall of Bashar Assad last December and the end of August.
About 955,000 Syrian nationals are currently living in Germany according to BAMF's Central Register of Foreigners (AZR), with Interior Department data documenting that about 83,150 had become German citizens in 2024.
Berlin also keen on Afghans' deportation, Dobrindt says
Dobrindt said he also aims to establish "regular and systematic" deportations to Afghanistan.
To date, Berlin has only been able to deport criminal Afghans with the help of intermediary Qatar since Germany has no formal diplomatic ties to the ruling Taliban.
Human rights and refugee organizations criticized the two deportation flights Germany has carried out to Afghanistan so far, saying the country is unsafe under the hardline Islamist Taliban, who returned to power in 2021.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The separatist strip of land in eastern Moldova is, in effect, an exclave of Russia — and a base for the Kremlin's forces.
    The coat of arms of Transnistria displays Soviet symbols Image: Sergei Gapon/AFP   
Located between Ukraine and the EU member Romania, Moldova has received increased international media coverage since Russia's full-scale war invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. In addition to coverage of pro-EU and pro-Russia parties battling for parliamentary control, there has been increased international reporting on the internationally unrecognized Kremlin-aligned Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova.
Meaning "land beyond the Dniester," the name Transnistria refers to the area along the eastern lower reaches of the Dniester River. At the end of the 18th century, the region it was annexed by the Russian Empire. During the Soviet era, Transnistria was initially part of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Josef Stalin created the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic after annexing Bessarabia in 1940 as a result of his nonaggression pact with Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany. The area now known as Transnistria is a strip of land about 200 kilometers (120 miles) long and only a few kilometers wide in places along the left bank of the Dniester River. It makes up about 10% of the territory of Moldova.


An estimated 360,000 people live in Transnistria, about 13% of Moldova's total population of 2.8 million. According to a 2015 census, 29.1% of inhabitants identified as Russian, 28.6% as Moldovan and 22.9% as Ukrainian; 14% did not provide information about their ethnicity.
Travel to and from Transnistria is possible, but is monitored and controlled by illegal "border checks" carried out by police and Russian soldiers. Journalists are not officially allowed to enter the country. Inside the territory, residents are subject to rigorous surveillance.

Post-Soviet Russian war
As part of a broad national revival movement in the late 1980s, reform-minded members of the Moldavian Soviet Republic's Communist Party — the majority of whom were Romanian speakers — determined that a Stalin-era decree was outdated and Romanian, then still called Moldovan, could once again be written in Latin script instead of Cyrillic, and declared Moldovan to be an official language alongside Russian.

Many non-Romanian-speaking people feared that Moldova would reunify with Romania. In September 1990, some Communists, mostly Russians, proclaimed a new Soviet republic on the narrow strip of land on the left bank of the Dniester River, which they later christened the Transnistrian Moldovan Republic. To this day, no country, not even Russia, has recognized the territory. 
The Republic of Moldova gained independence from the Soviet Union in August 1991. Fighting between forces loyal to the forces of the government of the new independent Moldova and Soviet-aligned separatists — supported by the 14th Russian Army, numerous "volunteer fighters" from Russia and Russian weapons — broke out in the spring of 1992. The fighting was not considered a civil war, as the vast majority of Moldovans, including in Transnistria itself, did not support the separatists. Rather, it was Russia's first post-Soviet war against a country that had freed itself from the empire. In 1999, at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) summit in Istanbul, Russia committed to withdrawing its troops from Transnistria, but has never followed through.


Transnistria's political system
The separatists have maintained and expanded a Soviet-style dictatorship in Transnistria. The ruling Renewal party holds 29 seats in the 33-member Supreme Council, with the other four occupied by "independent" deputies. Former army officer and Supreme Council member Vadim Krasnoselsky has been president of Transnistria since 2016.

There is no independent media, and human and civil rights are systematically violated. Romanian written in Latin script is banned. Numerous people have been held as political prisoners since 1992, the most well-known being the group around anti-communist Moldovan activist Ilie Ilascu, who was incarcerated from 1992 to 2001. Moldovan citizens from outside Transnistria are often kidnapped under false pretenses in the "republic" and used for blackmail.
Transnistria serves primarily as a military and operational base for Russian secret services and state structures. It is also a hub for money laundering. Widespread electoral fraud via vote buying in Moldova is carried out through Russian banks there.
The region is effectively controlled by an oligarchic group led by former KGB officer Viktor Gushan, who in 1993 co-founded the Sheriff holding company, which has a monopoly in nearly all economic sectors of Transnistria. Gushan and his business partners also own an international network of offshore companies.

Transnistria is an important Russian military base with access to southwestern Ukraine and Moldova. An estimated 1,500 Russian soldiers are stationed in the region. A large former Soviet weapons arsenal containing about 20,000 tons of ammunition and weapons is stored near the village of Cobasna in the north.
Until early 2025, Transnistria was financed primarily through Russian gas supplies to Moldova. Gas paid for by the Moldovan company Moldovagaz was used to generate electricity in Transnistria at the Cuciurgan power plant on the border with Ukraine, which Transnistria then sold back to Moldova. In effect, Russia and Moldova were financing the regime in Transnistria. The region is also connected to the Russian banking system. Additionally, Transnistria exports steel and metal products, textiles and agricultural goods almost exclusively to countries in the European Union. To export goods, companies must register with the customs authorities in Moldova.

Negotiations to find a solution to the Transnistria conflict have been ongoing since 1993 — including the "5+2 format,” which brings together representatives of Moldova, Transnistria, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, plus the EU and US — but the Kremlin has prevented the region's reintegration into the rest of the country. Now that Russian gas supplies to Moldova have been suspended via a Ukrainian transit stop since 2025, the territory's most important source of financing has been lost, leading to speculation about a possible collapse of the regime. However, the government of Moldova has no interest in escalation and would not have the military capabilities to enforce such a transition.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[风靡半年的“外卖大战”悄悄降温了，外卖商家的烦恼还在继续。
 
一个月前，沈阳的一位外卖商家李优在写字楼旁边新开了一家快餐店，以牛肉饭为主营产品，他很清楚，花钱促销、投流推广是必经之路。
 
一家外卖平台的业务经理找到他，推荐他参与“赏金联盟”活动，活动一级页面显示了6%的赏金比例，意味着平台帮助商家“高效获取用户优质反馈”，同时收取6%抽成。
 
然而，当他点击“新店爆单必选”的二级页面报名时，却未留意到，这项活动的赏金比例为70%—100%。店铺日均出10单，半个月后，他发现这项支出扣除了他1000多元，才意识到抽成比例之高。
 
“最大的感受就是不透明。”他告诉《中国新闻周刊》，除了认为业务经理有诱导行为，他更想弄明白：烧钱换来的流量和订单，究竟哪些是真实的？
 
这类问题，已经引起重视。9月24日，市场监管总局组织起草的《外卖平台服务管理基本要求（征求意见稿）》公开征求意见，有专家评价其为行业“新国标”。征求意见稿重点规范了平台和商户价格促销行为，以遏制“裹挟式”竞争、过度“价格战”等乱象。

“算不清账”
 
李优坦言，刚注册的外卖新店家，对于如何运营、推广、投流很陌生，也成为平台外卖业务经理和第三方外卖运营商眼中的“香饽饽”。
 
若没有参加任何活动，一旦有几天销量情况不好，就有业务经理打来电话：“您的店铺权重下降了，订单量很低，如果不参加活动，可能店就废了。”李优表示，他感到恐慌，选择开通对方推荐的活动以求自救。
 
参与上述抽成70%—100%的赏金联盟活动后，李优每一单的绝大部分收入都被抽走了。据他出示的截图，收入21.55元、24.64元的外卖订单，都被活动抽走了20元。
 
此外，他还投了用户取消、食品安全理赔保险，每单固定扣除0.14元。他表示，买保险前，有时会发生2—3单没有骑手接单的情况，商家要自行承担损失，购买保险后，再没出现过类似情况。
 
他明白，商家参与这些活动是“砸钱烧流量”。令他更为困惑的是，如何辨别这些项目的运营效果。“光从营业额看，商家无法详细拆分出哪些是自然流量带来的效益，哪些是运营推广带来的额外的效益。”他举例道，赏金联盟活动为店铺拉来了很多好评，但他无法确定是不是真实订单。
 
“业务经理在介绍项目的时候，不会说得特别清楚，尤其是活动的副作用，自己实践了才能体会。”他说。
 
另有外卖商家对《中国新闻周刊》反映，甚至有外卖平台的业务经理会在未经商家同意的情况下，为商家账户开通各类促销活动。
 
认为业务经理存在诱导行为后，李优打电话向平台反映，客服表示会调出通话记录。两天后，客服表示“业务量太大，找不到通话录音”，承诺会向上反映，帮他申请赔付，要求耐心等待。最后，对方回复“申请被驳回了，实在没办法”。

“倒贴”推广
 
开新店以前，李优还经营着一家加盟型鸭货店。附近一条街上共有6家兼做堂食和外卖的店铺，有3家在今年倒闭了。回忆起过去几个月的“外卖大战”，他心有余悸。
 
他指出，消费者仅需几元点外卖的背后，是价值12—18元的大额膨胀券、优惠券，这些券的部分成本都由选择参与促销活动的商家承担。
 
为了跟上流量，李优的鸭货店参与了促销活动。“通常情况下，一张18元的券，平台承担5元，店铺需承担13元。幸运的是，鸭货平均客单价高，大约四五十元，我还负担得起。”他感叹，折算下来，挣到的钱没太大变化，只是店员的工作量大幅增加了。
 
“对比房租，来自平台的压力更大。”汪希在武汉经营着一家独立咖啡店，他告诉《中国新闻周刊》，每月的租金为5000元，营业额约3万—4万元，扣除平台各项费用后，每月到手只有一万多元，“几乎拿走了一半”。
 
汪希还有商家朋友经历过“负金额订单”的冲击。例如，一则7月的订单截图显示，初始订单金额为32.7元，扣除商家活动支出25.8元、佣金和配送服务费10元之后，商家最终到手只有-3.1元。
 
中国信息通信研究院政策与经济研究所副所长李强治在接受央视采访时指出：近年来，随着平台收费规则、计费方式、包括补贴要求等越来越复杂，常常导致商户出现看不懂、弄不明、算不清的情况，难以准确判断成本投入和收入预期，甚至出现卖得越多、亏得越多的局面。
 
新的规范
 
商家们的“烦恼”，已经引起了政策重视。
 
9月24日起，《外卖平台服务管理基本要求（征求意见稿）》公开征求意见。文件规定了外卖平台的总体要求、价格行为管理要求、商户管理、配送员权益保障等服务管理基本要求。
 
在第五章“价格行为管理要求”中，文件对收费管理、价格促销管理做出规定。
 
李强治指出，文件明确限定了外卖平台向商户的收费项目，不得随意新设收费项目，并从公示方式、公示内容、结算明细、推广效果等方面对平台收费作了细化规定，通过提升各类费用信息披露的完整性与易理解性，防止不透明收费。
 
以李优提到的“推广服务费效果评估”为例，文件指出：“平台应为商户免费提供评估推广服务效果的工具和真实信息，包括但不限于推广点击量、推广点击率、推广引导成交订单数、推广点击转化率、推广引导成交用户数、推广引导成交金额、推广投资回报率等，引导商户科学合理开展流量推广和广告投放活动。”
 
文件也明确要求，平台价格促销成本不应变相或者直接要求商户进行分摊，并禁止平台强制或者变相强制商户开展价格促销或者干预商户促销力度。
 
文件还要求平台按照合理匹配原则，科学设定技术服务费、配送服务费和推广服务费。推动平台建立技术服务费下调机制，逐步降低基础佣金；特别是对中小微商户给予费用减免等优惠扶持。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[研究美食多年，林卫辉一直主张用食品化学原理分析烹饪技术，小到一颗荔枝或者一把桂花，他都能挖掘出美食历史与科学依据。作为美食纪录片《风味人间》的美食顾问，他被称为“行走的美食工具书”。
 
这些年，他深切感受到预制菜正越来越多地出现在餐饮行业。“有时候，我也会买预制菜包回家烹饪。”作为美食作家，他试图以“科学+文化”的双重标准，梳理预制菜行业的发展路径和现存挑战。
 
他建议餐饮企业应当和公众坦诚沟通，将背后的烹饪科学、食品技术用通俗易懂的方式讲出来，超越简单的企业生产思维。

把不同的“预制”装进了一个筐里
 
《中国新闻周刊》：你研究中餐多年，当下预制菜的发展是一种科技发展的结果吗？为什么会引发如此大的关注？
 
林卫辉：预制菜的发展，与现代食品工业、食品科学的进步密不可分，本身就是一种进步的体现。这也从一个侧面说明，传统的中餐正在通过工业化和科学化的路径寻求新的发展可能。
 
当前公众与从业者之间之所以存在观念上的巨大冲突，核心在于“预制菜”这个概念本身被混淆了，极易引起误解。事实上，任何形式的烹饪都离不开“预制”，也就是提前准备。随着生活水平的提高，我们对美食的需求出现了两极分化：一方面是追求效率优先，要求快速便捷；另一方面是闲暇时，追求极致的美味体验。但无论哪一种需求，都需要提前准备。为了效率，需要预先做好大部分工作；为了追求极致美味，有些菜品本身就需要长时间的预备烹饪。
 
现在的问题是，大家把所有这些不同层次、不同目的的“预制”装进了一个筐里，导致公众害怕工业制成品，甚至和烹饪中必需的准备工艺混为一谈。因此，讨论的基础一旦混乱，就自然会激化对立情绪。我们必须先把不同的烹饪形式，乃至背后不同的价值观理清楚，否则讨论就无法进行。
 
《中国新闻周刊》：你支持发展预制菜吗？作为消费者，你是否能接受预制菜？
 
林卫辉：我当然支持发展预制菜。任何能够满足不同消费层次需求且对社会无害的事物，都应该得到支持。预制菜的出现，是社会分工精细化、效率提升的必然结果，它能将人们从繁重的厨房劳动中解放出来，这是文明发展的方向。
 
作为消费者，我也能接受预制菜。有时为了方便，我也会买预制菜回家加热食用。其实我们家中常备的各种酱料，按照广义的概念，也属于预制菜的范畴，只是我们对它没有那么警惕而已。
 
我们真正要反对的，不是预制菜这种形式本身，而是商业上的欺诈和隐瞒。明明用的是加热料理包，却声称是“现炒”，问题的根源不在于“预制”，而在于是否诚实。
 
《中国新闻周刊》：预制菜在中餐中，目前渗透率还不高，你认为原因是什么？
 
林卫辉：我认为，目前预制菜在中餐中的渗透率其实已经很高了，尤其是在B端（餐饮企业端）。很多争议并非源于渗透率高低，而是源于中西方饮食观念的根本差异。
 
欧美消费者普遍能接受冷冻肉、冷冻蔬菜，而我们的美食观念深受农耕文明影响，对“新鲜”有着根深蒂固的追求。我们崇尚“不时不食”，喜欢新鲜的蔬菜、现宰的禽畜。这是文化中沉淀下来的价值观，必须得到尊重。不能简单地用欧美的标准来衡量中国的市场，更不能说我们不接受某种形式的食品就是“落后”的。
 
C端（消费者端）之所以表现出谨慎甚至反对的态度，核心原因在于“知情权”没有得到保障。消费者害怕的不是预制菜，而是“不知道我吃的是什么”。就拿冷冻西蓝花的讨论来说，假如有科学数据证明其营养和安全都没问题，那为什么不能明明白白地告诉消费者这是多久之前冷冻的？为什么要遮遮掩掩？这种不透明，才是导致公众恐慌和不信任的根本原因。市场行为应该是“一个愿打一个愿挨”，前提是“我买得明明白白”。

焦香和鲜活口感，极难被完美预制
 
《中国新闻周刊》：中餐很复杂，常说的八大菜系，哪些更容易被预制？哪些更难？
 
林卫辉：用菜系来划分哪个更容易或更难被预制，其实是一个很难回答的问题，甚至可能会陷入一种地域或菜系歧视的误区。因为中餐的审美是共通的，几乎所有菜系都对“锅气”“烟火气”和“风味”有很高的要求，而这些恰恰是目前预制菜难以满足的。
 
大家普遍认为川菜的调味复杂，似乎适合标准化，但一道经典的川菜同样讲究火候和“锅气”。同样，即便是一道炖菜，今天早上开始炖的和提前一个礼拜做好冷冻、今天再加热的，顾客的接受度是完全不同的。前者在公众认知里属于正常的烹饪准备，而后者才是他们警惕的“预制菜”。
 
问题的关键不在于菜系，而在于烹饪的核心审美要求。如果一道菜的核心魅力在于猛火爆炒带来的焦香和鲜活口感，那么它就极难被完美预制。如果它的风味主要来自长时间的炖煮和调味料的融合，那么它被预制的可能性就相对更高。但无论如何，预制菜在中餐的极致风味和美食体验上，目前都存在着难以逾越的缺陷。
 
《中国新闻周刊》：有一些地方菜系，例如川菜、湘菜和江西菜，都讲究猛火爆炒，是否更难被预制？
 
林卫辉：极度依赖猛火爆炒以激发“锅气”和“烟火气”的菜肴，是预制菜技术最难攻克的领域之一。不仅仅是湘菜或江西菜，几乎所有中式菜系里都有对这种烹饪方式的追求。新疆的大盘鸡，大家也希望是热气腾腾、现场烹制的，而不是简单拆袋加热后端上来的，这两种风味完全是两回事。
 
猛火爆炒的过程，不仅仅是加热，更是一个在高温下发生美拉德反应和焦糖化反应，瞬时产生复杂香气和独特口感的过程。这个过程对火候、时间、食材状态的要求都极为苛刻，差之毫厘，谬以千里。目前的预制技术，无论是在风味还原还是在口感保持上，都很难复制这种即时性和复杂性。
 
当消费者选择这类菜品时，他们期待的就是这种现场烹饪带来的独特体验。如果餐厅用预制菜来替代，即便口味上能做到几分相似，但在那种鲜活的“烟火气”上会大打折扣，这与消费者的期望值存在巨大差距，也最容易引发争议。
 
《中国新闻周刊》：有一些北方菜系中炖菜较多，对现炒要求更低，是否受预制菜影响更小？
 
林卫辉：这种看法可能是一种误解，不能简单地说北方菜系对新鲜度和现炒的要求更低。无论是南方还是北方，消费者对于美食的基本判断标准是共通的。
 
以炖菜为例，在餐厅里为了提高效率，一次性准备一个星期的鲍鱼或炖肉，从商业角度可以理解，但前提是必须让顾客有知情权。
 
实际上，影响消费者接受预制菜程度的，更多是经济发展水平和美食鉴赏能力的差异。经济越发达的地区，人们对美食体验的要求就越高，对预制菜的审视也越严格。随着大家美食鉴赏水平的普遍提高，无论南北，想要用预制菜来“蒙混过关”都会变得越来越难。
 
《中国新闻周刊》：粤菜有“不时不食”的说法，对食材的原味要求更高。预制菜对粤菜的影响是什么？
 
林卫辉：粤菜确实是受预制菜冲击和影响较大的菜系之一，因为它对食材的“生猛”和原味有着极致的追求。
 
一方面，由于用工成本和租金成本的不断攀升，许多面向大众、追求效率的餐厅，不得不更多地采用预制或半预制的出品方式。快餐式的粤菜馆，要求15分钟内上齐菜，吃完就走，这种模式不靠预制是无法实现的。
 
另一方面，那些追求极致美食体验的高端粤菜餐厅，依然会坚守传统，坚持现宰现杀，追求食材的最佳风味。它们服务的客群对价格不那么敏感，但对品质有极高的要求。
 
预制菜对粤菜的影响，不是单向的取代，而是在市场上划分出了不同的赛道。它满足了一部分人对效率的需求，同时也反向凸显了那些坚持传统烹饪技艺的餐厅的价值。最终，市场会根据不同的需求做出自己的选择。全世界的餐饮业都是如此，连锁品牌依靠规模化生存，而真正让顾客满意度高的，往往是那些用心经营的小店。

不能利用信息不对称来误导消费者
 
《中国新闻周刊》：你在《寻味》一书中重点研究了很多西方美食，预制菜在这些美食中会广泛运用吗？
 
林卫辉：当然有，西方的食品工业体系非常成熟，预制菜的应用十分广泛，但他们的优势在于“把规则讲清楚”。
 
以美国的牛肉为例，他们会明确地告诉你，牛肉在宰杀后经过14天的“湿式熟成”，风味达到最佳。对于成本更高的“干式熟成”，他们也会解释清楚，因为水分蒸发会有约三分之一的损耗，所以价格更高。当这些信息都公开透明地告知消费者后，大家就能够理解并接受。
 
我们的问题在于，我们不愿讲、不敢讲，甚至不屑于讲清楚。我们文化里根深蒂固地认为“新鲜就是最好”，所以当商家使用解冻肉时，面对顾客的询问，往往会含糊其词，甚至谎称是新鲜的，这就是欺骗。
 
中西方在预制菜应用上的核心差异，不在于技术，而在于消费文化的透明度和商业伦理。有一些食材经过适当的“预制”处理（如熟成），风味确实会更好，但这需要建立在科学解释和坦诚沟通的基础上，而不是利用信息不对称来误导消费者。

《中国新闻周刊》：在你看来，预制菜应如何提升中国消费者的价值认同？
 
林卫辉：预制菜要提升价值认同，首要任务，也是最根本的一步，就是保障消费者的知情权，必须精准、坦诚地告知消费者产品的预制程度、优势和可能的不足。可以强调预制菜在品控和口味一致性上的优势，也可以宣传其在食品安全上的保障，这些都是它的价值所在。但绝不能隐瞒，更不能欺骗，尤其是一些专家论证说预制菜比新鲜的更健康，这就是胡说八道。
 
在公众知情权得到保障之后，任何科学手段的运用才有了意义。否则，在消费者眼中，一切不透明的技术都是“科技与狠活”。企业应该开放自己的中央厨房，就像开放农场一样，展示鸡汤是怎么熬的，风味是如何萃取的，保鲜技术是如何应用的。当大家了解了背后的科学原理，自然会多一分信任。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[A new study has observed that chimpanzees regularly eat fermented fruit together, suggesting that alcohol consumption is more deeply rooted in human evolution than previously thought.

Chimpanzees regularly consume fermented fruit in the wild – ingesting significant amounts of alcohol in the process, according to a new studypublished by Science. Researchers led by Aleksey Maro from the University of California reported this month that each day the animals consume a dose equivalent to approximately one small bottle of beer for humans.
In Uganda's Kibale National Park and the Ivory Coast's Taï National Park, the researchers analyzed the 20 most popular fruit varieties, whose ripe pulp contains an average alcohol content of 0.3%.
Since a chimpanzee consumes around 4.5 kilograms of these fruits each day, the amount adds up to just under 14 grams of alcohol. Measured against the animals' body weight of around 41 kilograms, this corresponds to the consumption of more than half a liter of beer in humans.
The research suggests that regular alcohol consumption is not solely a cultural phenomenon for humans in evolutionary biology, but could have deeper roots in the behavior of our closest relatives.
These findings echo the results of another study published this spring, in which a team from the University of Exeter also observed chimpanzees consuming alcoholic fruits together in Cantanhez Forests National Park in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa.
The majority of the African breadfruit tree fruits examined had an alcohol content of up to 0.61%. However, it was unclear whether the low concentration of alcohol caused intoxication in the chimpanzees.
Using camera traps, the team recorded a total of 70 events in which chimpanzees almost always consumed alcoholic fruit together. Chimpanzees of both sexes and from different age groups participated in the party.
"Our data provide the first evidence for ethanolic food sharing and feeding by wild nonhuman great apes, and supports the idea that the use of alcohol by humans is not 'recent' but rather rooted in our deep evolutionary history," the team wrote in the journal Current Biology in April. 


Alcohol consumption not uncommon among animals
For a long time, researchers assumed that wild animals consumed ethanol, as alcohol is scientifically known, only rarely and accidentally. However, in January 2025, a study published in the journal Trends in Ecology & Evolution found that alcohol consumption among wild monkeys, birds, and insects is not uncommon after all.
"It's much more abundant in the natural world than we previously thought, and most animals that eat sugary fruits are going to be exposed to some level of ethanol,” behavioral ecologist Kimberley Hockings from the University of Exeter, who was also involved in the previous study, told the university's website, adding that the substance can be found in nearly every ecosystem. 

A precursor for human drinking?
The research team said more work was needed to understand why the fermented food was shared and whether the alcohol was consumed deliberately.
"From an ecological perspective, it is not advantageous to be inebriated as you're climbing around in the trees or surrounded by predators at night – that's a recipe for not having your genes passed on," study co-author Matthew Carrigan from the College of Central Florida told the website.
However, the observation supports the idea that the shared consumption of ethanol-containing foods is widespread and may have long played a role in human societies.
"On the cognitive side, ideas have been put forward that ethanol can trigger the endorphin and dopamine system, which leads to feelings of relaxation that could have benefits in terms of sociality," said the study's lead author Anna Bowland, from the University of Exeter. "To test that, we’d really need to know if ethanol is producing a physiological response in the wild."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The US president's latest tariff move will see the US impose 100% levies on imports of branded or patented pharmaceutical goods from October 1. What could it mean for global trade?

The news came in much the same way as previous tariff bombshells from the US president had — suddenly, via social media, and with much left unclear.
In a post on his social media site late on Thursday, Donald Trump announced  steep new tariffs on US pharmaceutical imports.
"Starting October 1st, 2025, we will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product, unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America,” he wrote on Truth Social.
So far, pharmaceutical goods have been exempt from the so-called reciprocal tariffs Trump announced back in April. That was mainly because earlier this year, the US government opened a national security probe examining the possibility of tariffs on pharma goods.
Trump has regularly threatened that pharmaceutical products would be hit with tariffs since returning to office in January so the move itself is not a major surprise, even if the timing is.

What exactly will the move mean for drugs companies?
There were two possible exemptions in Trump's announcement. He said the tariffs will not apply to so-called generic drugs, apparently meaning drugs and pharmaceuticals that use the same ingredients and are used in the same way as existing, branded drugs, originally covered by chemical patents.
However, Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore, says the distinction between branded and generic drugs is not entirely clear because there can be a "big difference." 
"There's a lot of branded, generic drugs for example. That all seems to be smashed together in Trump's announcement. At this stage, we just don't know how it will play out," she told DW.
Deborah Elms says it's still not clear what exactly will exempt a company from Trump's pharma tariffsImage: Hinrich Foundation

The other distinction Trump announced is that the tariffs will not apply to companies that produce drugs in the US or who plan to build factories there.
He wrote that "IS BUILDING" will be defined as "breaking ground" and/or "under construction." Therefore, there will be "no Tariff on these Pharmaceutical Products if construction has started," he added.
Elms says this carve-out could be significant but emphasized that because all there is to go on so far is a social media post from Trump.
If she were a pharma executive now she would be "buying a shovel and digging a hole somewhere," she suggested, in order to declare that her company had broken ground and was "preparing for a factory development."
"It's unclear what would be sufficient to avoid tariffs. They could come up with a lot of criteria that either qualifies or disqualifies. I can imagine that there will be a lot of confusion over this," said Elms.
Neil Shearing, Capital Economics' group chief economist, believes the announcement "is not quite as big a move as it appears at first sight" because the exemption for firms producing within the US is "more significant."
"Many of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies either already have some production in the US or have announced plans to build production in the near future. This would appear to make them exempt from the new tariffs," Shearing wrote in a note to clients.

Why the pharmaceutical industry in Germany is booming

Several large pharmaceutical companies have recently pledged to begin new construction in the US, such as Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, Roche Holding and GSK.
A report by US business daily Wall Street Journal earlier this month identified more than a dozen drugmakers which had pledged to spend more than $350 billion (€299 billion) collectively by the end of this decade on drugmaking and related activities within the US.


Which countries will be worst affected?
According to the United Nations Comtrade Database, the US imported around $213 billion worth of pharmaceutical products in 2024.
Data from the MIT Observatory of Economic Complexity identified Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Singapore and India as the top five exporters of pharmaceuticals to the US in July 2025. The EU accounts for around 60% of all US pharma imports.
However, it is unclear how pharmaceutical firms operating from Ireland, Germany or other EU nations will be impacted. That's because when details of the US-EU trade agreement were released in late August, it appeared that EU pharma tariffs would be limited to 15%, in line with most other tariffs in the deal.
Simon Harris, Ireland's Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, announced he would be "studying the impact of this announcement" but stressed that the August trade agreement made clear that tariffs on pharma products would be capped at 15%. "This remains the case," he said in a press release.
Ken Peng, head of Asia investment strategy at Citi Wealth, thinks the generic drugs exemption would be "good news for the likes of India and China, who mostly do not provide branded drugs to the US market."

However, Nathalie Moll, director general of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, believes the new tariffs will "increase costs, disrupt supply chains and prevent patients from getting lifesaving treatments," as she said in a statement.
Following the announcement on Thursday, shares in Asian and European pharma companies fell.
What about US consumers?
Trump has long claimed that tariffs would boost US consumers. But Deborah Elms argues that for various reasons, that will not be the case, and patients are about to "pay an awful lot more money" for pharmaceutical products.
Admitting that there could be some "long-term benefits" to homeshoring pharma production "such as securing supply," she says high US production costs mean it often makes sense for pharmaceuticals to be made elsewhere.
And so she expects "higher costs for US patients," and less pharma imports from abroad.
"In many cases, they will not reach US patients at all. So...it's also access issues. What is the benefit of this from a consumer perspective? Almost none."

The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has lifted all sanctions against Russia and Belarus.
Both countries had been under sanctions since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which involved using Belarusian territory to march on Kyiv.
At their general assembly in Seoul, the IPC first voted against a full suspension of Russia on Saturday (111-55, 11 abstentions). It was then followed by a vote against the partial suspension that had been in place (91-77, 8).
The same votes were then conducted regarding Belarus, with the partial suspension also lifted.
What did the IPC state?
"This decision means NPC Belarus and NPC Russia now regain their full rights and privileges of IPC membership, in accordance with the IPC Constitution," an IPC statement said. 
"The IPC will work with the two members involved to put practical arrangements in place for this as soon as reasonably possible," it added. 
It means Russian and Belarusian athletes could now compete under their own flags at the Milan-Cortina Winter Paralympics next year despite the ongoing war and occupation. 

However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will uphold its strict entry regulations for athletes from both countries.
They will be allowed to compete as neutrals but cannot participate in team sports or display national symbols.
How did Ukraine react?
Ukraine's Sports Minister, Matviy Bidnyi, denounced the decision, claiming that those who voted for it had betrayed "their conscience and the Olympic values."
"We call on our European partners, who will host the upcoming Winter Paralympic Games, not to allow the flag of the aggressor state to be raised over the free and democratic space while the war of aggression continues," said Bidnyi.
He added that Ukraine's "decision on whether to participate will be made collectively at a later stage".

Federations will make final decision
The Russian and Belarusian National Paralympic Committees were partially suspended after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Their athletes could only compete as neutrals after undergoing a strict vetting process at last year's Paralympic Games in Paris.
It is unclear if athletes from either country will compete in Milan-Cortina, as the final decision rests with the sports federations, which continue to impose sanctions.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[He escaped the Nazis, then joined the US military fighting Germany in World War II. He later became a legendary author, filmmaker and journalist, known for his unique interviews with international luminaries.

Georg Stefan Troller, who died on September 27 at the age of 103, lived what could simply be described as a storied life.  
An Austrian Jew who escaped the Nazis, he emigrated to the US but returned to Germany to work for the Allied Forces as an interpreter during the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. Troller would eventually spend the rest of his life in Europe, gaining prominence as a writer and reporter, and especially for his unconventional interviews of international luminaries for German television.

Fleeing the Nazis
Born on December 10, 1921 to a Jewish furrier family in Vienna, he was taunted for his Jewish heritage on the streets and by schoolmates. "You had to live with it, and it got worse under the Nazis," he once recalled.
Troller's father however ensured he got a good education and made him read all the classics; he knew the words to the Faust monologue by heart. He trained to become a bookbinder but was eventually forced to flee the Nazis at age 16, travelling via Czechoslovakia to France. In his suitcase he carried Karl Kraus' The Last Days of Mankind.
In 1941, he secured an American visa in Marseilles and was drafted into the US military service in 1943. As the Allied troops advanced through occupied France and Nazi Germany, he served as an interpreter in interrogating German prisoners of war.
"Back then, I never heard the word 'liberation,'" Troller often said in interviews, adding that freedom and democracy weren't even part of the German way of thinking. "They all admired our jeeps, the walkie-talkies. No wonder you won the war, with that equipment, they would say," he said in a 2005 TV interview with German public broadcaster WDR.

A visit to Hitler's Munich home
In 1945 in Munich, the young GI was present when the US army searched Adolf Hitler's private residence. He pocketed a few "Nazi souvenirs" and sent them to his father in the US, who was shocked.
On May 1, 1945, Troller arrived at the Dachau concentration camp, which was liberated by US troops, to interrogate SS officers who had been captured there. What he encountered made a lasting impact on him, and he could only stomach the sight of the emaciated prisoners and corpses through his camera lens.
After a short stint at Radio Munich, he worked as a reporter for Munich's Neue Zeitung. His heart, however, was in Vienna. "At that time, I walked all the streets I knew, for days, for nights, to quell my homesickness," he said. He concluded however that "you can't regain a homeland again any more than you can a childhood."
Returning to the USA, he studied drama and theater, only to travel to Paris in 1950 on a scholarship to study at the Sorbonne.
"Paris opened my eyes and taught me so much," he wrote in his 2009 memoir. "It was big city life compared to the small-town limitations you found everywhere in Germany," he said of the city that would become home.

Legendary interviews
In early 1960s Paris, Troller found his calling as a TV reporter. As a correspondent for WDR, his nine-year long Paris Journal show gave viewers delightful insights into lesser-known aspects of the City of Lights.
In 1971, he began working for Germany's ZDF TV broadcaster, which would set the course for his life. Over the next 22 years, he wrote TV history with his legendary unconventional interview show, Personenbeschreibung (Describing People). His guests included Marlon Brando, Brigitte Bardot, Alain Delon, Woody Allen, Kirk Douglas and Romy Schneider.
Initially, producers frowned upon his subjective interviewing style, as it lacked the requisite neutrality. However, his sensitive and critical approach to interviewing people struck a chord, turning him into a role model amongst other journalists.


Self-healing through journalism
To him, the camera was a protective shield. "Being a journalist was a means of self-healing," Troller once recalled. "My soul as a Jewish emigrant who had escaped the Holocaust and who had lost 19 relatives was wounded," he told the DJV Journal in a 2017 interview, adding that he calls the job he does "healing through other people." A good interview is almost like a confession, he said.
Later, he turned to TV films, documentaries, books, photo books and essays for magazines.
In 2019, he published a memoir close to his heart, entitled Liebe, Lust und Abenteuer — 97 Begegnungen meines Lebens (Love, Desire and Adventure — 97 Encounters in My Life).
Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, the indomitable personality was still going on book tours to promote his memoir. The then 98-year-old man wowed fans with readings about the story of his life with his trademark self-deprecating, Viennese humor.

New drone sightings were reported over Denmark's largest military base overnight, Danish security authorities said on Saturday.
Broadcaster DR cited the armed forces as saying unidentified drones were seen near military installations.

What do we know about the latest drone sightings?
The Danish armed forces stopped short of identifying the exact location of the drone sightings.
But the French AFP news agency and Ritzau News agency cited the police as saying the sightings were reported over the Karup air base in western Denmark, the main base of the Royal Danish Air Force.
"I can confirm that we had an incident around 8:15 pm (1815 GMT Friday) that lasted for some hours. One to two drones were observed outside and over the airbase," duty officer Simon Skelsjaer told AFP, referring to the Karup military base.
Skelsjaer said police could not comment on where the drones came from, adding that police were cooperating with the military in their investigation. 
"We didn't take them down," the officer said of the drones.
The Karup base shares its runways with the Midtjylland civilian airport. Skelsjaer said the latter was briefly closed though due to the sightings, but with little impact as no commercial flights were scheduled at that hour.

Copenhagen calls slew of drone sightings 'hybrid attacks'
The sighting is the latest in a series that has caused the Nordic country to temporarily close several airports as it dealt with what Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called "hybrid attacks."
Commenting on the drones over Copenhagen Airport earlier this week, Frederiksen described them as "the most serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure to date."
The drone incursions followed similar incidents in Poland and Romania and the violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets, which have raised tensions amid Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Thousands of Hungarians protested recently against hate speech in public discourse. But the government of Viktor Orban continues to rail against his critics — and the election campaign hasn't even got off the ground.

Hungarians were shocked last week to learn that the chief of police in the southern city of Hodmezövasarhely had taken his own life. In the preceding days, he had been the target of personal attacks in a pro-government local newspaper after permitting a rally critical of the governing Fidesz party.
People were also exhorted to take violent action at the event. It's not clear to what extent his tragic death was connected to the public hostility, but it tallies with the image of a country in which political debate is becoming more and more acrimonious.
"For a long time now, we've seen public discourse becoming increasingly aggressive," says Gabor Polyak, a professor of media law and policy at Eötvös Lorand University in Budapest. "Politicians are constantly painting someone as the enemy, dehumanizing groups, and flooding the public realm with propagandistic messages — which are funded by the taxpayer."
'The neurotoxin of propaganda'
Last weekend, Hungarians took to the streets of Budapest to protest against hate speech and incitement in public discourse. The protest was organized by the Loupe Theater Troupe, which estimated that at least 50,000 people responded to its call for a non-partisan demonstration under the slogan "Air! Stand up for free public spaces and clean public discourse." There were speeches from creative artists, including the comedian Edina Pottyondy, who warned that the Hungarian government was using "the neurotoxin of propaganda" to control public debate.
The actor Tamas Lengyel, one of Loupe's co-founders, explained that the demonstration was prompted by the government posters plastered all over the country. For more than a decade, they have incited hatred against a series of different bogeymen, from refugees to the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

"Billions of taxpayers' money are being spent on disinformation and propaganda," Lengyel told DW. "We had the idea of doing something to counter these posters."
So far, their protest activities have resulted in a petition with more than 200,000 signatures and an initiative promoting a referendum to ban hate speech in the public sphere. Lengyel and his fellow campaigners are waiting for a response from the Hungarian electoral commission.
Cult of personality, on- and off-line
Prime Minister Viktor Orban had issued yet another warning about the supposed enemies of Hungary the day before the protest, at an unofficial election campaign event just a few kilometers away. He spoke of parties, NGOs, and media organizations that were supposedly "just waiting to implement instructions from Brussels." According to Orban, they were responsible for acts of aggression and smear campaigns against "Christian and nationalist artists, media, and parties."
At the event, Orban took a selfie with the author of a far-right blog that repeatedly refers to the opposition leader Peter Magyar as a "bug." Magyar's Tisza party is currently ahead in the polls, which indicates that it stands a good chance of winning the parliamentary election next April. Consequently, the Fidesz media apparatus has its sights set on it.


Hungary's 'Don Veto'
This media apparatus also includes pro-government blogs and influencers. The prime minister has made frequent guest appearances on these outlets in recent months, as on the YouTube channel of the rapper and Orban fan Laszlo Pityinger, who calls himself "Dopeman." Pityinger has given the right-wing populist Orban the nickname "Don Veto" — an approving allusion to the fictitious mafia boss Don Vito Corleone, and Hungary's tactic of blocking European Union policies.
The media expert Gabor Polyak comments that, while the prime minister's more frequent personal appearances are a new development, "anyone who thinks that Fidesz has a lot of catching up to do in the digital realm has misjudged the reality." A study by the Budapest thinktank Political Capital reveals that between January and August 2025 around €5.6 million ($6.5 million) were spent in Hungary on political adverts on Facebook alone — and 85% of this was spent on behalf of the government.
Fidesz: Dominance of the media
Fidesz's dominance of the so-called traditional media is even more striking. The state media authority MTVA, which was brought in line by Orban long ago, received public funding of around 80 billion forints — approximately €205 million ($240 million) — in the first six months of this year. Numerous private news portals and regional newspapers are firmly in the hands of companies closely associated with Fidesz. The most important state supervisory body, the media council, is staffed by party faithful.

This is also why the NGO Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has warned that "political, economic and regulatory pressure" is being exerted on the free media. Out of 180 countries on RSF's World Press Freedom Index, Hungary is now 68th. At the start of Orban's second term in office, after he had spent four years in opposition, it was at number 23.
In order to better protect free media in countries like Hungary, the EU recently introduced a new law, the European Media Freedom Act. However, it has to rely on member states for its implementation — and the Hungarian government has already challenged the law before the European Court of Justice.
No improvement in sight
Given the balance of power and hardened positions in Hungary's media landscape, the tension in public discourse is not expected to ease.
Media analyst Gabor Polyak says the governing party bears a particular responsibility, as it has made a steadily escalating rhetoric its essential characteristic. "It's as if we've been living in a permanent election campaign for the past 10 years," he says. "The party can't function any other way."
Consequently, Polyak anticipates that the discourse will become even more acrimonious over the coming months in the run-up to the election in the spring of 2026. "It's going to be a very loud, aggressive, and brutal time," he predicts.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[In Germany, resistance against the arms race and militarization is growing. Many alliances are organizing demonstrations. What unites them, what divides them?
    Berlin's Brandenburg Gate is the backdrop for one of the many peace demonstrations that are gaining momentum in Germany Image: Fabian Sommer/dpa/picture alliance   
Major anti-war protests are planned in Germany for the next couple of weeks.
More than 10,000 people gathered in front of the world-famous Brandenburg Gate in Berlin already on September 13 under the rallying cry, "Stop the genocide in Gaza."
Russia's unlawful war against Ukraine also brought people out to the demonstration.
The most prominent speaker present was politician Sahra Wagenknecht, one of the organizers of the demonstration and the founder of the political party, the economically left-wing, politically conservative Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance.
Many well-known artists also took to the stage, including actor Dieter Hallervorden, musician Peter Maffay, and rappers Massiv and Bausa.
The very diverse group was united in its clear message to the federal government: "Provide active and meaningful support for peace negotiations in both the Middle East and Ukraine."
Demonstrators also called for all arms deliveries to war zones to be stopped.
"We are all here because we are raising our voices against the inhumane wars in this world," said Wagenknecht. "We also condemn the terrible massacre carried out by Hamas and the hostage-taking."
But none of this justifies "indiscriminately bombing, murdering, starving, and displacing two million people in the Gaza Strip, half of whom are children," said the politician.

For peace negotiations, against arms deliveries
Could this be the start of a new peace movement capable of mobilizing the masses?
German history offers many possible parallels: like in the 1980s, when the fear of nuclear war drew half a million protesters to Hofgarten Park in Bonn, in the western part of what was then still a divided Germany.
Or in 2003, when crowds just as large took to the streets of Berlin to protest against the Iraq War.
Jannis Grimm believes that there is the possibility of a new, powerful movement, but thinks it is unlikely at the moment.
Grimm is a peace and conflict researcher at the Free University of Berlin and is currently watching the emergence of many very different initiatives and alliances.
However, he said in an interview with DW, they still lack a shared goal.
"This is in contrast to what was happening during the mobilization against the Iraq War, for example, or even during the peace movement before then. At the moment, it's still relatively fragmented. But that doesn't mean it can't develop further," says Grimm.
Sahra Wagenknecht is the most prominent and most controversial figure of the movement.
In 2023, one year after the start of the war in Ukraine, she organized a rally together with women's rights activist Alice Schwarzer.
Critics accused the two of being too sympathetic to Russia or even to President Vladimir Putin.

This time around, Wagenknecht's rally is once again attracting criticism.
Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, has accused her of fueling "hatred of Israel in Germany" with her "rather populist stance."
Jan van Aken, co-chairman of the socialist Left Party, did not go that far, but he did criticize the demonstration in an interview with DW: "I believe that political work must involve as many people as possible. And for me, simply focusing on a few names is not political work."
At their demo in Berlin on September 27, Van Aken and his party hope to do things differently and, in his view, better: "We have formed an alliance with non-governmental organizations and Palestinian organizations. We have to bring everyone together: critical Israelis, Jewish Israelis."


The debate on compulsory military service mobilizes young people
Whether this approach will be successful is something the Left Party leader himself is eager to find out.
As he says himself, he is a child of the 1980s peace movement. But he does believe there is one issue that could mobilize a large number of people: compulsory military service.
"This could be a big issue because it directly affects many young people, who might take to the streets to protest against it."
If the protest spills over from the internet onto the streets, Van Aken's optimism could be justified.
There is currently an online petition circulating on the internet that was started by a young man: "No compulsory military service without a say for young people!"
As of September 26, more than 70,000 people have already signed the petition.

Germany debates return to compulsory military service

'Germany is a thoroughly pacifist country'
The Left Party sees the debate on compulsory military service as a key issue.
"This is a real delicate issue, and it will determine the future of militarism in Germany," says party leader van Aken. Over the past 40 years, he says, Germany has always managed to keep it at bay. "Germany is a thoroughly pacifist country. But at the moment, the tide is turning," he fears.
Peace and conflict researcher Jannis Grimm also believes that it is possible that protests against militarization and especially against a return to compulsory military service will grow more popular.
At present, the left-wing scene is highly fragmented. The most active groups are the Left Party and the alliance founded by Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW), which formed after splitting from the Left Party.
"This has created a situation where there is no single party that clearly overlaps with the movement on the streets," says protest researcher Grimm.
Nevertheless, resistance is clearly growing, and it could reach a high point on October 3.
As the date commemorating the reunification of Germany, it is a highly symbolic day. Large demonstrations will be held simultaneously in Berlin and Stuttgart.
Over 400 initiatives, organizations, and parties have joined the call. The slogan: "Never again ready for war! Let's stand up for peace!"

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Donald Trump advised pregnant women not to take Tylenol amid announcing a set of new autism policies. Health experts are concerned. What do the studies cited by the White House actually say?
    Tylenol, a brand of acetaminophen manufactured by Johnson & Johnson, will have a new safety label attached to it following a directive by the Trump Administration Image: Meir Chaimowitz/NurPhoto/IMAGO   
What to know
In most cases acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol) and paracetamol products are the only approved painkillers for use during pregnancy.
No high-quality scientific study exists that shows the use of these painkillers in pregnancy causes autism.
Medical practitioners have urged pregnant women to seek advice from their trusted medical practitioners when considering appropriate pain relief.
"By September we will know what has caused the autism epidemic. And we'll be able to eliminate those exposures."
So said US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in a televised meeting of US President Donald Trump's cabinet in April 2025.
Fast forward to September and Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic who has previously promoted a scientifically dismissed connection between vaccines and autism, again flanked the president to announce safety label changes to the painkiller Tylenol, or specifically, its active ingredient acetaminophen, known outside of the US as paracetamol. Acetaminophen is currently the only painkiller in the US approved for use during pregnancy.
Neither Trump nor Kennedy said the drug causes autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
Rather they along with senior health officials pointed to a handful of studies that show an association between ASD and the use of acetaminophen by mothers during pregnancy. Some of these were included in statements issued by the White House and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
It didn't stop Trump from telling America's expectant mothers at least a dozen times "don't take it," in reference to Tylenol. Scientist groups, health practitioners as well as autism advocacy and support bodies have expressed their concern at the president's comments.

What do the studies cited by the Trump Administration say?
The White House and HHS cited five research publications in their announcements of the administration's new policy directions.
Three of them were observational analyses, using data of several hundred births to explore if acetaminophen use during pregnancy led to adverse birth outcomes.
Only one of these specifically investigated ASD.
One published in the American Journal of Epidemiology in 2019 investigated acetaminophen use on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It concluded that acetaminophen use "may influence neurodevelopment."
Another published in Frontiers in Pediatrics in 2022 looked at adverse birth outcomes. It found an association may exist between acetaminophen use and low birthweight and decreased gestational age.
Both indicated that further research was required before drawing conclusions.
The sole investigation exploring autism as an outcome, published in JAMA Psychiatry in 2019, found an association with "significantly increased risk of childhood ADHD and ASD in a dose-response fashion" — where a higher dose would increase risk.
All three studies acknowledged limitations with their research that prevent definitive conclusions. DW reached out to the senior authors of the 2019 studies for comment but received declines from their affiliated institutions.

Another paper, published in BMC Environmental Health in 2025, reviewed 46 pieces of research for connections between acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental disorders. This included eight studies specific to autism. It concluded these studies were "consistent with an association between acetaminophen exposure during pregnancy and increased incidence of [neurodevelopmental disorders]."
Andrea Baccarelli, Dean of the Faculty at Harvard Chan School of Public Health (HSPH), was the senior author of this and the 2022 Frontiers study. In a statement provided to DW via HSPH, Baccarelli recommended "patients who need fever or pain reduction during pregnancy should take the lowest effective dose of acetaminophen, for the shortest possible duration, after consultation with their physician about their individual risk-benefit calculation."

Baccarelli disclosed that he consulted with the Trump Administration prior to Monday's announcement and that he was an expert witness in a case suing Johnson & Johnson, the manufacturer of Tylenol, for causing autism and ADHD in the plaintiffs' children. His deposition noted that he was paid at least $150,000 (€128,000) for more than 200 hours of work. The evidence he provided for the plaintiffs was dismissed by the judge hearing the case. The judge's opinion found Baccarelli "cherry-picked and misrepresented study results and refused to acknowledge the role of genetics."
The final study cited by the Trump Administration is a consensus statement from an international group of researchers. That statement, published in Nature Reviews Endocrinology in 2021, has been controversial. While its authors have said they took care not to say acetaminophen causes autism, others warned the statement's language could be misinterpreted. 
Many experts have also pointed to a major American-Swedish study of more than 2.4 million births, published this year in the JAMA journal, which found "acetaminophen use during pregnancy was not associated with children's autism, ADHD or intellectual disability."


Association isn't causation, and acetaminophen is a crucial pregnancy drug
While Trump — not a qualified clinician — offered his own opinion that pregnant mothers shouldn't take acetaminophen during pregnancy, his health authorities have been more cautious.
Kennedy's HHS acknowledged the "lack of clear causal evidence" on the issue. Other Trump health officials said pregnant women should consult with their doctor before taking the drug, and that clinicians would now be advised to administer "the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration when treatment is required."
This is consistent with the recommendations of the consensus statement, Baccarelli's opinion and other independent experts who have commented — and critiqued — the administration's position.
David Moebjerg Kristensen, a researcher at Roskilde University and Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark, was the senior author of the consensus statement. He told DW that while a growing body of research indicates an association between acetaminophen and autism, this is not a definitive cause-and-effect relationship.
"When it comes to autism, I would say no, we are not sure, and there's a lot of discussions going on in the field, of trying to study this and trying to understand the problems," Kristensen said.
He also said it would not be possible for a definitive clinical, randomized study to be conducted, due to ethical considerations.
"What we [the scientific community] are doing is using these observational studies, and there's a lot of confounding effects," he said. "For example, there's a genetic component there that it [autism] runs in the family. This is one of these confounding effects."
Scientists generally accept genetic causes account for around 4 in 5 cases of ASD and that the reason for spikes in case numbers is also due to widening definitions of the condition.
Ian Douglas, a Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine, UK, researches the risks and benefits of medications. He told DW the potential causes of pain during pregnancy that would prompt a woman to use the painkiller "themselves are associated with an increased risk of having a child with autism."

What now?
Experts are concerned that the conflict between Trump's personal recommendation and the stated advice from his health authorities creates a confusing set of information on the safe use of Tylenol for pregnant women, including those outside of the US.
The WHO issued a statement emphasizing "there is currently no conclusive scientific evidence confirming a possible link between autism and use of acetaminophen."
Kristensen and Douglas separately emphasized important points that are important context for the administration's announcement.
First, there is no proof that acetaminophen use by pregnant women causes autism in their child. Some studies have found an association, others have not, and most researchers in the field acknowledge further research is required.
Second, acetaminophen is a pain killer medication, currently approved and considered safe to use as indicated. For certain pain-related conditions experienced during pregnancy, it is the only approved drug available.
Third, a careful understanding of its correct use is important. For that reason, pregnant women should always consult with their health practitioners before using the medication, or any medication.
"Go to your trusted sources of medical advice and information," Douglas said. "Wherever you are, generally your local health service... will always have the best advice available, and the most up-to-date evidence, information without an agenda. I think that's the important thing."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Classical music needs fresh formats to stand out. Creative performers and organizers are charting new territory, drawing inspiration from transcultural musicians across the globe.
    People embrace classical music as performers such as de Marco take it to the streets Image: Beethovenfest Bonn   
When Juri de Marco lifts his hand and plays a note on his small pocket trumpet, people start singing and making music — in concert halls and on the street. There's no sheet music necessary; following his hand gestures allow people find their way to a shared sound that's all their own.
What de Marco makes is known as community music. "In high-classical music culture, it's all about perfection, interpretation and fidelity to the score," de Marco tells DW.
For him, community music means "making music on an equal footing," where the social interaction between people of different ages and cultures plays as important a role as the music itself.
Music-making on the rise in Germany
De Marco has tapped into the zeitgeist. According to a study by information and documentation body the Deutsches Musikinformationszentrum, more and more people in Germany are taking up music and singing on an amateur level — even without formal lessons. Over the past four years, the number has grown by 2 million, reaching 16.3 million people.
"Especially in ages up to 15 years, almost half of all children are making music," said Antje Valentin, secretary general of the German Music Council, an umbrella organization for music culture.

Children who are introduced to music early become tomorrow's concertgoers. At the moment, classical music presenters are focusing on reaching young audiences in particular. Special programs and new concert formats are being designed to spark curiosity among groups who might otherwise never set foot in a concert hall.
What tends to resonate is music that moves people, surprises them or fills them with wonder.
The Aurora Orchestra in London, for example, performs entire symphonies from memory. De Marco's pocket trumpet piques people's curiosity.
The duo Synaptic, made up of pianist Adele Thoma and singer Theresa Szorek, addresses psychological states of mind in the style of a live podcast. They combine Franz Schubert's melancholic "Winterreise" song cycle with spoken texts and new music by Bernhard Lang, creating a staged evening of song.
"We're interested in how society deals with psychological strain, the way it's also experienced by the protagonist in 'Winterreise,'" Thoma said. The program is structured like a live podcast in which the audience can follow a person's suffering with a mix of curiosity and voyeurism.
Many musicians are striving to carve out niches in the concert market with unique programs. Pianist Danae Dörken and vibraphonist Pascal Schumacher recently released a new album featuring piano and vibraphone, with the driving rhythmic patterns of composer Philip Glass.

The vibraphone's ethereal tones are especially captivating for audiences. "For me, as a classical pianist, this was a completely new world," Dörken told DW at the Beethovenfest Bonn. Luxembourger Pascal Schumacher comes from the world of jazz. "It's very unusual to work with the vibraphone," Schumacher said. "You have to reinvent yourself time and again."


What can classical music be combined with?
Valentin, of the German Music Council, sees enormous potential in concerts with innovative formats — especially when they involve blending classical music with sounds from other cultures. "I see tremendous development with transcultural ensembles," Valentin said, "especially when combined with classical music."
One example is Bernhard Schimpelsberger, who learned rhythms and melodies from a guru in India. He brings percussion instruments from around the world into classical concerts. In South Africa, he met cellist Abel Selaocoe.
"Abel plays Bach and sings African hymns over it," Schimpelsberger said. "It's incredible." They have performed together for years as a duo.

Selaocoe has written an orchestral work that combines classical and South African music, with Schimpelsberger on percussion. For the past two years, they've been performing it around the world. "We play it constantly with new orchestras everywhere," Schimpelsberger said, "and that's how I made my way into the classical world myself."

Social media and 'real-life encounters' 
De Marco has also traveled the world collecting music from different cultures for a project about Beethoven. At the Beethovenfest in Bonn, he founded a neighborhood choir. He's now working on a video for social media about the group.
Today, it's nearly impossible to gain attention without a presence on social platforms. Young British organist and influencer Anna Lapwood is a prime example: She has more than 2 million followers across her social media channels.

Of course, that requires constant attention and fresh content, the vibraphonist Schumacher said, "but the advantage is that you can reach a specific audience fairly easily and quickly."
De Marco said it was not followers or clicks that mattered most. His videos are always intended to lead to real-life encounters.
"Especially when you make music across cultures, a sense of understanding for another culture develops very quickly," he said. In today's world, that can be an important contribution to mutual acceptance.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Israel has been coming under growing international pressure after UN experts classified its actions in the Gaza Strip as genocide. UEFA could become the first sports federation to suspend Israel.

Is a suspension of Israel really on the cards?
UEFA, European football's governing body, is reportedly closing in on a suspension of Israel. According to the Associated Press and Britain's "The Times" newspaper, a majority on the UEFA Executive Committee is prepared to support a suspension. This comes after a group of experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council accused Israel of genocide through its actions in the Gaza Strip. UEFA has not yet issued an official statement but a vote could take place as early as next week.
Israel is a member of UEFA, despite not being located in Europe. This is because many members of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) boycotted Israel in the 1970s due to political tensions. To ensure regular participation in international competition, Israel was officially admitted to UEFA in 1994.
Media reports suggest that Qatar is playing a central role in the efforts to get Israel suspended. They say the emirate has been lobbying intensively for weeks trying to find a majority on the UEFA Executive Committee in favor of suspending Israel. The pressure intensified following an Israeli airstrike on Hamas targets in Doha on September 9.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has also repeatedly criticized Israel and suggested excluding its athletes. Spain and Ireland are even calling for the suspension of the European Union's association agreement with Israel, although they are all but alone in this position within the bloc.
The German Football Association (DFB) has not yet commented publicly, but it and the German government have a history of maintaining close ties with Israel. However, media reports suggest that DFB Vice President Hans-Joachim Watzke, who is a member of the UEFA Executive Committee, is among a "large majority" in favor of suspending Israel.
What would be the sporting consequences of a suspension?
A suspension would rule Israel's national team out of continuing their qualifying campaign for next summer's World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The team is currently third in Group I of European qualifying. Israel's next scheduled matches are in October in Norway and Italy.

Israeli clubs would also be excluded from international competition. Currently, just one Israeli club, Maccabi Tel Aviv, is involved in Europe – in the Europa League. However, due to the tense security situation, the team is not currently allowed to play its home games in Israel. They've been playing their Europa League games in Serbia, while the national team have been playing in Hungary.
Should UEFA exclude Israel, it would increase the pressure on other sports federations such as FIFA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). However, the IOC has so far refrained from imposing sanctions on Israel, arguing that unlike The Russian National Olympic Committee (NOC), Israel's NOC has not violated the Olympic Charter.


Who are Israel's supporters on the issue?
Israel has a powerful ally in the United States, the main host of the 2026 World Cup. US President Donald Trump strongly opposes any move to suspend Israel.
"We will absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel's national football team from the World Cup," a US State Department spokesperson said on Thursday.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who maintains close ties with Trump, is also thought to oppose the idea.
For its part, the Israeli FA has been quoted by Reuters as describing the demands to suspend Israel as "pathological anti-Semitism."
Have there been any precedents?
Russia was suspended by both FIFA and UEFA within days of launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
In 1992, Yugoslavia was excluded from the European Championship in Sweden in light of the wars that were starting to rip the country apart – and the UN sanctions that had already been imposed.

South Africa was banned from world sports for decades during the apartheid era. The sports boycott contributed to the regime's international isolation.
Following World War II, Germany was excluded from all international sports organizations for several years. However, the suspension was not explicitly due to the Holocaust perpetrated by Germany's Nazi regime. Japan and, to a lesser extent, Italy were also temporarily suspended as wartime opponents of the Allies.
No sanctions were imposed as a result of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, even though approximately 800,000 people were murdered within 100 days – with government support.
What would the geopolitical consequences be if Israel were suspended?
Excluding Israel would send a strong political signal – comparable to the boycott of Russia, but arguably with even greater moral weight because it stands accused not of launching an invasion, but of genocide.
It would also lead to diplomatic tensions, especially with the United States. Arab and Muslim countries that support the exclusion, some of which generally do not recognize the State of Israel's right to exist, would view this as a success.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Europe's top basketball competition is expanding to a new market as it tips off for a new season. DW fills you in on all you need to know.

How did the EuroLeague come about?
A quarter of a century ago, many of Europe's top basketball clubs were dissatisfied with how the then-EuroLeague was being operated and marketed. That version of the EuroLeague was operated by FIBA, basketball's global governing body and the clubs were seeking more control over revenue, schedules, and media rights.
In 2000, a group of clubs established the current EuroLeague under the umbrella of the Union of European Leagues of Basketball (ULEB). The goal was a professional, commercially successful club competition, similar to football's Champions League. The organizers were able to call it the "EuroLeague" as FIBA had failed to trademark the brand.


Who plays in the EuroLeague?
Now operated by the private company Euroleague Basketball, 13 of the 20 clubs are permanent members – remaining in the competition regardless of their success or lack thereof in their domestic leagues. Another spot is filled by the winner of the previous season's EuroCup, which is organized by the ULEB. Euroleague Basketball fills the remaining openings by issuing "wildcards," inviting clubs into the competition for a limited period of time.
The permanent members (A-license holders), including clubs like Real Madrid, Panathinaikos, Fenerbahce, CSKA Moscow, and Bayern Munich, all have a stake in the ownership of the league – giving them considerable influence over its economic and organizational direction.

However, CSKA Moscow has been suspended from play since Russia launched it's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Why is a team from the United Arab Emirates involved?
As part of its efforts to expand to new markets, the EuroLeague has given Dubai Basketball a wildcard entry for the next five years. Several factors made Dubai Basketball an attractive addition to the league; it has a modern, 17,000-capacity arena, strong financial backing, and provides the EuroLeague with access to the Arab market. Although the UAE club was only founded in 2023, it began playing in the Adriatic Basketball Association (ABA)  last season. The ABA is a strong competition in its own right, including the best teams from Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Slovenia.

How does the EuroLeague stack up against the NBA?
The EuroLeague is regarded as the world's second-best basketball league after the NBA. However, the basketball played in the EuroLeague is more tactical, team-oriented, and intense.
"Unlike the NBA, every game really counts here," Partizan coach Zeljko Obradovic has said of the EuroLeague.
"After a loss, you can't just say it didn't matter. You have to give your all in every moment until the end," the Serbian star coach added.
NBA star Luka Doncic expressed a similar sentiment after his move from Real Madrid to the Dallas Mavericks back in 2018.
"The game in Europe is much tougher than in the NBA," he said in a podcast in early 2023.
"The talent in the NBA is obviously much greater, but the space is simply different. You have a lot of open paths [in the NBA] to get to the basket and create something."
This is also because, unlike the NBA, the EuroLeague uses FIBA rules. The court is smaller, the playing time is shorter, and there is no defensive three-second rule, meaning defenders don't have to move out of the key after three seconds.

Therefore, the game in Europe is more compact. There are more set plays with blocks and passing sequences to create space, and fewer individual plays than in the NBA.
Do players move between the EuroLeague and the NBA?
In the past, a lot of top European players have struggled after moving to the NBA. Three of the best-known examples are Juan Carlos Navarro of Spain, Vassilis Spanoulis of Greece, and Serbia's Milos Teodosic.
All three are true EuroLeague legends, but none of them were able to establish themselves in the NBA, and all three wound up returning to Europe after a short time.
Now, though, more Europeans are playing in the NBA than ever before. This can be partly attributed to the high standard of play in the EuroLeague, making the step to the world's top league less of a stretch than it once was.
Conversely, many former NBA players who have moved in the opposite direction have struggled in the EuroLeague. Still, the EuroLeague does now feature many former NBA players. The high wages EuroLeague teams are now able to pay is certainly appealing – plus the fact that performing well in Europe's best basketball competition can also pave the way for a return to the NBA.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[近日，酒店的“一次性拖鞋”成为公众关注的焦点。
 
一位住客在网上反映，江苏常州一家万豪酒店存在循环使用一次性拖鞋的情况。该人士在酒店房间发现拖鞋表面不仅起球，还粘着睫毛等明显的异物。他向服务员提出异议后，酒店送过来一双新拖鞋，并表示该拖鞋要回收消毒再使用。
 





该事件迅速引发了公众热议，“五星级酒店的拖鞋竟然重复利用”？不少网友表示，刷新了认知。据媒体公开报道，后续涉事酒店相关负责人承认，出于环保考量，拖鞋在消毒清洗后确实会循环使用2—3次。
 
目前，常州市卫生监督所及新北区卫生监督所已介入调查，表示若拖鞋标注为一次性拖鞋，则严禁重复使用；如非一次性拖鞋，也须严格遵循清洗、消毒再使用的规范。
 
能省下很多成本
 
酒店提供的拖鞋，在消费者认知中通常被视为“一次性”或“一客一用”的消耗品。然而，这和酒店从业者的认知有差异。
 
根据《公共场所卫生管理条例实施细则》第十四条，公共场所提供的用品用具应保障卫生安全，可重复使用的须做到“一客一换”，并按规定清洗、消毒。细则明确，禁止重复使用一次性用品。
 
资深酒店投资人马童提到，除了快捷酒店那种几毛钱穿一次就得扔、一穿就坏的拖鞋，四、五星级酒店的报价单，已经不显示一次性拖鞋了，改名为成人拖鞋。
 
资深酒店从业者萧晓告诉《中国新闻周刊》，此次常州万豪酒店重复使用拖鞋事件，在大部分从业者看来是个普遍现象，不少酒店都是这样做的。
 
作为从业者，萧晓认为，一方面，客人穿了之后直接就丢掉，既浪费钱，又不环保；另一方面，重复利用的前提是消毒清洗，这个过程和床单被套的清洗流程是一样的，完全可以达到干净使用的标准。
 
“如果拖鞋必须丢掉的话，那床单被套，是不是也需要丢掉呢？”萧晓认为，国内不少酒店的问题在于，没有标注清楚拖鞋是否有重复利用。
 
在网上爆料的住客发现，万豪酒店提供的拖鞋说明上仅标注了“为防滑倒，请勿将拖鞋穿入浴室或者公共区域”，并未指出拖鞋是否为一次性拖鞋或者可循环利用。
 
“现在有很多酒店会明确对拖鞋做标识，声明拖鞋不可带走，如需带走请支付一定费用，这背后的原因，就是拖鞋不是一次性的，成本很高。”萧晓表示，她在国内中部省会城市经营的酒店房价不高，每晚不到两百元，但是拖鞋成本每双需要1.5元，按照每晚100间房提供两双算，一个月可能需要近万元成本。但如果重复利用几次，会节约数千元。“五星级酒店的拖鞋成本就更高了，四五元到十几元不等，能省下更多成本。”
 
“五星级酒店早就变了”
 
曾在北方某五星级酒店担任过财务人员的高楠向《中国新闻周刊》确认了上述成本，如果一个月有一万间夜[指单个住宿单位（如一间客房）被客人占用一晚的计量单位]使用了重复利用的拖鞋，洗一次省几块，一个五星级酒店一个月就能省下几万块钱。
 
常州万豪一次性拖鞋事件受到如此大的关注，还在于其“五星酒店”的高端品牌形象受损。据悉，该酒店平均每晚房价达到700元。收费不菲，却并不能提供真正的一次性拖鞋，这令很多消费者不满。
 
“五星酒店其实早就不是五星标准了”，高楠感慨，甚至比不上某些连锁大品牌的服务标准。依据高楠多年的从业经验，他指出，过往拖鞋都是严格按照集团标准，一客一换，没有所谓的“洗洗再用”一说。这两年不少五星级酒店开始走下坡路，商务接待减少，服务也相应降低标准，欠供应商货款是常态，有的酒店都发不出工资。
 
今年以来，以往高不可攀的五星级酒店，集体走下神坛，有的走出室内，在街边支起地摊，售卖单价从几元到几十元不等的早餐、小炒和盒饭，其中最受关注的是郑州永和伯爵酒店。该酒店相关负责人对媒体表示，摆摊始终是非核心业务，真正的生意都是店内办的餐饮、会务等消费场景，但是如今，这些传统业务遇到了经营困难。
 
此次拖鞋重复利用事件曝光背后的万豪酒店，在大中华区的业务正面临挑战。万豪酒店所在的万豪国际集团是四大国际酒店品牌之一，这些国际酒店在中国中高端酒店市场，拥有相当大的市场份额，是中国酒店市场的重要风向标。
 
万豪国际酒店集团日前刚刚披露了2025年第二季度业绩报告。财务数据显示，今年第二季度，万豪总收入约67.44亿美元，同比增长4.73%；净利润约7.63亿美元，同比减少1.17%。从入住率来看，万豪全球酒店的入住率为72.2%，同比减少0.3个百分点。如果从大中华区相关的业绩数据来看，多个指标处于下滑态势。就RevPAR（平均客房收益）而言，从全球各区域来看，万豪第二季度全系统酒店的RevPAR仅大中华区录得0.5%的同比下滑，第二季度大中华区酒店的日均房价为110.29美元。平均客房收益和日均房价双双下滑，意味着万豪酒店在大中华区面临着业绩压力。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[作为人类学博士，钟淑如曾在美国生活学习多年。在异国他乡，她经常要一周逛几次超市，买食材做饭，但她发现美国没有“菜市场”，无比怀念中国的买菜体验。
 
在中山大学旅游学院担任副教授后，钟淑如长期从事菜市场文化与可持续食物体系研究，在她看来，西贝事件是预制菜行业快速发展中，与公众认知产生激烈冲突的标志性事件，她称之为一次“文化应激”。
 
她将预制菜现象置于中国饮食文化变迁的宏观框架下考察，分析工业化食品与传统饮食价值观的冲突。她认为，中国消费者权益意识进入新阶段，从单纯关注食品安全转向要求制度性透明。

预制菜的生产像个“黑箱”
 
《中国新闻周刊》：预制菜的本质，是否就是食品加工工业化？这是必然的发展趋势吗？美国和日本都是预制菜大国，中国是否也一定要走这种模式？
 
钟淑如：预制菜的本质，是食品加工工业化发展的集中体现，我认为，这是一个全球性的、不可逆转的发展趋势，这可以看作社会“麦当劳化”进程的一部分，即各行各业都会追求更高的效率。近期公众对预制菜的巨大反应，正是中国传统饮食文化与快速扩张的食品工业化之间的一次剧烈碰撞，是一种文化层面的应激反应。
 
中国无疑正在走上这条道路。数据显示，预制菜市场增长趋势明显。支撑这个趋势的关键是中国餐饮业的连锁化率。2024年，我国的餐饮连锁化率提升至23％，而美国是61％，日本是53％。这意味着中国的餐饮连锁化至少还有翻倍的增长空间，而支撑这种扩张的核心，正是以预制菜和中央厨房为代表的标准化生产模式。
 
这个趋势的底层动力源于商业逻辑的变化。目前中国的餐饮市场高度分散，未被充分整合。未来发展的必然方向是行业集聚，头部企业为了降低成本、占据更大市场份额，会寻求扩张，实现规模化扩张最有效的方式就是标准化。传统中餐因其灵活性而极难标准化，预制菜和中央厨房恰好解决了这个难题。一旦菜品变得可预测、可控制，企业就能降低成本，进行规模化复制。
 
《中国新闻周刊》：在你看来，中国消费者为何更排斥预制菜？
 
钟淑如：消费者对预制菜的排斥，本质上是一个文化问题。这与我们过去对罐头等深加工食品的排斥同源。在美国或日本，罐头是日常用品，但在中国，多数消费者对罐头抱有天然的警惕，觉得它不安全、品质差。
 
这种心态的根源，在于我们文化深处对“新鲜”的执着追求。这种“新鲜的文化”体现在两个层面。一个是时间上的即时性。我们追求食材从生物到食物的转化时间尽可能短。以广东饮食文化为例，一条鱼最好是“游水活鱼”，现杀现烹，最大限度保留其本味和营养。预制菜用技术延长了食物的保质期，但实际上和“新鲜至上”的消费习惯相违背。另一个层面源于农耕文化。从传统视角来看，饮食与土地有着紧密联系。在菜市场，我们可以通过看、闻、摸等日常经验判断食材品质。预制菜的出现，切断了人与食物、与土地的亲密关联。它在生产者和消费者之间增加了无数模糊的加工、流通环节。
 
这种由生产链条拉长所导致的不透明性，极大地加剧了公众的不安全感。我们不再清楚自己吃进嘴里的到底是什么，经历了怎样的过程。这种对过程的失控感和未知感，是消费者普遍感到担忧和排斥的文化心理根源。
 
《中国新闻周刊》：也有很多人认为，预制菜食材有更严格的供应链，在食材品质、安全上更有保证，你怎么看？
 
钟淑如：这种说法需要辩证地看。“预制菜的供应链就一定更严格、品质更有保证”这种观点，在目前阶段，可能是一种过于理想化的判断。我们不能简单地将“新鲜食材”和“预制菜”进行二元对立的比较。问题的关键不在于它是“预制”还是“新鲜”，而在于整个管理体系的成熟度和透明度。
 
对于新鲜食材的流通体系，我们已建立起一套相对完善的法律法规、监管手段和技术标准。公众也积累了丰富的消费经验来做出判断，其“游戏规则”相对明确。
 
相比之下，预制菜是一个全新的行业，正处于高速增长、可能蕴含暴利的阶段。在行业发展初期，外部的监管体系、行业标准乃至从业者的职业操守能否跟上其扩张的速度，是要打一个问号的。当整个产业链条被拉长，增加了许多消费者不了解的环节，每一个新增的环节都可能成为新的风险点。
 
对于消费者而言，这个拉长的链条就像一个“黑箱”，不清楚食材来源和初始品质，不清楚加工过程中添加了什么。因此，在相关法律法规和行业规范尚未健全的情况下，断言预制菜比新鲜食材更有安全保障，我认为是值得商榷的。

“用工业标准取代人的技艺”
 
《中国新闻周刊》：你提到，预制菜的模式中，核心之一就是中央厨房模式，这对传统中餐的颠覆，体现在哪几个维度？这种颠覆，是否也有利有弊？
 
钟淑如：中央厨房模式对传统中餐的颠覆是革命性的，主要体现在三个维度：
 
一是它打破了中餐对地域性和时令性的依赖。传统中餐讲究“一方水土养一方人”，食材非常地方化。而中央厨房可以通过统一采购摆脱这种限制，让全国消费者品尝到特定地区的优质食材，理论上能极大地丰富人们的餐桌。
 
二是厨师这个职业的被“颠覆”。传统中餐的灵魂在于厨师，培养一位好师傅非常不易。但中央厨房出现后，口味在生产线上被标准化，餐厅不再需要有经验的大师傅，转而需要的是“操作员”。现在的连锁餐厅后厨人员，不少人没有烹饪经验，只需培训几天，按照步骤重复操作即可。
 
三是对口味和消费选择的统一化与简单化。中央厨房模式下，菜单固定，菜品标准。消费者无法进行任何个性化的定制。然而，在传统小馆，消费者可以跟老板商量调整菜品做法，这种互动在连锁餐厅里是不可能实现的。我们的口味看似选择丰富，实则被精心设计和限定，这使得中餐失去了原有的灵活性和创造力。
 
中央厨房模式之所以受到争议，是因为它所代表的工业化逻辑，与我们对中餐是“一门手艺”的传统认知，产生了根本性的冲突。
 
《中国新闻周刊》：传统中餐强调现炒，除了“锅气”之外，还有哪些价值和优势？
 
钟淑如：传统中餐现炒的价值，远不止于“锅气”。现炒真正的核心价值在于它的“表现力”——厨师的技艺、心意和创造力的展现。一道好的中餐菜品，是厨师运用其对食材、火候、味道的综合理解，进行的一次即兴创作，它是有灵魂的。这种由人的技艺所带来的丰富性、变化性和情感温度，是标准化的料理包永远无法给予的。
 
《中国新闻周刊》：预制化是否必然导致“锅气”消失？是否会威胁到如潮州菜、淮扬菜等地方菜系的传统技艺？
 
钟淑如：是的，威胁非常大。中餐的精髓在于其“地方性”。你在成都吃到的川菜和在广州吃到的，味道截然不同。因为正宗的地方菜，是当地水土、食材和人文习惯的结晶。预制菜的工业逻辑，则与这种地方性背道而驰。它的目标是大众市场，为了照顾最广泛的口味，它必须抹平棱角，寻求一个“最大公约数”的味道。它生产的菜品，通常“不难吃”，但绝不会有惊喜和鲜明的地域标签。
 
这种“平均主义”的口味塑造，对于像潮州菜、淮扬菜这样极度讲究食材本味、刀工精细、火候微妙的菜系来说，是毁灭性的打击。这些菜系的灵魂在于“因时制宜、因材施艺”的烹饪智慧，依赖厨师的即时判断和精妙处理，是标准化料理包无法复制的。
 
预制菜的野心在于，它试图通过潜移默化的方式，重新培养和驯化大众的味蕾。当越来越多的人习惯了这种标准化的味道，他们对传统地方菜系那种复杂、极致风味的欣赏能力，可能会逐渐退化。这不仅是传统技艺的失传，更是一种饮食审美能力的丧失。

“最终会共存但高度分化”
 
《中国新闻周刊》：你认为公众的担忧源于何处？餐饮企业应如何重建信任？
 
钟淑如：公众的担忧，核心源于知情权和定价权。大家普遍感到，自己被剥夺了“知道吃的是什么”的权利，并为工业化食品支付了过高的价格，有很强烈的“被欺骗感”。
 
要重建信任，餐饮企业需要做的是系统性的努力。像“后厨直播”这种措施是否有效，关键在于“直播”什么。如果在直播中展示如何拆开料理包，只会起到反效果。真正有效的信任重建，应该回归到餐饮的本质。
 
一是餐厅的东西必须好吃，这是最朴素，也是最直接的评判标准；二是企业需要提供真正的透明度，包括食材的可溯源性，如果你能清楚地告诉消费者食材来源，并且有据可查，这比任何宣传都更有力；三是真正的明厨亮灶，展示真实的烹饪过程，依然是有效的，前提是后厨确实在“烹饪”而非“复热”。
 
归根结底，重建信任是一条漫长的路，需要从业者拿出诚意，尊重消费者的知情权，并提供与价格相匹配的价值。
 
《中国新闻周刊》：预制菜供应链越长，“科技与狠活”介入越大。你认为预制菜行业应该如何进一步建立标准？
 
钟淑如：供应链的延长确实会放大风险。当前行业主要存在四个具体的风险点。一是食材品质的模糊化。经过深度加工和重油重盐的调味，食材原本的质地和风味被掩盖，不良商家可能使用品质较差的原料。二是烹饪过程中的健康隐患。为了延长保质期和统一风味，预制菜肴往往会采用重油、重盐、重糖的烹饪方式。三是运输和储存中的安全问题。预制菜对冷链要求极高，一旦出现温度控制不当、反复解冻的情况，就容易滋生细菌。四是食品添加剂的滥用。虽然合规的添加剂是安全的，但无法保证生产过程中是否存在过量使用的情况。
 
关于如何建立标准，我无法提供技术性细节，这需要多领域专家共同制定。但从宏观监管思路上讲，标准和监管应该精准对准这些风险点，建立一个覆盖“全链路”的管理体系。也就是说，从食材采购、加工烹饪，到添加剂使用，再到包装、运输、仓储和最终销售环节，每一个关键节点都应该有明确、可执行、可追溯的标准。
 
《中国新闻周刊》：预制菜会取代现制菜，还是两者形成互补共存的格局？
 
钟淑如：目前来看，预制菜与现制菜的关系，与其说是“互补”，不如说“取代”的成分更多。随着连锁餐饮凭借资本和效率优势不断扩张，它们挤压的是传统小餐馆的生存空间，实际上是在用工业化的味觉标准，取代多样化的地方味觉传统。
 
我对此有一个深层次的担忧。当年轻一代从小成长在标准化连锁餐厅的环境中，他们对于“好吃”的定义会发生根本性的改变，可能会逐渐失去对食材本味、对精妙烹饪技艺的欣赏能力。
 
当然，我认为预制菜不会彻底取代现制菜，最终会形成一个共存但高度分化的市场格局。一方面，预制菜凭借其效率和成本优势，主导大众餐饮市场，满足人们日常的功能性就餐需求，成为生活中的“基础设施”；另一方面，坚持传统、讲究技艺的现制菜，可能会逐渐退守到“精品餐饮”或“特色餐饮”的细分市场，变得更像一种文化体验或社交方式，而非日常果腹的选择。

        <updated>2025-09-26T04:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[In early August, one day before releasing GPT-5, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted an image of the Death Star on social media. It was just the latest declaration by Altman that his new AI model would change the world forever. “We have discovered, invented, whatever you want to call it, something extraordinary that is going to reshape the course of human history,” Altman said in a July interview. He compared his company’s research to the Manhattan Project and said that he felt “useless” compared with OpenAI’s newest invention. Altman, in other words, suggested that GPT-5 would bring society closer to what computer scientists call artificial general intelligence: an AI system that can match or exceed human cognition, including the ability to learn new things.
For years, creating AGI has been the holy grail of many leading AI researchers. Altman and other top technologists, including Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, and the computer science professors Yoshua Bengio and Stuart Russell, have been dreaming of constructing superintelligent systems for decades—as well as fearing them. And recently, many of these voices have declared that the day of reckoning is near, telling government officials that whichever country invents AGI first will gain enormous geopolitical advantages. Days before U.S. President Donald Trump’s second inauguration, for example, Altman told Trump that AGI would be achieved within his term—and that Washington needed to prepare.
These declarations have clearly had an effect. Over the last two years, Democratic and Republican politicians alike have been discussing AGI more frequently and exploring policies that could unleash its potential or limit its harms. It is easy to see why. AI is already at the heart of an array of emerging technologies, including robotics, biotechnology, and quantum computing. It is also a central element of U.S.-Chinese competition. AGI could theoretically unlock more (and more impressive) scientific advancements, including the ability to stop others from making similar breakthroughs. In this view, if the United States makes it first, American economic growth might skyrocket and the country could attain an unassailable military advantage.
There is no doubt that AI is a very powerful invention. But when it comes to AGI, the hype has grown out of proportion. Given the limitations of existing systems, it is unlikely that superintelligence is actually imminent, even though AI systems continue to improve. Some prominent computer scientists, such as Andrew Ng, have questioned whether artificial general intelligence will ever be created. For now, and possibly forever, advances in AI are more likely to be iterative, like other general-purpose technologies.
The United States should therefore treat the AI race with China like a marathon, not a sprint. This is especially important given the centrality of AI to Washington’s competition with Beijing. Today, both the country’s new tech firms, like DeepSeek, and existing powerhouses, like Huawei, are increasingly keeping pace with their American counterparts. By emphasizing steady advancements and economic integration, China may now even be ahead of the United States in terms of adopting and using robotics. To win the AI race, Washington thus needs to emphasize practical investments in the development and rapid adoption of AI. It cannot distort U.S. policy by dashing for something that might not exist.
WILDEST DREAMS
In Washington, AGI is a hot topic. In a September 2024 hearing on AI oversight, Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal declared that AGI is “here and now—one to three years has been the latest prediction.” In July, South Dakota Senator Mike Rounds introduced a bill requiring the Pentagon to establish an AGI steering committee. The bipartisan U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission’s 2024 report argued that AGI demanded a Manhattan Project–level effort to ensure the United States achieved it first. Some officials even believe AGI is about to jeopardize human existence. In June 2025, for instance, Representative Jill Tokuda of Hawaii said that “artificial superintelligence, ASI, is one of the largest existential threats that we face.”


The fixation on AGI goes beyond rhetoric. Former Biden administration officials issued executive orders that regulated AI in part based on concerns that AGI is on the horizon. Trump’s AI Action Plan, released in July, may avoid explicit mentions of AGI. But it emphasizes frontier AI, infrastructure expansions, and an innovation-centric race for technological dominance. It would, in the words of Time magazine, fulfill “many of the greatest policy wishes of the top AI companies—which are all now more certain than ever that AGI is around the corner.”
The argument for dashing toward AGI is simple. An AGI system, the thinking goes, might be able to self-improve simultaneously along multiple dimensions. In doing so, it could quickly surpass what humans are capable of and solve problems that have vexed society for millennia. The company and country that reach that point first will thus not only achieve enormous financial returns, scientific breakthroughs, and military advancements but also lock out competitors by monopolizing the benefits in ways that restrict the developments of others and that establish the rules of the game. The AI race, then, is really a race to a predetermined, AGI finish line in which the winner not only bursts triumphantly through the ribbon but picks up every trophy and goes home, leaving nothing for even the second- and third-place competitors.

 It is unlikely that superintelligence is actually imminent.
Yet there is reason to be skeptical of this framing. For starters, AI researchers can’t even agree on how to define AGI and its capabilities; in other words, no one agrees on where the finish line is. That makes any policy built around achieving it inherently dubious. Instead of a singular creation, AI is more of a broad category of technologies, with many different types of innovations. That means progress is likely to be a complex and ever-changing wave rather than a straight-line trip.
This is evident in the technology’s most recent developments. Today’s models are making strides in usability. The most advanced large language models, however, still face many of the same challenges they faced in 2022, including shallow reasoning, brittle generalization, a lack of long-term memory, and a lack of genuine metacognition or continual learning—as well, of course, as hallucinations. Since its release, for instance, GPT-5 has looked more like a normal advancement than a transformative breakthrough. As a result, some of AGI’s biggest proponents have started tempering their enthusiasm. At the start of the summer, the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said that AI wasn’t hyped enough; now, he argues that people have become too obsessed with “superintelligent” systems. Similarly, in August, Altman declared that AGI is “not a useful concept.” In some ways, when it comes to AGI, the computer science world may still be where it was in 2002, when the then director of MIT’s AI lab joked that the true definition of AI was “almost implemented.”
Even if some AI models do prove transformative, their effects will be mediated by adoption and diffusion processes—as happens with almost every invention. Consider, for example, electricity. It has generated untold value and utterly transformed the global economy, but it became useful thanks to the thousands of scientists, engineers, inventors, and companies who worked on it over the course of decades. Benjamin Franklin proved lightning was electricity in 1752, Alessandro Volta invented the first battery in 1799, and Nikola Tesla developed alternating current in the late 1880s. Even then, it took many more years before most homes had power outlets. All these innovations were critical to reaching that eventual endpoint, and no one actor captured the global market for electricity or effectively prevented others from continuing to innovate.


The modern combustion engine provides another case in point. It was invented in 1876 by the German engineer Nicholas Otto, but was advanced and improved on over the course of several decades before automobiles went mainstream. Companies around the world ultimately achieved massive gains from automobiles, not just German ones (although the German auto industry is, of course, very successful). Perhaps the most prominent early leader, the Ford Motor Company, was American, and it first dominated the car market thanks to its innovations in production, not engines.
INNOVATION AND ADAPTATION
If AI competition is more likely to span a generation than just a few more years, American officials need to think more about how the country can quickly adopt AI advances and less about how to summon AI’s speculative potential. This is closer to what Beijing does. Although the United States and China are very different and the latter’s approach has its limits, China is moving faster at scaling robots in society, and its AI Plus Initiative emphasizes achieving widespread industry-specific adoption by 2027. The government wants AI to essentially become a part of the country’s infrastructure by 2030. China is also investing in AGI, but Beijing’s emphasis is clearly on quickly scaling, integrating, and applying current and near-term AI capabilities.
To avoid falling behind in AI adoption within the bureaucracy, the United States should launch a large-scale AI literacy initiative across the government. Public employees of all kinds need to know how to use both general AI systems and ones tailored to their jobs. American officials should offer expanded access to AI training both for their particular roles and for general use, including training on issues like automation bias (in which people overestimate the accuracy of AI systems). To do so, Washington can take advantage of the fact that major American companies, including OpenAI and Anthropic, are willing to give public employees and agencies more exposure and access to their technologies, allowing the state, at least for now, to use their large language models virtually for free.
The United States must also modernize its infrastructure and data practices, including within the national security apparatus. Advanced AI models require sophisticated hardware, adequate computing power, and state-of-the-art knowledge management systems to operate effectively. And today, Washington is behind on each. The government has started to make some progress on upgrading its systems, but decades of siloing and bureaucratic processes have created entrenched lags that are hindering innovation. To achieve AI adoption at scale, Washington will likely need to invest billions of dollars in procurement over the next few years, especially for the Pentagon.

 Racing toward a myth is not sound policy.
Done right, AI could revolutionize the government’s efficiency. Even if it helps only in mundane areas, such as energy load optimization, cybersecurity and IT, predictive maintenance, logistics, supply chain management, and acquisition paperwork, it will allow larger bureaucracies to overcome or eliminate regulatory hurdles. That could, in turn, fuel more private-sector adoption. Right now, private sector pilot projects with frontier AI sometimes fail to successfully transition from prototype to full capability, often because of integration challenges or misalignment between a proposed AI solution and the problem it targets. By some estimates, more than 80 percent of AI projects fail to deliver results. Industry surveys report that 88 percent of pilots never reach production. The IT company Gartner has projected that 40 percent of “agentic AI” deployments—autonomous AI systems capable of planning and executing multistep tasks with minimal or no human oversight—will be scrapped by 2027. By placing greater value on and demonstrating how AI can be integrated into large, complex bureaucracies, the government can help forge a pathway for private companies, lowering their perceived risks. By adopting AI, Washington can also create demand signal for scalable, near-term AI applications.
But protecting American AI leadership will require the government to do more than just help itself and the private sector. The United States will also need to invest in universities and researchers who can make invaluable technical breakthroughs in AI safety, efficiency, and effectiveness, but lack the capacities of big firms. The Trump administration must therefore follow through on its plan to expand support for the National AI Research Resource, a nascent, government-provided consortium of AI infrastructure that would provide researchers, educators, and students with the specialized tools they need for advanced AI work.
None of these steps means U.S. officials should abandon thinking about AGI. In fact, some of the best policies for ensuring AI leadership today will also hasten the arrival of more advanced systems. Any policy that supports AI research and development, such as the immense investment in technology mandated by the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, will lead to more sophisticated algorithms. So will continued investment in the country’s power infrastructure, which helps the energy-intensive AI industry grow and function.
But Washington must ensure that the pursuit of AGI does not come at the expense of near-term adoption. Racing toward a myth is not sound policy. Instead, the country’s primary goal must be rapidly scaling practical AI applications—improvements that meet government needs and deliver real efficiencies today and tomorrow. Otherwise, the United States could keep producing the world’s fanciest models. It could lead in algorithm creation. But it will still fall behind countries that make better use of AI innovations.]]></content>

        <link href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/pentagons-missing-china-strategy"/>
        <updated>2025-09-26T04:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[In the mid-2010s, Pentagon officials in the United States were alarmed by the military progress China and Russia were making. Both countries were investing in cyber, space, and electronic warfare capabilities as well as precision-guided munitions and long-range, ground-based weapons. U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work was particularly concerned about China, which he determined was trying to achieve parity with the United States in military technology. China had developed the DF-21D, an antiship ballistic missile with a range of nearly 1,000 miles dubbed the “carrier killer,” which posed a threat to U.S. ships—including aircraft carriers—in the Pacific. It was time, Work and others in the Pentagon concluded, to imagine what a war in the Pacific might look like and consider how the United States would win it.
Inspired by the so-called offset strategies that the United States developed to counter the Soviets during the Cold War, Work proposed a “third offset” to counter China’s advantages in the Pacific. The U.S. military started drafting new warfighting concepts, such as the navy’s Distributed Maritime Operations, which involved spreading out forces over a large area and developing long-range weapons. The Pentagon also started identifying what weapons, systems, and equipment it would need to buy, prompting new investments in space capabilities, advanced sensors, and a variety of promising technologies, such as advanced sea mines. The third offset, as Work described it, was a “combination of technology, operational concepts, and organizational constructs—different ways of organizing our forces—to maintain our ability to project combat power into any area at the time and place of our own choosing.”
But in many ways, Work’s third offset was a decade ahead of its time. At the time, the United States was still the preeminent superpower. Neither China nor Russia possessed a significant military advantage over the United States—there was not much, in other words, for the U.S. military to offset. Although Work’s call to action inspired various initiatives, it never fully took shape with coherence or urgency.
Today, the situation is gravely different. China’s defense industrial base is on a wartime footing, producing hardware and software at what Admiral Samuel Paparo, the head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, calls “an alarming pace.” Its military and commercial shipbuilding capacity is roughly 230 times larger than that of the United States, and its long-range missile capabilities have mushroomed over the past two decades. This means that China poses a serious threat to the U.S. military in the two concentric island chains on Beijing’s maritime flank, the second of which extends south from Japan to Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau. If, for example, the current tensions over Taiwan were to break out into a full-scale war, U.S. forces from Japan to Guam would be vulnerable to Chinese strikes before they even got to the fight.
Like the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War, however, China has vulnerabilities that can be exploited. It is time for the United States to develop, in earnest, a new offset strategy. Although Beijing has dominated Washington’s agenda in recent years, the Pentagon has not yet developed a modern-day equivalent of the so-called AirLand Battle concept that U.S. leaders established in the 1970s to defeat the Soviet Union in central Europe. Thus far, much of the focus has been on emerging technologies, such as autonomous systems and artificial intelligence.


Technology is important, but it has never been sufficient to win wars. As Andrew Marshall, the longtime head of the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment, argued, “Technology makes possible the revolution, but the revolution itself takes place only when new concepts of operation develop.” The United States, in other words, needs to develop a joint concept of operation—a plan to use forces to conduct specific military operations—and it needs to follow through by making the necessary investments and acquisitions to offset Beijing’s numerical and industrial advantages. If it does not, the United States risks losing a war with China.
NEW LOOK
The United States has done this before. During the Cold War, the United States succeeded in several major efforts to offset Soviet advantages. The first was the Eisenhower administration’s New Look, which involved countering the Red Army’s significant numerical advantage in central Europe. In the 1950s, the Soviets had nearly three times the number of ground forces in Europe as the United States and its allies did, and it was building a formidable industrial base.
But instead of deploying and sustaining a large standing army in Europe, which might have crippled the U.S. economy, President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his administration developed New Look: the plan to build an overwhelming nuclear advantage and plan, in the event of a war, to use tactical nuclear weapons against Red Army troops, including inside West Germany. As described in the administration’s policy paper NSC 162/2, which Eisenhower approved in October 1953, the United States would develop the capability to inflict “massive retaliatory damage by offensive striking power.” The goal was to strengthen deterrence and persuade the Soviet Union not to start a war, but for the United States to nevertheless be prepared in case of a conflict.
New Look was backed up by new acquisitions in nuclear weapons and long-range bombers. In 1956, for example, Eisenhower pushed through Congress a request to ramp up B-52 production from 17 to 20 aircraft per month, along with additional funding for missile research and expansion of B-52 facilities. The result was overwhelmingly successful: the Soviets were deterred in central Europe, and by the 1960s, the United States held a commanding lead over the Soviet Union in missiles—including nuclear missiles.

 China’s defense industrial base is on a wartime footing.
A decade later, however, the United States was in danger of losing that edge in deterrence thanks to U.S. defense cuts and Soviet advancements. The Soviets had reached nuclear parity with the United States and had a three-to-one advantage in conventional capabilities in central Europe. To respond, U.S. President Jimmy Carter’s secretary of defense, Harold Brown, and Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering William Perry led a second offset.
Brown and Perry realized that they could defeat Soviet forces attempting to invade Western Europe if they could effectively strike the rear-echelon forces, or those feeding the frontlines, with precision. The so-called second offset, which included the concept of AirLand Battle, thus led to a focus on acquiring stealth and precision weapons, such as the F-117 Nighthawk aircraft, the laser-guided Copperhead antitank projectile, and various precision-guided bombs and missiles.


The Reagan administration continued these efforts into the 1980s as Moscow watched with alarm. In 1981, Soviet General Nikolai Ogarkov and other Soviet leaders conducted a massive exercise, called Zapad-81, to see how Soviet forces would fare against the new U.S. strategy. Afterward, Minister of Defense Dmitri Ustinov said the military balance between NATO and the Warsaw Pact was “at the moment not in our favor.”
THE THIRD OFFSET
Developing a successful offset strategy has two distinct phases: first, identifying an operational concept, or specific plan, to defeat the adversary; second, identifying, developing, and deploying the weapons, systems, and equipment that the operational concept calls for. Doing these steps in order sends a clear message and strengthens deterrence.
If the United States’ goal is to prevent a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, it is useful to imagine how that would play out. A war so close to the Chinese mainland would be a major challenge for the U.S. military because of China’s ability to deploy a large number of missiles, aircraft, ships, and other capabilities to the fight. It would also be difficult for China’s military, the People’s Liberation Army, which would have to move massive amounts of troops, weapons, and materiel through an amphibious landing, air assault, airborne landings, or a combination of these means. The first troops to land would have to seize a foothold in Taiwanese territory before allowing follow-on PLA forces to flow into Taiwan. The United States would need to act within hours or days to prevent a territorial fait accompli, and it would need to be able to rapidly strike at the heart of the PLA’s invasion force, dislodging it from any territory it had gained.
Consequently, the United States needs to strengthen and expand its force posture in the region to respond immediately to a Chinese invasion. The United States can, for example, deploy additional bombers to bases in Australia, harden shelters for aircraft at such locations as Kadena Air Base in Japan, establish active defenses for missiles in Guam, and stockpile fuel, spare parts, munitions, and other materiel across the Indo-Pacific that can be used for a fight.

 There is a lot the United States will not need for a potential conflict with China.
For the United States to carry out rapid strikes on Chinese forces, it will have to be able to see all high-value PLA targets on the battlefield at any time, hit targets with mass and precision, and destroy any target that can be hit. Such targets include PLA amphibious assault ships, landing craft, air assault helicopters, and planes carrying PLA soldiers, weapons systems, and air defenses, as well as the operational command-and-control centers supporting the invasion force. The United States would need to generate combat power that can operate both inside and outside the reach of China’s strike systems. As Admiral Paparo has remarked, “I want to turn the Taiwan Strait into an unmanned hellscape using a number of classified capabilities so I can make their lives utterly miserable for a month, which buys me the time for the rest of everything.”
This would require a major increase in the U.S. inventory of precision-guided long-range missiles that can strike PLA vessels and aircraft. Long-range antiship missiles are effective against PLA targets, but they are expensive at over $3 million per missile, and the United States does not have enough of them. The United States needs to ramp up the research, development, and production of long-range missiles—especially antiship missiles to strike PLA surface vessels—that are cheaper. The United States will also need a lot more relatively cheap unmanned aircraft systems, or drones, particularly drones that do not need runways to launch.
Manned aircraft, however, are still important, especially bombers and stealthy fifth- and sixth-generation fighters. The range and strike capabilities of stealth bombers such as the B-21 Raider presents China with a particularly daunting challenge. They can be based beyond the range of Chinese ballistic missiles, and they can carry substantial conventional and nuclear bombs to thin Chinese forces. Some fifth- and sixth-generation stealth aircraft such as the F-35 are also helpful because their speed, sensor packages, and strike capabilities allow them to operate inside the first and second island chains for air-to-air and air-to-ground missions, as well as to collect and share battlefield data across ground, air, and maritime forces.
Finally, the United States needs a mix of large nuclear-powered attack submarines and cheap underwater drones. The PLA is relatively weak in the undersea domain and struggles to detect, identify, and track U.S. submarines. In multiple iterations of war games by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, for example, U.S. submarines wreak havoc on Chinese ships, including large amphibious vessels, escorts, and logistics vessels. The United States must lean into this undersea advantage and prioritize maintaining it.
FOCUS THE FIGHT
Other capabilities are also important, such as software that leverages next-generation artificial intelligence, which allows the U.S. military to share massive amounts of data quickly between forces. But the future of warfare is not just about unmanned systems, artificial intelligence, and other technologies. U.S. military capabilities need to be grounded in a viable operational strategy. Inventing technologies or being the first country to use a technology has never guaranteed an advantage on the battlefield. British engineers at William Foster & Co. developed and produced the tank. But it was German military officers, such as Heinz Guderian, that used the tank to devastating effect during blitzkrieg operations in World War II.


There is also a lot the United States will not need for a potential conflict with China, such as large numbers of surface ships and aircraft carriers, which are vulnerable and highly exposed in a war. The United States is also still investing in land systems, such as tanks, that will not be necessary for this fight. An offset that focuses on China, of course, does not exclude preparing for contingencies elsewhere, such as against Russia in eastern Europe, Iran in the Middle East, or North Korea on the Korean Peninsula. But it does mean that the United States needs to prioritize defeating and deterring China, much as the United States focused on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The Russian economy is in trouble. Growth has stalled, energy revenues have plunged, and the budget deficit is growing. If the EU and US step up sanctions, things could get more serious still.

The pressures of the war in Ukraine are starting to bite for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his policymakers in the Kremlin, with Moscow planning tax hikes and spending cuts to deal with its growing budget deficit.
The draft budget for 2026 is expected to be submitted to parliament on September 29. Only minor changes are likely from that point, with Putin having agreed to the main details by then.
On Wednesday (September 25), the government announced plans to raise value added tax to 22% from 20% in a bid to curb the deficit, reneging on a pledge Putin previously made not to raise taxes before 2030.
There is also growing expectation that nondefense spending, including some social spending, will be cut to deal with the mounting pressures caused, largely, by plunging oil revenues.
Russia's budget deficit has grown to around 4.2 trillion rubles ($50 billion, €42.7 billion). That's around 1.9% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) — almost four times the original target of 0.5% for 2025. The finance ministry expects the deficit to reach 5.7 trillion rubles by the end of the year.
However, Elina Ribakova, an expert on the Russian economy with the Kyiv School of Economics, expects Moscow to continue what she says is an established pattern of maintaining high military spending by making cuts elsewhere.
"The consequences are the same as we have seen since 2014," she told DW. "That is: everything else gets cut, the military spending expands. So, education, health care, social spending, environmental protection, all of that gets cut severely."

Chris Weafer, a Moscow-based financial analyst with the consulting firm Macro-Advisory, told DW that budget cuts have been in the offing since Putin signaled them last December.
"We've had a deliberate slowdown in government spending in nonessential areas, which essentially means nonessential military and maybe nonessential social areas," he said.
Flashing red
Russia's economy has been flashing red for a while, a fact seized upon by US President Donald Trump in his social media post of September 24, which expressed strong support for Ukraine.
"Putin and Russia are in big economic trouble and this is the time for Ukraine to act," he wrote on Truth Social.
He also referenced Russia's ongoing fuel crisis. Ukraine's successful drone attacks on Russian energy infrastructure such as refineries and export terminals have led to shortages of multiple fuel grades, rising prices, and long queues.

A major cause of the overall economic difficulty is the ongoing fall in oil and gas revenues. Soaring oil prices and enthusiastic new buyers in China and India meant Russian energy revenues soared in 2022 and stayed strong in 2023, despite Western sanctions and the EU reducing its dependence.
However, a falling oil price, a stronger ruble, the attacks on refineries and the continued impact of sanctions have all chipped away at the Kremlin's key revenue source. State oil and gas revenues are set to fall by around 23% year-on-year in September, pointing to a darkened economic outlook.

In July, GDP grew by 0.4% year-on-year, indicating a significant cooling. Official forecasts predict growth of 1% this year, well down from 2.5% forecast. This time last year, soaring inflation pointed to an overheating economy, pumped up by massive budget increases on defense spending.
Defense spending has more than quadrupled since 2021, and totalled around 16 trillion roubles in the year to June 2025.
Chris Weafer says the official narrative is that what is happening is a "managed cooling," with the central bank having raised interest rates to curb inflation and reduce soaring consumer spending — a move which has largely worked.


Budget cuts
However, he says the budget is "unsustainably high" and that if it is not significantly pulled back in the next few years — including military spending — it threatens to "destroy this whole narrative of how stable Russia is, and how the economy is fine, and people's lives are unaffected, and everything is grand."
"You would destroy the economy," said Weafer, who believes Putin and the Kremlin are increasingly open to the idea of a peace deal being struck soon because of the growing economic pressure.
"Domestic budget pressure relative to the need to maintain stability is a significant factor, and one that adds to the weight of feeling this has got to end sooner than later," he said.

Ribakova is not as optimistic. "When they went into the 2022 invasion, they were conscious of the economic costs. They calculated them, and at the political level, they decided it's acceptable," she said.

Secondary sanctions
Given the strains faced by the Russian economy, pressure is growing on the EU and US to significantly strengthen existing sanctions in pursuit of a successful peace negotiation.
Trump has recently called on Europe to do more to completely end its purchases of Russian gas, mostly via liquefied natural gas (LNG). The bloc still purchases Russian oil too, via refined products.
The US has also mulled placing secondary sanctions on countries like India and China, which buy large quantities of Russian oil. Such a move could seriously add to Moscow's economic challenges.

Ribakova thinks now is the time to ramp up pressure on Moscow with more sanctions, as it is clear the economy is as vulnerable as it has been for quite a while.
However, she points to the fact that the heavily sanctioned regimes in Venezuela, North Korea, and Iran remain in power despite economic calamity as evidence that sanctions alone will not save Ukraine.
"Sanctions can fix part of the problems, but they cannot solve all," Ribakova said.
However, Chris Weafer thinks secondary sanctions in particular could force Moscow quickly to the table.
If the US were to put secondary sanctions on the buyers of Russian oil, then that would be very important, he argues.
"If you were to take, say, another 20-30% hit to oil export revenues, then that would tip the budget into unsustainable territory and could force massive changes to the domestic dynamics."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Once a cover for closeted Hollywood stars and persecuted LGBTQ+ people, lavender marriages got a Gen Z reboot, offering protection, partnership and a new take on marriage in the digital age.
    The 2022 Hindi film 'Badhai Do' explored the theme of lavender weddings Image: Zee Studios/Everett Collection/picture alliance   
Over the past year, a curious trend has been making the rounds on TikTok: Young (and mainly Western) people are proposing marriage to like-minded individuals seeking companionship and stability as well as shared financial burdens and benefits.
Love and/or sex? Not necessary. 
The term "lavender marriage" resurfaced from obscurity, sparking conversations about the origins of such marriages of convenience, and whether this once covert survival tactic could be repurposed for an era seeing shifting relationship norms.

A heteronormative front
The phrase "lavender marriage" mainly gained traction in early 20th-century Hollywood, where image was paramount and being openly queer could have ended careers.
The unions between a man and a woman — with either one or both partners being homosexual — provided a heteronormative cover so that stars and other public figures could maintain their reputations while shielding their true sexual orientation.
These weren't romantic partnerships but calculated arrangements, often orchestrated by studios or agents during an era when homosexuality was criminalized or frowned upon.
An oft-cited example is Rock Hudson, an icon of Hollywood's Golden Age. He married his agent Henry Willson's secretary, Phyllis Gates, to thwart tabloid press attempts to out him.
Hudson spent his life hiding his true sexual identity to preserve his leading man persona and died of an AIDS-related illness in 1985.

Why 'lavender'?
"Lavender," both the term and color, has long accompanied LGBTQ+ history.
Ancient Greek poetess Sappho passionately wrote about the delicate beauty of women, referencing "wreaths, garlands or diadems of violets being placed on the 'slender neck' of a girl."
Incidentally, though the sexual identities we now recognize hadn't yet been named in her era, the words "sapphic" and "lesbian" derive from her name and her home island of Lesbos.
While Sappho's sexuality remains moot, her poetry celebrating same-sex love has made her an LGBTQ+ iconImage: akg-images/picture alliance
Centuries later, Irish author Oscar Wilde would describe his same-sex liaisons as "purple hours" that gave him joy in "the grey slowly-moving thing we call Time!" 
By the 20th century, lavender became associated with gay men and lesbian women but also devolved into a slur at times. The 1950s "Lavender Scare" in the US saw leaders like Senator Joseph McCarthy explicitly associating homosexuality with subversion and disloyalty, which led to the firing or forced resignations of gay civil servants.
This in turn fueled the LGBTQ+ rights movement that claimed lavender as its color of solidarity and protest.
A TikTok reimagining
Fast forward to the digital age, and lavender marriage has been reinterpreted — sometimes earnestly, sometimes playfully — by Gen Z creators on TikTok. Videos tagged #lavendermarriage show users touting themselves as potential partners, lamenting the chaos of dating, and imagining platonic domestic bliss.

In September 2024, TikToker Robbie Scott was among the first to kick off the trend when he announced applications were open for potential lavender marriage partners.
"I can be your husband, I can be your wife, I can be your dog, I can be whatever the f**k you want me to be," he said in the video. "All you have to do is marry me so that I can afford to pay a mortgage, utilities, and taxes, that's it. You can mess around with whoever you want whenever you want. In fact, I encourage it." 


Romance doesn't pay the bills
While the TikTok trend may seem tongue-in-cheek, it reflects deeper shifts in how people view relationships. Marriage need not always be about romantic love. For some, it's a legal contract that offers tangible benefits — tax breaks, health insurance, immigration status or even co-parenting rights. Not all that different from the arranged marriages of yore among European royalty or even among some societies where they're still the norm.
In countries like the United States, with rising healthcare and housing costs, marrying a trusted friend could offer stability. For others, it's about choosing emotional safety over romantic volatility or sexual compatibility, and building a mutually respectful partnership based on shared values and goals.

Still a shield in some societies
Beyond the TikTok trend, the original iteration of lavender marriages provide a shield to individuals living in societies where LGBTQ+ lifestyles are still criminalized or culturally taboo.
In China, "xinghun" (or "cooperative marriage") enables LGBTQ+ partners to agree on living arrangements that meet familial or societal expectations while privately preserving individual orientations.
On a wider spectrum, lavender marriages could also offer protection from workplace discrimination or violence in general.
Within this context, some critics argue that TikTok's broader appropriation of the term as a "platonic legal arrangement with benefits" glosses over the oppression experienced by queer individuals. 
"The original concept of a lavender marriage is deeply tied to queer history and the strugglesLGBTQIA+ individuals faced in navigating oppressive societal structures," sociologist Jennifer Gunsaullus told Cosmopolitan. "Repurposing it without acknowledging this history can erase the very real and often painful reasons these marriages existed."
Experts also warn that there's an emotional toll. Living within marriages that conceals one's true self — whether for protection or convenience — could still lead to loneliness, resentment or identity conflict. Even in platonic arrangements, expectations must be clearly defined to avoid misunderstandings.

Love through lavender-tinted glasses?
The reboot of lavender marriages is just one of several labels in the history and evolution of relationship arrangements. For instance, at the turn of 20th century, the term "Boston marriage" was in use to refer to two women living together, independent of a man's financial support.
Reflecting a broader cultural shift, namely the conscious decoupling of marriage from romance, #lavendermarriage raises the questions: What does it mean to build a life with someone? And who decides what love, partnership or marriage should look like?

In the scorching heat, a long line of rental cars stretching for kilometers struggles up a winding road. On this late summer morning, an army of vacationers heads for Valldemossa.
The picturesque mountain village is one of the most popular destinations on the Spanish island of Mallorca, and, as in years past, traffic jams on the narrow mountain road are once again a daily occurrence.
The chaos isn't just a problem for the holidaymakers: a bus carrying mainly commuters on their way to work is also stuck in traffic.
"This is unbearable," grumbles one of them, with a glance at the seemingly endless stop-and-go traffic.

19 million vacationers in the Balearic Islands
Opposition to mass tourism has been growing on the Balearic Islands for years, just as in other parts of Spain, and often erupts in protests.
Despite this, the islands are heading for a new visitor record this year. By late July, almost 11 million people had spent their holidays in the archipelago, which is made up of Mallorca, Minorca, Ibiza and Formentera.
That's a slight increase relative to the same period last year. For the whole of 2024, the figure was 18.7 million.
In 2025, that number is set to rise to more than 19 million — or about one in five of all international visitors to Spain.

Although the figures may appear promising on the surface, Mallorca's tourism industry feels it has little to celebrate. Restaurateurs, retailers and operators of tourist attractions all say their sales figures are significantly down.
Fewer Germans travelling to Mallorca
Ironically, they're most worried about the lack of German tourists, whose numbers have fallen dramatically this summer compared to last year, by more than 8% in July alone.
Traditionally, Germans make up by far the largest group of holidaymakers in Mallorca. That's why many involved in Mallorca's tourism industry are sounding the alarm.
Pedro Oliver, chairperson of the Balearic Tourist Guides Association, is convinced that anti-tourism rallies are partly to blame.
"I've no doubt they've had an effect: the message has been received," says Oliver. He and his colleagues have noticed that something has changed.
"Tourists are constantly asking whether it's true that Mallorca no longer wants vacationers," he says.
Rafel Roig, chairman of the Balearic Transport Federation, takes a similar view. "It's obvious: if I hear I'm not wanted in a place, then I'm not going to go there."


Rising summer temperatures could be a factor
Alvaro Blanco from Spain's Tourism Office in Berlin, doubts that German vacationers are being deterred by the anti-tourism demonstrations.
His office has received just two emails from concerned German citizens on the matter in recent months.
"I don't think the protests are having any impact," says Blanco, adding that Germany's economic challenges could be a more decisive factor.
He also suspects that some travelers may simply be staying away from southern Europe because of rising temperatures in the summer months.

Carlos Cendra from Mabrian, a consulting firm specializing in tourism, also thinks Germans are staying away from Mallorca for economic reasons, especially considering the significantly increased prices on the island.
Hotel prices strain holiday budgets
For years now, Mallorca's tourism industry has been striving to improve quality. This is most evident from the more luxurious accommodation on offer nowadays: over the past 20 years, the number of four- and five-star hotels has tripled, as one- to three-star hotels disappear from the market.
This, in turn, has brought a rise in prices.
When it comes to marketing, the Balearic government has also been casting the net wider, stepping up advertising in the United States, for example. This year, an unusually large number of French, Italian and Scandinavian tourists visited the island, more than compensating for the decline in German tourists.

In 2025, the islands looks to be heading for another record. Although the regional government says the archipelago is at capacity, the administration has so far shied away from any measures to restrict tourism.
After much back and forth, the government still couldn't bring itself to raise the accommodation tax, introduce a special levy on rental cars or impose stricter rules on vacation rentals. Dependence on tourism is too great, as is the concern that demand could actually decline.
Protests set to continue
For Jaume Pujol, the spokesperson for the platform Menys turisme mes vida (Less Tourism, More Life), nothing has really changed on Mallorca.
"This summer was no different from the previous ones," he says.
The group has organized several large demonstrations against the excesses of mass tourism.
But the "streets were crowded again this year, and the healthcare system was overloaded. The logic of growth remains unchanged," says Pujol, adding that more demonstrations are on the horizon, including a major rally next year.
"The issue remains relevant," he says.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[“日本拉面相当有名，特别是一兰拉面，全世界游客到访日本都要去尝尝。但包括一兰在内，还有二郎系拉面、九州拉面、博多拉面等等，大都可以认为是预制菜。”近日，在日本食品出口展网站上，一位中国博主的文章引发关注。文章写道：“可以把拉面理解为稍微健康的预制菜，面条、叉烧、笋片，甚至温泉蛋、汤头，都是在工厂里包装好运到后厨，然后厨师将面条煮熟，把食材摆放在一起就好。”
 
日本自20世纪五六十年代开始发展预制菜产业，如今预制菜已成为国民餐桌上的常态。从便利店的即食便当，到超市货架上琳琅满目的预制菜品，再到餐馆后厨标准化的预制食材，预制菜无处不在。

生活在日本的沙铭，每隔一段时间去便利店都会发现新品，货架的摆放秩序也不断变化，许多预制食品拿回家加热就能吃。“我最爱吃的是一款意大利面，里面有鱼子酱和奶酪。买完就可以用店里的微波炉加热，食品包装上标注了加热时间。”她告诉《中国新闻周刊》。
 
吃预制菜，在日本社会是一件很普遍的事。前述中国博主的文章介绍：“日本老百姓的做饭日常就是：超市净菜切一切+调味料一冲+搁锅里一炖，或者在微波炉把早市买的便当‘叮’一下，就是一桌菜了。”
 
从国际上看，美国、日本预制菜的渗透率早已达60％以上。以日本为代表的预制菜大国，为何对预制菜接受度这么高？
 
便利至上
 
王宏鑫在2006年来到日本留学。当时，超市里的冷柜还不多，售卖的蔬菜、肉类、海鲜多是已处理、清洗好的盒装半成品。作为“没时间做饭”的留学生，他第一次感受到了生活的便利。
 
后来，他见证着超市里的冷链区域不断扩大，冷冻食品的种类也愈加丰富。“超过90％的日本料理可以制成冷冻食品进入超市，中华料理类冷冻食品的市场份额也在增长。”他告诉《中国新闻周刊》。
 
毕业后，他从事中日食品贸易业务已有十多年，并在2017年创办了时行株式会社，专注做中国预制食品出口日本的生意。目前，公司每年稳定向日本出口6个货柜约150吨的预制小龙虾，除了调味小龙虾，还有清水虾、虾尾、纯虾肉等产品。“以往主要给中华物产店供货，从去年开始，日系超市也开始采购我们的产品。”
 
“在日本，很多超市在早上都会上架大批量的惣菜（预制菜），像寿司、牛丼、煎饺、唐扬鸡块、渍物（腌菜）、咖喱、沙拉、可乐饼、炸鱼饼、越南卷，全部都是预制菜。当然保质期很短，只有一天，到了晚上还没卖掉的话就会打折。”前述中国博主的文章介绍。沙铭也提到，日本主要有半预制、冷冻食品、冷藏食品、常温保存食品、半成品等，保存条件和保质期长短各有不同。

在美国和日本，市场的增长，主要由经济高速发展后国民需求的改变驱动。20世纪50年代，以肯德基为代表的美国快餐业崛起，食品以半成品形态进驻全球门店。20世纪六七十年代，日本经济高速增长，由于本土食品资源匮乏，日本政府于1965年出台“冷藏链劝告”，大力扶持速冻食品企业以及冷链建设，肯德基、麦当劳、吉野家等快餐品牌也迅速发展。
 
据国信证券研报，在这一背景下，企业端（B端）需求受学校供餐制度驱动，团餐标准化需求上升，冷冻食品产值快速提高。20世纪90年代，日本泡沫经济破裂，在老龄化、单身化、家庭小型化、女性就业率上升等社会人口趋势的推动下，出于便捷性需求，消费者端（C端）也迎来拐点，延续了产值增长。
 
时至今日，“做饭简单方便”的需求仍在影响日本年轻人的选择。今年2月，日本冷冻食品协会对1250名25岁以上的消费者进行了调查。结果显示，受访者食用冷冻食品的频率同比增长了20％，约28％的女性、31％的男性每周食用2—3次。饺子、冷冻蔬菜，乌冬面/荞麦面/拉面、意大利面，以及炒饭/烩饭等品类受到欢迎。
 
在一些发达国家，不花时间做饭、便利至上是共识。李明在德国从事餐饮行业市场拓展工作，她告诉《中国新闻周刊》，德餐的品类没有法餐、意餐丰富，高度的工业化发展也塑造了德国人的生活习惯，“大家中午也不去外面就餐，习惯到超市买个预制汉堡或三明治。即便有在家做饭的习惯，也是从超市购买半成品、冷冻食品，快速完成制作”。
 
为此，商家要不断进行产品、技术创新。日本食品巨头日冷集团的发家产品，正是一款看似平平无奇的炒饭。2001年，日冷集团推出“正宗炒饭”。此前，市场上冷冻米饭的口感更接近于拌饭，与真正的炒饭相差较远。日冷集团研发了特殊的炒菜技术与设备，让每一粒大米被蛋液包裹，通过蛋液和油脂的润滑防止大米粘连，实现了粒粒分明的效果。产品一经推出就获市场欢迎，二十多年来始终位居同品类全球销量第一。
 
最近几年，预制的中华料理在日本受到欢迎，也是因为便利。据王宏鑫介绍，预制小龙虾采取了速冻锁鲜的技术。凭借这一技术，经冷冻的麻辣、蒜香、十三香等调味小龙虾，能在消费者解冻的过程中逐渐吸收调料入味。相比于购买半成品、回家现炒的方式，冷冻制品不仅节约时间，入味效果也更好。
 
近几年，他也持续向日本市场引进其他预制技术成熟的中国产品，如虾饺，以及烤鱼、剁椒鱼、酸菜鱼等调味鱼片。“以鱼类食品为例，日本的消费者是吃不完一整条鱼的，得做一人食分量。我们要切成鱼片，并将1/2或1/4的鱼片调味后制成产品，才能面向零售市场。”
 
连锁扩张的必然
 
2010年，沙铭开始带领国内的餐饮企业去日本考察，后来创立了北京玖玖一番餐饮管理有限公司，她负责中日餐饮交流研学业务。她发现：“从2014、2015年开始，国内餐饮企业的需求明显升级了，要求学习国外的供应链管理，以及如何与连锁模式对接。”
 
连锁品牌的扩张是一个系统工程，需要建设中央厨房作为食品制造中心和供应链的核心，实现运营的标准化，优化人力成本，提升效率。
 
沙铭对日本一家做乡土料理的连锁面店印象深刻，店里也售卖炒饭、煎饺等，在日本快速扩张了数百家门店。其中，面和炒饭等主食由中央厨房制作，包菜等净菜由中央厨房切配，搭配酱料包配送到店现场炒制，店员只需加热和配上调料即可，即便如此味道也很不错。

她表示，与国内情况不同，日本OEM中央厨房（第三方中央厨房）的分类非常细，一家企业往往长期服务于某一类需求，例如分别为大型超市、餐饮店、老人餐、学生餐的需求服务；品类区分也很严格，鱼类，肉类（如牛肉、猪肉、鸡肉等），蔬菜都会具体到细分种类。她曾去过一家专门做葱的加工厂，机器快速地去除头和葱叶，根据大中小号进行加工装配。“这也有助于食品的溯源。”她说。
 
这样的流水线体系，打造出了日本一系列连锁化餐饮品牌。
 
国信证券社会服务团队的一份研报指出，在日本，牛丼饭、汉堡、回转寿司行业的CR4（行业前四名份额集中度指标）最高，分别为100％、96％和78％，供应链和门店运营的效率化是头部连锁企业的关键。
 
日本的牛丼饭行业由食其家、吉野家和松屋三家企业主导。随着中央厨房的深度普及，牛丼饭标准化程度得到极大提升，门店后厨只需进行加热。
 
上述研报分析，上市公司泉盛集团于1982年创立了食其家品牌，全球门店数现已超万家。2000年之前，食其家通过中央厨房模式在日本扩张门店。2000—2006年，集团横向收购餐饮公司，主要沿着牛肉、米这一核心原材料，收购主打牛排、汉堡牛肉、烤肉、寿司等产品的品牌，进一步提高了国际采购中的议价能力。凭借规模优势，采购、物流成本大幅降低。
 
另一方面是追求极致的人效。针对食其家员工，泉盛集团会进行秒级培训，将牛丼上菜时间控制在10秒内。为提高效率，日本的回转寿司店还会采用寿司机器人、自动计数和集水系统。
 
这一模式也被复制到国内。据前瞻产业研究院统计，国内吉野家的预制餐食使用比例接近100％。据公众号新榜的“声量通AI报告”，有超90％的消费者认为中央厨房加工等于预制菜。基于这一认知，可以说日本的快餐店、寿司、拉面店“做的都是预制菜”，尤其是头部连锁企业。
 
美味不与新鲜画等号
 
在日本，主流快餐品牌普遍采取平价策略。不过，大众餐厅的价格定位并不直接与中央厨房介入的程度有关。
 
沙铭介绍，日本的餐厅分类有低、中、高档，人均定价分别为1000—1500日元、3000—5000日元、6000—10000日元，不同档位都有偏快餐模式和偏精品模式的餐厅，后者则会更注重服务和餐食的精美制作。至于是否采用中央厨房模式，往往取决于经营者的需要。
 
刘金成有近25年的日料烹饪、开店经验，在中国和日本都开过中高端日料餐厅并担任主厨，也任玖玖一番的日餐负责人。“国人对预制菜的看法带有一些贬义色彩，认为预制菜的品质不好，美味必须与‘新鲜’画等号。”他对《中国新闻周刊》感叹。
 
但在他看来，在冷冻技术、食品安全有保障的前提下，延长时间一定程度上也能促进食材和料理的美味。

他解释，制作寿司要用到的醋饭，所用醋的种类、拌醋时间长短会影响口感的刺激性、柔软性，不同餐厅有自己的计算。活鱼处理一段时间后，肉质会变硬，需要在冰箱中控温储存一段时间使其变软，口感才更适宜，算上熟成的时间，有时需要一个星期。同理，生牛肉通常需要48—72小时的排酸，若再使用干式或湿式的熟成方法，牛肉还需在3—4度的环境中经历3个月、半年甚至2年。
 
以日本广受欢迎的鳗鱼饭为例，从市场进货后，先处理活鱼，再用开水烫表面，去除黏膜，进行切割，随后再上蒸笼蒸15分钟，洒上酒并放凉，包上保鲜膜后冷冻，主厨往往会同时处理一批鱼。客人完成点菜后，拿出冷冻制品完成解冻，烤火刷酱、浇上调制的鳗鱼汁即可。这也保证了制餐效率、出餐速度。
 
日本有一种著名的高端料理形式“主厨料理”（omakase），普通定价人均1万—2万日元，在高档餐厅可达人均2万—5万日元甚至更高。主厨会亲自采购食材、拟定菜单，并在客人面前现场烹饪，烹饪完即刻呈上，过程可见且有互动。
 
“这不意味着从零开始现做。”刘金成表示，定好菜单后，主厨就开始挑选食材，进行漫长的备餐流程。就餐时，主厨需提前和客人讲解，各种食材经过了多长时间的处理，客人往往会认可主厨的用心。
 
餐厅使用外部品牌预制食品的情况，也被普遍接受，例如裙带菜、芥末章鱼、厚蛋玉子烧等。他表示，身为经营者和主厨，应把关供货渠道的安全资质、制作的工艺流程，最终对“美味”负责。
 
食品安全是防线
 
日本预制菜加工业的高门槛，给王宏鑫留下了深刻的印象。他介绍：“预制菜加工企业要遵守严格的食品卫生法，法律明确规定了添加剂的使用场景及用量，相关部门对工厂的持续监管也非常严格。”
 
日本规定添加剂要遵循“合法，必要，适量”，认为非法添加或超范围地使用添加剂掩盖品质缺陷，会产生巨大的食品卫生风险。以防腐剂为例，日本一袋保质期为9个月的火锅底料，被允许的防腐剂添加量小于0.05％，100g火锅底料里面的防腐剂含量必须在0.05g以下。
 
“这意味着，食品加工企业要更多研究如何通过低温或高温杀菌、密封包装、冷链与HACCP（危害分析和关键点控制），在不依赖或减少添加剂的前提下，实现延长保质期、提升稳定性的效果。”王宏鑫说。
 
德国也对食品安全建立了非常高的标准体系。李明介绍，以欧盟的统一法规为基础，德国的食品安全体系可以说是全世界最严格的。德国超市里的豆腐普遍偏硬，是因为食品安全法规要求其必须采用充分的热杀菌工艺。
 
日本非常重视食品安全的全链条管理。以冷冻食品为例，日本的全链条品质管理体系由“食品卫生法＋加工许可证及资质＋HACCP管理制度＋冷链温控＋严格的时间控制+标签追溯”构成。
 
沙铭表示，日本的中央厨房和食品加工行业会严格执行“中心温度检测”流程，使用专业温度计探针，在食材入库时进行中心温度检测，以验证冷链运输环节是否达标。“例如，冷藏蔬菜的中心温度规定为0—3度。一旦检测超出范围，则意味着食材新鲜度与安全风险已不可控，必须退货处理。”
 
此外，日本预制菜监管体系要求加工、运输和储存流程都遵循“可记录，可追溯，可拒收”原则，一旦违规会严格追责。
 
王宏鑫解释，关键在于，监管部门收录了原材料产地或养殖场、供货商、加工企业、收货和出售日期等一系列中间环节信息。消费者一旦反映问题，监管部门可以从通过产品标签向上追溯，控制住出问题的具体批次，并通过媒体通知主动召回，提供相应补偿，对问题厂家进行处罚。
 
在受访者看来，日本等国还没有明文规定要求餐厅告知消费者“菜品是否为预制菜”。经营者和消费者形成共识的基石，在于严格的食品安全体系。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[In 1964, China detonated a 22-kiloton nuclear device at a test site in the arid northwestern Xinjiang region—and the political fallout reached Washington. Worried about the prospect that many countries around the world would soon gain nuclear weapons, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson convened a committee of seasoned foreign policy leaders to advise him on what Washington should do to prevent proliferation. Led by the former U.S. deputy secretary of defense Roswell Gilpatric, the group asked what an increase in nuclear-armed states would mean for U.S. security, what assurances the United States could realistically offer states that decided to forgo nuclear weapons, and how far Washington should go to prevent more states from acquiring them.
The Gilpatric committee’s conclusion was unanimous: averting the spread of nuclear weapons to any state, friend or foe, should be a top national security priority. To achieve that end, the committee provided a policy blueprint that Washington then went about implementing. Acting on the group’s advice, U.S. officials began negotiating multilateral nonproliferation treaties and agreements, including, controversially, accords with the Soviet Union. The United States also developed measures to cajole and coerce other countries into remaining nonnuclear, including extending security assurances, supporting civilian scientific endeavors, and threatening to cut off military support and impose economic penalties on proliferating states. Thanks in large part to such initiatives, U.S. efforts to combat proliferation over the last 60 years have succeeded more often than they have failed. Only nine states possess nuclear weapons, and only North Korea has acquired them in the twenty-first century.
But the nuclear landscape is changing in ways that are bringing proliferation back to the fore. An increasingly powerful China is scaling up its nuclear arsenal. Russia has backstopped its war in Ukraine with threats of nuclear use. Iran’s nuclear program was set back by recent U.S. and Israeli attacks, but it was not destroyed. U.S. allies, worried about their security and unsure about Washington’s commitment to their defense, are also mulling going nuclear. And evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence are making it easier than ever for states to build the bomb. Against this backdrop, the Cold War–era tools and tactics that Washington has long relied on to manage proliferation challenges are eroding. The international treaties and regimes that govern nuclear issues, particularly the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), are badly frayed. Great-power cooperation on nuclear dangers has stalled.
These are storm clouds that American policymakers cannot ignore. So last year, drawing inspiration from the Gilpatric committee, we convened a bipartisan task force of senior national security leaders and experts to assess how nuclear proliferation is evolving and to make recommendations on how the United States can reinvigorate its approach. Despite differing views on a variety of security issues, the group, like Gilpatric’s, reached a clear consensus: nuclear proliferation by any additional country would diminish U.S. power, complicate strategic planning, and increase the likelihood of nuclear use, accidents, and disasters.
But preventing proliferation will require a revamped approach. Instead of relying extensively on international treaties and great-power cooperation to control the supply of nuclear technologies, Washington will need to focus more on reconfiguring security alliances and pursuing new risk-reduction measures, including with competitors, that curtail the demand for nuclear weapons. The U.S. government will have to reassure its allies that it will come to their defense and harness new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, that can strengthen international monitoring capabilities and make it harder to conceal illicit activities.


None of these steps will be easy, given the world’s many divisions. But they are essential to preventing the emergence of new nuclear states—and thus enormous new risks.
THE TRIPOLAR MOMENT
The Soviet Union and the United States agreed on little. But throughout the mid-to-late twentieth century, the two countries sustained a high degree of cooperation in establishing and enforcing a global network of treaties, institutions, technology controls, and practices to inhibit nuclear proliferation. The cornerstone of this system is the NPT, which opened for signature in 1968 and now enjoys close to universal membership. Moscow and Washington upheld nonproliferation cooperation across all kinds of ups and downs in their relationship, including after the Cold War ended.
China was historically more skeptical of nonproliferation institutions and policies. But after joining the NPT in 1992, it also began participating, albeit selectively, in efforts to avert the further spread of nuclear weapons. For example, China, Russia, and the United States cooperated to stop North Korea’s nuclearization during the 1990s and early 2000s, although they ultimately failed. They later partnered with European powers to negotiate and implement the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. This successfully limited Iranian enrichment of uranium—until U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the accord three years later.
But recently, both Moscow and Beijing have begun to dial down their efforts. To advance its war against Ukraine, Russia has embraced military cooperation with both Iran and North Korea. In exchange for their support, it has ignored Tehran’s and Pyongyang’s nuclear advances, voting in international forums to protect Iran from censure and bartering for North Korean weapons in violation of a UN arms embargo on North Korea. More concerning, Russian nuclear saber rattling has reanimated concerns in Europe and elsewhere that revisionist powers might use nuclear coercion to pursue wars of aggression. In 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that he was suspending Moscow’s participation in the New START treaty, which was negotiated with the United States in 2010 and is the last remaining bilateral agreement governing strategic nuclear arsenals. For now, Russia continues to adhere to the treaty’s central limits, and Putin recently offered to extend those limits for an additional year. But the details of what Russia has proposed, let alone what it will do, remain unclear, and the prospects of a successor treaty to replace New START when it expires in early 2026 appear dim. It is now common to hear people in Kyiv and other European capitals say that only the bomb can guarantee a state’s survival.
China’s rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal and more aggressive regional military posture add yet another layer to this challenge. What has historically been a bipolar nuclear order is transforming into a tripolar one. Beijing and Washington share common interests in preventing other states from developing nuclear weapons, but they have far less experience cooperating on nuclear issues than Moscow and Washington do. Moreover, Beijing likely sees solidifying a geopolitical counterweight to the United States and its allies as more important than preventing Iranian proliferation or reining in North Korea’s nuclear expansion.
KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE
Like its adversaries, many allies and close partners of the United States have flirted with the idea of acquiring nuclear weapons. In fact, many of Washington’s greatest nonproliferation success stories involved these states. American officials used a variety of tools to stymie their nuclear weapons ambitions, but one of the chief instruments was a willingness to extend protection to allies by bringing them under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. These arrangements played a crucial role in preventing the wave of proliferation that appeared imminent in the 1960s and 1970s. In practice, this involves maintaining a large defense and security network in key regions, including the forward deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe.
The U.S. alliance system is expensive, but it has done much to help Washington. U.S. officials have long believed that it would be harder to manage crises and prevent the use of nuclear weapons if more partners acquired nuclear arsenals. Extending deterrence has also afforded Washington significant influence over security dynamics in East Asia and Europe, where the United States has used its nuclear umbrella to cultivate valuable economic, political, and military relationships.


Yet growing threats from China, North Korea, and Russia have made U.S. allies question the credibility and sustainability of the security umbrella, particularly given the recent shifts in U.S. policy. Although doubts about whether the United States would truly risk nuclear war on behalf of its allies have always existed, such concerns have deepened in light of Washington’s costly trade disputes, its criticisms of allies’ “free-riding,” and its discussions on reducing the U.S. military presence abroad. These allies are also unsettled by Washington’s periodic overtures to long-standing adversaries, particularly Russia. As a result, in recent years, current and former leaders and prominent security analysts in a variety of U.S. partner countries—including Germany, Japan, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea—have openly discussed the need for independent nuclear arsenals or alternative security arrangements that would reduce their dependence on the United States.

 The United States can encourage its allies to invest more in deterrence.
Some American analysts and officials have argued that the prospect of nuclear weapons acquisition by select allies may not be so bad and that it would help reduce the United States’ defense burden and vulnerability to a nuclear attack. But in reality, nuclear proliferation by U.S. allies could trigger destabilizing reactions from adversaries, increasing the likelihood of escalating regional conflicts. It could also make it harder for the United States to influence the behavior of allies and undercut efforts to thwart the nuclear weapon ambitions of unfriendly states, such as Iran.
Rather than encourage allies to develop nuclear weapons of their own, Washington should work with them to develop a new extended deterrence compact by updating the basic security bargains and divisions of labor that provide for mutual defense. Such an agreement should retain the U.S. nuclear umbrella for strategic deterrence while strengthening the conventional defenses of allies so they are better equipped to handle military threats from China, North Korea, and Russia. In turn, allies must better understand that their conventional military forces and American capabilities, conventional and nuclear, are part of one system for deterring threats and responding to attacks.
The United States can encourage its allies to invest more in deterrence by pairing steps to reinforce U.S. commitments with reciprocal and timely contributions from partners. Many allies are already increasing defense spending and augmenting their military capabilities, but this is only a start. In terms of hardware, allies need to acquire additional military systems, including conventional strike capabilities and integrated and layered missile defenses, that complement U.S. capabilities. Nonnuclear weapons have more range and utility than they did when extended deterrence arrangements were first established during the Cold War; as a result, they can serve as the first line of defense against aggression. But these countries must also invest in newer systems, such as anti-drone weapons. Recent events, including the incursion of Russian drones into Polish and Romanian airspace this month, underscore the urgency of adjusting to evolving forms of warfare. Poland, for example, was able to shoot down the drones, but only by scrambling its fighter jets. And relying on expensive missiles and planes to intercept cheap drones is not sustainable.
Equally critical, the United States and its allies must improve military and political coordination. Tokyo and Washington’s decision last year to elevate alliance discussions on extended deterrence to the highest levels of government is a positive step in this direction. Deeper coordination to prepare for nuclear crises would also help allies understand how their contributions are critical to deterrence and increase their confidence that the United States would take action on their behalf. Washington can further reassure its friends by repeatedly and publicly reiterating its commitment to protect them.
COMMON GROUND
As it strengthens its alliances, the United States should also pursue pragmatic engagement with China and Russia to mitigate proliferation. The most direct way to do this would be for the three countries to engage in arms control and risk-reduction efforts. But realistically, the prospects for significant progress today are slim. Attempts to engage China and Russia in recent years have borne little fruit. Engaging with Russia is likely to be especially difficult as long as the war in Ukraine continues. And even if the United States suddenly found receptive partners in Beijing and Moscow, the emergence of a tripolar nuclear order calls for a fundamentally different approach to arms control. Attempting to equalize nuclear capabilities across the three powers cannot work.
The United States should nevertheless seek openings where it can. To begin, Washington should take up Putin’s suggestion to maintain the existing caps on their respective nuclear arsenals, which will otherwise be lifted when the New START treaty expires. U.S. officials should also propose a longer extension to New START while negotiators work on an agreement to replace it. In parallel, a senior U.S. official should signal to Chinese counterparts that Washington would be willing to discuss issuing a public statement in which the United States and China recognized their mutual nuclear vulnerability—a concept that has underpinned the nuclear relationship between Washington and Moscow for decades—as the first step in a bilateral process to identify and reduce nuclear risks. Separately, China, Russia, the United States, and the world’s other recognized nuclear weapons powers could jointly commit not to use, or threaten to use, nuclear weapons against countries that do not have them. This would demonstrate nuclear restraint and perhaps reduce the incentives for countries to seek nuclear weapons.
Both China and Russia can make unique contributions to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. As a close neighbor and key transit point for illicit North Korean activities, China could, for instance, step up efforts to uphold the UN arms embargo on North Korea. It could also address concerns about its own opaque and rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal. As the United States should tell China (behind closed doors), its nuclear buildup is stoking security anxieties in Asia and leading other countries in the region to contemplate developing their own nuclear weapons.



 China, Russia, and the United States have reason to cooperate on nuclear security.
Russia was particularly integral to negotiating and implementing the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and it has powerful leverage as the primary supplier to Iran’s civilian nuclear program. Should it choose to, it could help push Tehran into a new nuclear pact with limits and monitoring mechanisms that go beyond what was in the original. But even if Moscow won’t use its power to force through a new agreement, the United States can enlist Russia’s help in preventing the present situation from getting worse. Moscow could, for instance, press Tehran to fully restore its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which requires that Iran provide unimpeded access to inspectors, and avoid escalatory actions such as withdrawing from the NPT.
China, Russia, and the United States have reason to cooperate on other elements of nuclear security, even if they do not directly address rising proliferation threats. The states are all leaders in civilian nuclear technologies, with ambitious goals to expand nuclear energy projects domestically and abroad. Even as they compete for contracts and influence in the nuclear export marketplace, they maintain shared goals. Washington should therefore seek reinvigorated technical dialogues on promoting high standards for nuclear security and making sure that nuclear materials do not fall into the hands of smugglers or terrorists.
Addressing the intersection of nuclear proliferation and emerging technologies will also require global buy-in, including from China and Russia, and the updating of international safeguards and multilateral export regimes. Already, powerful AI models can be exploited by states to weaponize nuclear materials more quickly and cheaply or to circumvent monitoring and verification. Other developments, such as 3D printing and specialized machine tools, have likewise reduced some of the technical chokepoints to proliferation. At the same time, the United States and other countries can and should harness emerging technologies to thwart proliferation more effectively. Cheaper and more advanced sensor technologies could aid in the detection of illicit nuclear activities, making it harder for proliferators to hide.
ACROSS PARTY LINES
Fortunately, the vast majority of states still do not want nuclear weapons—in no small part because of the successes of U.S. strategy. But if even a handful of governments pursue the bomb, the world will be more volatile and dangerous. The United States thus retains an abiding interest in curtailing nuclear proliferation. American policymakers, after all, do not want to live in a world in which they must neglect key security priorities, such as homeland defense and technological competition, to focus on nuclear crises.
But to stop the further spread of nuclear weapons, Washington must address the rising interest in the bomb among its allies and bear in mind evolving threats from new technologies. It needs to bring Cold War–era security commitments into the twenty-first century, making them more reciprocal and responsive in ways that can mitigate allies’ fears of abandonment, strengthen collective defenses, and make U.S. defense burdens more sustainable. American strategy also needs to reflect a tripolar nuclear order. In the past, U.S. cooperation with Russia could focus mostly on building up the nonproliferation regime. Today, Washington will need to push Beijing and Moscow to temper behaviors that are driving countries to consider nuclear weapons of their own.
Averting proliferation in this geopolitical moment may seem difficult, and it will indeed require strong, bipartisan support to update U.S. strategy. But consensus is within reach when it comes to halting the spread of nuclear weapons, if only because the alternative would be far more costly for the United States and the world.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Policymakers and scholars in the West talk about Southeast Asia as a coherent region, but it has always been divided. The region’s 700 million people speak hundreds of languages and follow different religions, and its 11 countries vary in political system, size, geography, and level of economic development. Throughout the Cold War, Southeast Asia was divided between the five original founding members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that were aligned with the United States—Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand—and the three countries of Indochina—Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam—that aligned with China or the Soviet Union.
After the Cold War ended, ASEAN expanded to include Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, as well as the tiny sultanate of Brunei, increasing the salience of Southeast Asia as a geopolitical entity. Yet despite ASEAN’s achievements in fostering cooperation between its members, a cohesive Southeast Asia remains more myth than reality.
The reality is of two regions, not one. According to the Lowy Institute’s Southeast Asia Influence Index, which maps the sway of foreign partners across the region, two distinct networks persist among countries in Southeast Asia: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam form a continental group that leans toward China. Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore make up a maritime group in which the countries are well connected to one another, work with a wider array of governments from outside the region, and hedge between the United States and China. The Philippines is an outlier. It lacks close friends among other ASEAN countries and relies on non-Asian partners, particularly the United States, more than any of its neighbors.
The gap between these two networks of Southeast Asian countries is set to grow in the decades ahead, leading to a de facto Chinese sphere of influence in continental Southeast Asia. To prevent Beijing from encroaching even further, the United States should deepen ties with the countries that straddle Southeast Asia’s two subregions: Thailand and Vietnam.
BEIJING’S BACKYARD
Rugged, mountainous jungle separates China from Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam, and through these countries, Cambodia and Thailand. The anthropologist James Scott referred to this difficult landscape as “Zomia” and described how it prevented any state from fully controlling these highlands for much of the region’s history. In fact, these geographic barriers kept continental Southeast Asia apart from China for millennia and provided a natural limit to the expansion of the Chinese state. By the twenty-first century, however, technology has overcome terrain. Roads, railways, and special economic zones have facilitated more exchanges of people and goods between China and continental Southeast Asia.


Through its Belt and Road Initiative, China has provided financing for new infrastructure megaprojects, especially railways, across the region. Many of these projects have physically linked continental countries to China, which has changed the nature of their relationships with Beijing in a way that is not true for maritime states. In 2021, for instance, southern China was connected by rail to the Laotian capital, Vientiane. China’s ultimate vision is to attach this line to projects across Thailand and Malaysia to establish a rail link between Singapore and the Chinese city of Kunming. The effects of the railway have been profound for Laos, a small developing country that is now heavily indebted to China. The value of trade between the two countries has soared since the railway opened, much of it from agricultural exports farmed by Laotians on land leased to Chinese investors.

 A cohesive Southeast Asia remains more myth than reality.
Laos’s connections to China have a darker side, too. In the early years of this century, Laos set up special economic zones in a legitimate effort to encourage foreign investment. But today, they are ungoverned spaces in which Chinese businesspeople and even security forces can operate outside the confines of the law. Drug trafficking, wildlife crime, the unregulated migration of workers from Myanmar and other neighboring countries, and cyber-scams have proliferated in these areas. In effect, Laos lacks full sovereignty over much of its own territory. In Myanmar, civil war has slowed progress on the road and rail projects aiming to connect China with the Indian Ocean. But an oil and gas pipeline has continued to operate despite fierce fighting.
Even Vietnam, traditionally wary of Chinese influence, has drawn high levels of Chinese private investment because of the trade war between Washington and Beijing. Already, many companies have moved their supply chains from China to Vietnam, particularly its north—a shift from the historical norm in which southern Vietnam has been a more important center for trade and commerce. The U.S. tariff on Vietnamese products, at 20 percent, is still lower than those applied to Chinese goods, so China will likely continue to invest in Vietnam.
China has also funded railway projects in maritime Southeast Asia. In 2023, for example, a $7.3 billion high-speed domestic railway opened joining Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, with Bandung. Construction is underway on a project linking Malaysia’s east and west coasts by rail, at a cost of around $12 billion. Although these projects in maritime countries add to Beijing’s clout as an economic partner, they have not yet meaningfully connected either Indonesia or Malaysia to China.
FREE AND OPEN
Whereas continental Southeast Asia has, through its connection to China, been transformed over the past decade, this is not true of maritime Southeast Asia, which has always been exposed by its geography to many trading partners. The region’s two largest maritime countries, Indonesia and the Philippines, are immense archipelagos, and together with Singapore and Malaysia, straddle key waterways connecting Asia with the world. Just as Scott dubbed the highlands of continental Asia “Zomia,” the journalist Philip Bowring coined the term “Nusantaria” to describe Southeast Asia’s vast maritime expanses.
China has tried to assert control over the region’s central waterway, the South China Sea. This has alarmed countries around the globe, which need shipping lanes to remain free and open for trade. In 2016, a UN tribunal rejected China’s claims to the area within its “nine-dash line,” which covers almost the entire South China Sea. Since then, dozens of countries, as far afield as the United Kingdom, have supported the ruling, underscoring the global importance of these waterways.


Because maritime Southeast Asian countries are bigger and more important to worldwide commerce than continental states, they tend to receive investment and development finance from a larger pool of foreign donors. They also draw more interest when it comes to defense. Of the new defense cooperation initiatives between Western and Southeast Asian governments since 2017, most have been with maritime countries and Vietnam. Maritime countries, under more pressure from China’s sweeping maritime claims and steady encroachment in their exclusive economic zones, see the need to work with the United States and other Western countries. And the United States and its allies, particularly Australia and Japan, use maritime Southeast Asian countries to advance their own goals in relation to China. The United States views combined military exercises with the Philippines as a way to maintain access within the so-called first island chain, which separates China from the Pacific Ocean. Washington has stepped up military sales and cooperation with the Philippines, which has borne the brunt of China’s aggression at sea, as an investment in maintaining respect for international law and an attempt to prevent China from bending smaller countries to its will.
MIND THE GAP
Southeast Asia’s two sets of countries will continue to diverge. The region’s maritime states will remain open to many partners. China will be their biggest source of external influence but not by a huge margin, and many other countries, including the United States, Australia, India, and Japan, will attenuate Beijing’s sway. Continental Southeast Asia, on the other hand, is likely to become part of Beijing’s de facto sphere of influence. China won’t wield absolute power over these countries, but it will have much more leverage than any other state outside the region.
U.S. President Donald Trump appears drawn to the idea of spheres of influence. He seeks to reassert American dominance in the Western Hemisphere while showing greater deference to Russia’s interests in Europe. Perhaps the United States will ultimately see continental Southeast Asia as part of a natural sphere of influence for China. For a United States that is looking to reduce its international commitments, a decision to stop competing with China there may make sense.
Yet Washington should beware the consequences of such an arrangement. And if it does not want to undermine its own position in Southeast Asia, it should shore up ties with countries on the margins of Beijing’s zone of influence: Vietnam and Thailand. Vietnam is continental in character. It has a closed political system, history of aligning with the Soviet Union, deep ties with Cambodia and Laos, and growing links to China. But Vietnam is becoming more maritime in its outlook. For example, in 2023, it upgraded its relationship with the United States to a comprehensive strategic partnership—a sign it considered the United States to be a vital partner. The Trump administration has squandered such goodwill, treating Hanoi as an adversary in one-sided tariff negotiations, a move that risks long-term damage to U.S. standing in Vietnam.
The United States should also pay more attention to Thailand. The country, a Cold War ally and an advanced economy, has historically been friendly to many external partners, including Western ones. Yet since 2006, Thailand’s democracy has eroded, and Bangkok has deepened both economic and defense ties with Beijing. The United States must invest more in this alliance and avoid punitive actions that push Thailand into Beijing’s arms officials. Washington, for example, sanctioned Thai officials in March for deporting 40 Uyghur asylum seekers to China. By shoring up its ties with Vietnam and Thailand, the United States can help ensure that maritime Southeast Asia remains open, imposing a natural limit on China’s ability to dominate Asia and preserving U.S. interests in the wider Indo-Pacific region.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[With just weeks to go until the international climate conference, nations are stepping up to submit new climate targets for 2035. But will they be enough to prevent a climate catastrophe? 
    Rising temperatures are leading to more extreme weather events globally Image: Johannes P. Christo/Andalou/picture alliance   
"The stakes could not be higher," a senior UN official told reporters ahead of the UN Climate Summit in New York. Heavy flooding, drought and ever longer heatwaves are just some of the extreme weather events that have battered communities over the past summer alone. 
Climate disasters are "wreaking havoc" on every continent, the UN official added. 
Scientists say human-caused global warming is driving the changes in Earth's climate and that rising temperatures will mean worse impacts in the long run.
To try to tackle the climate crisis world leaders agreed to limit the average global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), pursuing efforts to cap it at 1.5 degrees.
The deal was sealed under the 2015 Paris Agreement, with countries promising to renew and communicate their commitments via a so-called NDC, or nationally determined contribution, every five years. 
The deadline for the 2035 NDC was in February, but few of the 195 parties that have ratified the accord met the date. Pressure is now on for nations to come forward with their commitments this week.
Big climate emitters are falling behind
With less than two months to go before the start of the international COP 30 climate summit, taking place in Belem, Brazil, only 47 countrieshad delivered their climate goals by time of publication — representing just 24% of global emissions.


Big emitters including the European Union, and India are among those yet to submit their national targets. Some nations that have put forward domestic targets, like Australia and Japan, have been criticized for not showing stronger ambition and doing their fair share.
Many countries are expected to come forward with proposals. More than 100 nations have registered to speak at the UN Climate Summit,taking place on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly meeting in New York.
So, what are countries promising? And what does it mean for action on global warming?
European Union: Climate leader?
With a conflict on its borders, economic problems in some member states and a general political shift to the right, agreeing on a united response to the climate crisis has proven difficult for the 27-state bloc. 
Just days before the climate summit, the EU indicated that it would not meet a deadline set by the COP30 Brazilian presidency to present its NDC before the end of September, instead issuing a statement of intent.
The document signaled the bloc's commitment to put forward a climate target before the November conference with a 2035 greenhouse gas reduction ranging between 66.25% and 72.5% compared with 1990 levels.
Stientje van Veldhoven, regional director for Europe at the World Resources Institute, said that while the statement showed "scope for progress", it risked "sending a confusing message, eroding investor confidence and undermining jobs, energy security, and competitiveness."

A proposal to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissionsby 90% by 2040 has been in the works for some time, but has yet to be agreed upon by all member states. Experts say the 2035 target would have an impact on that goal.
"The pathway matters: if the EU lands on the lower end of the range, like 66.3%, the final stretch to 90% just five years later will be a steep and uphill climb. That does not provide the long-term policy credibility that investors and companies need," added van Veldhoven.
China: Green energy giant
The world's biggest emitter, China, produces around a third of all greenhouse gas emissions and is under pressure to set an ambitious domestic reduction target.
However, its pledge to cut emissions by 7-10% from peak is both "underwhelming and transformative," Andreas Sieber, associate director of policies and campaigns at climate group 350.org, said in a statement.
He added that the reduction "falls short of what the world needs" but noted that it "anchors the world’s largest emitter on a path where clean-tech defines economic leadership." 
Speaking to DW before the target was announced, Li Shuo, the director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said that a decision-making factor in China's NDC was likely to be the EU's failure to submit its targets on time and the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. 
"I think those factors in general will present challenges to high ambition," he said. 
The new Chinese target uses the country's peak emissions as a baseline, with all likelihood that the nation has either already reached its peak emissions or will do so soon. 
Experts speaking before the announcement, which was made by Chinese President Xi Jinping in a video address to the climate summit, said that while China was likely to make a low pledge, it was a commitment that the country would probably meet and possibly even overshoot. 
"In the case of China, when they come up with a target, it's something that they are really committed to, to really fulfill," Sofia Gonzales-Zuniga, senior climate policy analyst with Climate Analytics, told DW. "In a way it could not be that it's not the most ambitious, but we can have a certain level of trust that they will reach what they are promising."

China is by far the globe's biggest investor in clean energy, with investment reaching around $625 billion in 2024 alone, according to the global energy think tank Ember,and Shuo said that was unlikely to change.
Brazil: The host with the most?
As host of the COP30 climate conference, Brazil has come under increasing scrutiny over its domestic targets.
Its plans to decrease its greenhouse gas emissions between 59 – 67% from 2005 levels by 2035 were met with criticism by experts who said that such a range created uncertainty and weakened accountability.
The country has also come under fire over plans to expand exploration of oil particularly around the mouth of the Amazon River.
However, Gonzales-Zuniga said that Brazil's recently published national strategy to reduce emissions adds clarity by specifying cuts in more specific sectors, for example, agriculture and deforestation, which account for three-quarters of the country's greenhouse gas emissions.


United Kingdom: The original gangster
Great Britain was the first country to initiate the Industrial Revolution, a period in history dating back to the mid-1700s, when fossil fuels were first burned to power industrial processes.

As one of the countries with the highest cumulative emissions — having emitted the most overall after the US, EU countries and China — some experts argue it has a particular responsibility to lower its emissions quickly.
And it seems that the former EU country has stepped up. As well as submitting its NDC on time, the UK government has promised to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 81% compared with 1990 levels.
"They came up with a target that, in terms of their domestic emissions reductions, would be 1.5-degree aligned. So that was really positive to see," said Gonzales-Zuniga, adding that compared to targets for 2030, it was "definitely an increase in ambition".
However, it's not as simple as that. The UK still needs to bridge the gap between its promises and the policies it needs to put in place to meet those pledges.
And there's more. According to the Carbon Action Tracker website, the UK's responsibility extends further than just domestic cuts. 
"They have a responsibility to provide climate finance to developing countries to reduce emissions outside their borders, to be able to say that they're really contributing in a fair way to reduce emissions," said Gonzales-Zuniga.
Indonesia: Phasing out fossil fuels
A high emitter in the Global South, experts say the climate goals due from Indonesia are ones to watch for.
With a reliance on fossil fuels and significant deforestation contributing to emissions, the island nation produces more than 3% of all global greenhouse gases, but that could be about to change.

President Prabowo Subianto has promised to phase out fossil fuel and coal-power plants within the next 15 years and wants to reach net zero by 2050, a full decade earlier than previously planned.
Speaking at the climate summit, Indonesia's Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir told UN officials that the country was committed to the Paris Agreement and planned to accelerate renewable energy, phase out coal and harness forests and mangroves as natural solutions to climate change.
However, he stopped short of offering specific targets for the country's domestic goals.
United States: The dropouts
Former US President Joe Biden submitted a climate target for the United States last year, pledging to reduce carbon emissions by 61% and 66% by 2035 compared to 2005 levels.
Since then, however, President Donald Trump has withdrawn the US from the Paris Agreement, essentially voiding the commitment. In a recent report, experts said the country had experienced its "most abrupt shift in energy and climate policy in recent memory".
Still, despite the policy U-turn, the report forecasts that the US is still on a path to reduce its greenhouse gases by 26 – 35% by 2035.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Scientists say we've already exceeded seven of nine planetary boundaries contributing to Earth's stability, life support and resilience. This poses a risk, but it's not all bad news.
    Planetary boundaries are being pushed into the danger zone, but scientists say there's still hope Image: Sergey Nivens/Shotshop/picture alliance   
If Earth were a hospital patient, it would likely be lying in the intensive care unit — that's the overall message from the new Planet Health Check 2025 report published by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).
"Right now, many parameters are outside the normal range, meaning they are classified as poor, and the patient Earth is in danger," said Boris Sakschewski, responsible for Earth system analysis at PIK and one of the report's lead authors.
"You could compare it to having high inflammation markers, high cholesterol, poor liver values, bad lung function, multiple things going wrong at once. Each one is dangerous on its own, but they can amplify each other," he added.
Researchers developed the benchmark for the Planetary Health Check in 2009. It revolves around the concept of planetary boundaries and outlines what humans need to do to avoid overburdening the planet.


The green circle in the graphic represents the safe zone. When a boundary is exceeded, the area turns orange, indicating an increasing risk, and then red, meaning severe consequences.
Biosphere: Code Red
The biosphere includes all layers of Earth inhabited by living organisms on land and in water. Scientists measure its health using two indicators: its productivity and what remains after human exploitation.
This area looks even worse than climate. Species extinction and loss of natural ecosystems are far beyond the safe zone needed for survival, and currently, there are no signs of improvement.
More than 47,000 species are threatened with extinction. That's 28% of all assessed species, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List Image: Hotli Simanjuntak/EPA/dpa/picture alliance

Excess nitrogen, phosphorus disrupt biogeochemical cycles
Over the past hundred years, humanity has doubled the amount of available nitrogen in nature through intensive livestock farming, synthetic fertilizers and combustion in industry and transport.
Nitrogen is vital for the growth and survival of all living organisms, but extreme over-fertilization has had many adverse side effects. Often, plants can't absorb all the nitrogen, which then seeps into groundwater, washes into rivers and lakes, and pollutes coastal marine zones.
There, it promotes the growth of certain algae, leading to oxygen depletion and, in the worst case, the death of all life in those areas. On land, fast-growing plants overtake species adapted to nutrient-poor conditions.

Overload of new substances means unforeseen long-term effects
Humanity produces and spreads nearly 350,000 substances that alter natural processes and threaten entire habitats. For comparison, organic life — whether a blue whale or bacterium — is mostly made up of just six elements: hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
The human-added new substances infiltrate all parts of Earth's system and have unexpected effects. Microplastics are found in drinking water, the insecticide DDT in fish, and PFAS, so-called "forever chemicals" that affect hormone systems in humans and animals, have been detected in sea foam along Germany's North and Baltic Sea coasts.

But even one additional substance can lead to global consequences, said Sakschewski.
"Now we're in a situation where thousands of substances are released into the environment untested, with new ones added every year. There's an urgent need for action and international regulations," he added.
Climate change: Earth's temperature is rising
Earth's climate is also in the danger zone. Greenhouse gas concentrations have reached record levels, far above pre-industrial reference values. Most concerning is the acceleration of global warming, shown by the so-called radiative forcing — a measure of how much additional heat enters Earth's atmosphere. Here, we've even crossed into the high-risk zone.
Global warming is primarily due to human emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2).
Code orange for freshwater resources…
Human impact on water bodies and soil moisture is increasing mainly driven by agricultural irrigation, industrial water use, domestic consumption and also due to human-driven climate change.
This further destabilizes water systems and raises the risk of droughts and floods. On more than one-fifth of the world's land surface, there are now significant deviations in dryness, water runoff and soil moisture.
…for land use...
The strain on Earth's resilience is even more pronounced in land use. Humans heavily intervene in natural systems through cropland, pasture, logging, settlements, and infrastructure. Climate change, changes in freshwater availability, and biosphere degradation also play a role here.

Although the rate of deforestation has slowed, the overall amount of forest worldwide continues to decline. Currently, global forest cover has dropped to just under 60% — well below the safe minimum of 75%. If forests shrink below 54%, we approach the high-risk zone here as well.
...and in the oceans
 The world's oceans absorb more than a quarter of the CO2 emitted by humans, preventing it from warming the climate. Instead, however, it turns into carbonic acid, lowering the natural pH level and causing ocean acidification. The more acidic the water, the harder it is for corals and shellfish to form their calcium-based shells and skeletons.
The oceans illustrate how closely the different planetary boundaries interact, said Sakschewski. High ocean temperatures — driven by climate change — combined with nitrogen and phosphorus inputs lead to so-called dead zones with almost no oxygen. This disrupts food webs, for example, the biosphere. And many of the novel substances, such as plastic, also end up in the ocean.


The good news: Two boundaries remain in the green zone
It's not all bad news: scientists say that two of the planetary boundaries are still within the green zone. Air pollution is continuing to decline and the ozone layer, which protects us from harmful cosmic radiation, is slowly, but steadily recovering.
The ozone layer is a prime example of how decisive action can reverse negative trends. Once it became clear that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were depleting the ozone layer, the global community banned their use through the Montreal Protocol.
However, that case involved just one substance, for which a quick replacement was found, said Sakschewski. The current threats are far more complex.
Still, the tight interconnections between planetary boundaries also offer opportunities and improving one area can positively impact others.
"If you protect carbon sinks — like rainforests — you also protect soil moisture, freshwater systems, the climate, and the biosphere. You have to understand the causal network of the Earth system," added Sakschewski.

The 2026 budget is currently being debated in the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag. The draft was presented by Finance Minister and Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil and will be deliberated for around two months before being voted on at the end of November.
The discussions will not be easy. Many ministries will have to work with significantly smaller budgets, because tax revenues are far from sufficient to cover government spending.
To kick off the budget talks, Klingbeil spoke of tough times ahead. The government, made up of the center-right bloc of Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) and the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), will have to make "courageous and sometimes uncomfortable decisions," he said. "It will be exhausting, it will be challenging."
The federal transport ministry had not really worried about being hit by budget cuts. After all, the renovation of the crumbling infrastructure is a top priority, and the government just recently launched a €500 billion ($587 billion) credit-financed special fund for infrastructure and climate protection. "In many areas, our country has been ruined by austerity. We want the excavators to get to work quickly," has been the credo of Finance Minister Klingbeil.

Transport Minister Patrick Schnieder expected his ministry to benefit enormously from this special fund. Clearly, transport routes such as roads, railways and bridges are all part of the federal infrastructure, and they are in poor condition.
Ailing transport infrastructure
The transport ministry has identified around 25,000 kilometers (15,500 miles) of highways that are in need of repair — that's almost a quarter of the entire network. The situation is particularly dire for highway bridges: around 5,000 bridges are considered to be in urgent need of repair, or must be rebuilt.
In fact, the rail network of state-owned Deutsche Bahn is so run-down that only every other train arrives at its destination on time.
In the current fiscal year, Klingbeil has allocated just under €12 billion from the special fund to the transport ministry. In 2026, this figure is set to rise to more than €21 billion. However, what Transport Minister Schnieder certainly did not expect was that Klingbeil would cut his basic budget by €10 billion.
Klingbeil denies that he is using the billions saved to plug holes in the budget. But sharp criticism has come from the opposition. They have pointed out that the government had promised that the loans from the special fund would be used exclusively to finance new investments.
The transport minister has also expressed his frustration. Not only because he will now receive less funding, but also because he will face additional restrictions. Now, no new construction or expansion projects may be financed from the special fund, with the exception of highway bridges that cannot be renovated.

Germany's billions in funds not enough to fix infrastructure

However, according to Schnieder, his reduced budget is no longer sufficient. "We are short by around €15 billion for the period from 2026 to 2029," Schnieder estimated in an interview with the German daily FAZ newspaper. He added that this would mean stopping and postponing 74 new motorway construction and expansion projects, as well as 99 federal highway projects that had already been planned. This primarily affects projects to complete missing sections of motorways or bypasses.


The transport minister is putting pressure on the Bundestag
The Bundestag's budget committee has requested a list from the transport ministry of all the routes affected. Schnieder has submitted the list and also added the electoral districts in which they are located. This allows every member of the Bundestag to see at a glance what the shortfall in financial planning means for them, their constituents, and local citizens.

In a harshly worded letter to Schnieder, the finance minister then pointed out that Schnieder had previously accepted the agreed-upon financial framework, and that no other sector was receiving more investment than the transport sector. A total of €166 billion is earmarked for transport investments by 2029. He said that it is now up to Schnieder to prioritize and use his funds effectively.
However, there is great outrage in the places affected by the construction freeze. The states are insisting that the federal government continue to finance planned projects to build and expand infrastructure.
At a parliamentary group meeting, Chancellor Friedrich Merz promised that everything would be done to enable the largest possible number of new construction projects.
The magic word for this is flexibility.The initial focus will be on renovation and maintenance. "In the coming budgets, we must then also turn our attention to more new road and rail construction," said Schnieder at the start of the budget deliberations in the Bundestag.
The SPD parliamentary group is sending mixed signals on this issue. The group's parliamentary secretary, Dirk Wiese, said that the principle of "maintenance before new construction" does not, of course, mean that all projects currently in the planning stage will be scrapped. However, he added that it is also the responsibility of the transport ministry to set priorities.

Encouraging private investment
It is safe to assume that the debate about new highways and expressways will not be the only controversy in the budget discussions — especially since the Bundesrechnungshof, Germany's top auditing institution which monitors how the state handles its money, is demanding greater austerity measures from the government. Its report on the 2026 budget states that almost every third euro is financed through credit. This, the auditors warn, is not sound financial management and could lead to a debt spiral.
Meanwhile, Chancellor Merz has put forward an idea. "Public investment alone cannot achieve what is needed in Germany and cannot make up for what we have neglected in recent years in terms of investment in our infrastructure." Private investors are greatly interested in investing in German infrastructure. "So, there could also be joint projects between the public sector and private investors. We plan to set up larger PPP projects with the Ministry of Transport."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Once a place for alternative lifestyles, now a monument surrounded by offices and luxury apartments: Few other places in Berlin symbolize change as much as the East Side Gallery. 
    Glass towers have enveloped the counterculture that once thrived on the perimeter of the East Side Gallery Image: Winfried Rothermel/picture alliance   
In 1990, the East Side Gallery was created on what today is the longest remaining section of the Berlin Wall, as some 118 artists from 21 countries created murals celebrating the fall of the divide.
Moscow artist Dmitri Vrubel was there to paint "Brotherly Kiss," an image of former Soviet Union leader Leonid Brezhnev and East German regime head Erich Honecker in a passionate embrace — which remains one of the gallery's most iconic works.
Along with the art, a counterculture flourished on the banks of the Spree River behind the former Wall as hundreds of people set up homes and creative spaces in caravans and improvised dwellings.

But 35 years later, these people are gone as the East Side Gallery — a tourist hotspot with millions of visitors annually — is overshadowed by real estate development. 
"The white buildings that have been constructed there are luxury apartments and hotels," Anna von Arnim-Rosenthal says as she stands between the Spree River and the Wall and points to a building complex on the other side of the riverbank.
A cultural historian who has been managing the East Side Gallery for the Berlin Wall Foundation since 2018, von Arnim-Rosenthal reflects on the radical changes in the area since the early-mid 1990s.
A wagon fort in the middle of Berlin
After 1991, artists and alternative types from around the world settled on the borderland of the former East Berlin when the area was still a wasteland. But already by 1996, under pressure from the Senate — and amid bad press claiming the area attracted crime and drugs — the site was cleared for urban development. The wagon dwellers inhabitating the area had to move on.

In the early 2000s, the banks of the Spree River were sold to US billionaire Philip Anschutz. "And that's why we now have high-rise buildings, hotels, the Uber Arena, offices, the mall, and so on," says von Arnim-Rosenthal of the massive development in the Friedrichshain area. "Alternative lifestyles have been pushed to another location."
The only remnants of the alternative trailer camps, or Wagenburgen, is a hole in the wall that the residents built there as a shortcut.
Rab Lewin, a Scotsman who lived temporarily in squats and trailer camps in Berlin from 1992, photographed these alternative communes — even though photography was prohibited in the so-called East Side Wagenburg.

His images portray the everyday life of the community and make it clear how much the area has changed.
"We are now standing exactly where Rab took the picture," says von Arnim-Rosenthal, holding his image of caravans standing close together amid a wasteland. The view today is marked by a towering Mercedes Benz star logo above a corporate glass building.
The Anschutz Group developed an entire urban quarter here with office buildings, hotels, and the Uber Eats Music Hall — in an area formerly known as the Mercedes-Benz Arena.

Meanwhile, there have been repeated protests against the Anschutz Group's projects, especially after the conservative evangelical entrepreneur, Philip Anschutz, was accused of financially supporting campaigns against the LGBTQ+ community.


Between development and preservation
The fact that Berlin drove out alternative lifestyles and supported the development of the area with luxury apartments and hotels must be viewed in historical context, says von Arnim-Rosenthal.
"People didn't really want the Wall in the cityscape anymore. There were only a few voices that wanted to preserve it," she explains. "So people tried to find compromises, to continue developing the city, but still preserve this place."
Despite the development, the East Side Gallery and its art and spirit of freedom is still there, she adds: "The idea was to reinterpret the Wall that cost so many people their lives and turn this place of fear and death into a place of art, encounters, and freedom."
The East Side Gallery manager stops in front of her favorite work of art: "The Diagonal Solution” by Russian artist Mikhail Serebryakov. The picture shows a raised thumb held up by a chain. "The artist's message is: make the best of a bad situation," she says.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Germany has the research expertise, a car production ecosystem and even test tracks for autonomous driving. But Europe's biggest auto nation still lags when it comes to putting self-driving cars on the road.
    NeMo's autonomous driving car concept was first presented at Paderborn Airport in September Image: Matilda Jordanova-Duda   
On the grounds of Paderborn Airport, engineer Michael Spengler demonstrates how far self-driving technology has come in Germany. He enters a route into his smartphone, taps a button and rests his hands in his lap. The small car begins to roll, navigating at a leisurely 7 kilometers per hour (4 mph) between buildings and parked vehicles.
"It can go faster — 20 to 25 kilometers per hour is no problem," the researcher from Augsburg University of Applied Sciences said while sitting in the driver's seat — only as a safeguard, he explained, ready to take over if something goes wrong.
Cameras, radar, so-called Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors and a high-performance computer keep the car on course. After a short loop, the vehicle brakes on its own at the destination, where a crowd waits to also get a first taste of autonomous driving.

The event was organized by NeMo (New Mobility) Paderborn, a coalition of 75 partners from academia and industry. Like several other consortia across the country, it hopes to help Germany claim a leadership role in the technology.
But the challenges are steep in Germany. High car ownership, a strong taxi lobby and a well-developed public transit network leave little room for newcomers to the mobility market. Many projects have fizzled out once government funding dried up.
The energy-efficient swarm
Germany has authorized Level 4 autonomy, which allows passengers to sleep, work or watch movies while traveling — provided vehicles operate on preapproved routes or under remote supervision.
But according to the German motorists' association ADAC, progress is slow partly because it is absolutely unthinkable for German manufacturers to go into series production with an immature system.
And so, while driverless taxis are already a common sight in parts of the United States and China, German deployments remain limited to shuttles and minibuses on fixed, local routes.
What will mobility look like in the future?

Several German towns and cities like Munich and Monheim are testing autonomous driving, and even though not a single accident has happened with such a car, conventional car drivers have reportedly been annoyed by their overly cautious driving style.
NeMo wants to change that. Its concept involves a "swarm" of lightweight autonomous cabs handling short trips and first-and-last-mile connections. For longer distances, the cars can couple automatically to an autonomous tractor unit, forming a convoy before separating near their destinations.
In late August, the first cabs were allowed to drive autonomously on airport grounds. The larger tractor vehicle is still under development, with the first commercial rollout expected in Paderborn by 2026.
Energy efficiency is the project's calling card. The cabs, designed for up to four passengers, are half the weight of a conventional car and carry only small batteries, limiting their range.
To compensate, the tractor unit will "recharge them on the move, powered by its own battery, hydrogen tank and fuel cell," said Thomas Tröster of Paderborn University, adding that traveling in the tractor unit's slipstream also reduces the cabs' energy consumption.
"We're not retrofitting existing cars for autonomy; we're building entirely new vehicles," Tröster told DW.
Rural mobility reimagined
Munich startup INYO is supplying the autonomous cars, while HOLON — a spinoff of German auto supplier Benteler — is developing the tractor units.
The service is designed to be cheaper than a taxi but not much more expensive than going by bus. "It depends on whether passengers are willing to accept waiting times, have luggage and whether they accept others joining during the ride," said Tröster. For example, a woman might want to book a vehicle for herself alone at night for an extra fee.
NeMo describes the model as "individualized public transit" — especially suited to rural areas where buses are infrequent.
Etteln, a village near Paderborn, is among them. In 2024, it was named the "world's smartest" by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the world's largest professional association for technical professionals in electrical and electronic engineering.

Speaking with DW, Etteln's mayor, Ulrich Ahle, said the community has been running a so-called e-village car service for five years, in which people can book rides via smartphone. A service for residents without a driver's license would be the "next logical step," he said, adding that the Etteln had already created a 3D digital twin of the village, where the autonomous cabs have begun driving virtually.


From pilots to mainstream
Elsewhere, Germany's biggest city experiments are moving faster. In Hamburg, transit operator Hochbahn is deploying about 20 autonomous vehicles in partnership with HOLON and Volkswagen subsidiary MOIA. The fleet will include minibuses for up to 15 passengers and Volkswagen (VW) electric cars for smaller groups.

Initially, safety drivers will be present, but the vehicles will operate without fixed routes or schedules. Test users will be able to book rides via an app within a densely populated 37-square-kilometer zone.
The Association of German Transport Companies (VDV) predicts the first regular Level 4 services could launch within five years. The vehicles are technically mature and legally permitted.
But it cautions that autonomous driving won't solve Germany's traffic and land-use problems if it simply replaces the country's 48 million private cars one-for-one. Instead, driverless fleets must be integrated into the public transit system, and scaling up will not come cheap. 
So, rather than continuing to finance temporary pilot projects, the industry group wants the German government to support a nationwide rollout. Only then, it argues, can the government live up to its pledge to become a global leader in autonomous mobility.

        <link href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/national-security-sale"/>
        <updated>2025-09-24T04:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Until recently, few policy tools united Democrats and Republicans like export controls. Restrictions on the spread of dual-use U.S. technology such as semiconductors became the policy of choice in the tech race against China and as a means of punishing Russia for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In the wrong hands, semiconductors and certain other U.S. technologies can present national security risks. Politicians might have debated the details, but there was broad bipartisan agreement that the U.S. government should regulate the movement of these technologies.
The Trump administration has also embraced the use of export controls—but it has added a twist. In August, the administration brokered a revenue-sharing deal with Nvidia, a U.S. company that designs semiconductor chips used to power artificial intelligence. In exchange for export control licenses to sell its H20 chip to China, the company will now give 15 percent of its revenue from those sales to the U.S. government. Previously, the U.S. government reviewed license applications to ensure transactions did not present unacceptable risks. This time, the administration replaced that process with a price tag, prioritizing side payments to the government over security interests.
Although Beijing banned Chinese companies from buying Nvidia’s chips last week, after accusing the company of violating antimonopoly laws, the Trump administration’s deal is part of a worrying trend: the monetization of national security. Instead of treating security as an indivisible, priceless ideal—similar to free and fair elections, free speech, or freedom of religion—the administration is treating U.S. national security as if it were a portfolio of divisible, priceable assets. What once was security is now securities. Worse, the prices appear to be negotiable: the president revealed in a press conference that the administration had sought a 20 percent cut of Nvidia’s sales but settled for 15.
Reducing national security to dollars and cents does not just distort the term’s meaning; it also makes the United States less secure. Replacing licenses with revenue-sharing deals, making certain types of direct investments, and squeezing U.S. allies and partners may all help fill U.S. government coffers. But policies designed to maximize short-term gain can create new security problems and leave the old ones unsolved. They will enable U.S. technology to more easily reach American adversaries, cost the U.S. government oversight over taxpayer money, and sacrifice Washington’s ability to shape the world around it.
Avoiding these dangers and reducing the U.S. economy’s exposure to risk requires a careful, farsighted strategy that recognizes the reality of the United States’ place in today’s world. True economic security will remain out of reach as long as the government is run as a business, its policy levers and relationships priced, bundled, and repriced, available to be bought and sold.
GETTING TO AGREEMENT
Economic concerns were fundamental to national security when the term was first introduced in national debate, about a century ago. As the historians Peter Roady and Andrew Preston have recently documented, during his 1932 election campaign and following presidential term, Franklin Roosevelt deliberately defined the phrase to capture risks to domestic economic well-being. In his second fireside chat in 1933, Roosevelt argued that economic struggle led to “incalculable” social harm and a “loss of that sense of security.” A new domestic economic program was “imperative to our national security,” he declared, later summarizing, “Freedom from fear is eternally linked with freedom from want.”


Roosevelt’s original interpretation of national security later gave way to a more militarized, more expansive conception, reinforced by the interests of a growing arms industry and the rise of the modern military-industrial complex. It came to encompass every corner of the world. This focus on military and ideological competition reigned supreme into the early years of the twenty-first century, even as Washington began paying greater attention to the financial tools it could use to contain threats from terrorist groups and rogue states after the 9/11 attacks.
In the 2010s and early 2020s, Roosevelt’s vision of the economic and domestic dimensions of national security made a bipartisan comeback. The second line of the Obama administration’s 2015 National Security Strategy affirmed that “America’s growing economic strength is the foundation of our national security.” In his first term, Trump championed the same idea. “For the first time,” he remarked on releasing his 2017 National Security Strategy, “American strategy recognizes that economic security is national security.”

 Reducing national security to dollars and cents makes the United States less secure.
Four years later, President Joe Biden’s 2021 interim national security guidance repeated the same mantra: “Economic security is national security.” Biden’s Department of Commerce played a greater role in national security policy than anyone in government could remember, not just with export controls but also in work on supply chains, cybersecurity, information and communication technology, climate change, investment security, law enforcement, commercial diplomacy, standards development, patents, domestic investment, and even commercial space policy. There was substantial bipartisan alignment on many of these issues. Republicans were especially supportive of the department’s export control policies, and in late 2023, Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis proposed establishing a federal office of economic security and competition—with a mandate similar to that of new offices the Biden administration had created earlier that year, including the Commerce Department’s Supply Chain Center and the Office of Economic Security and Emerging Technology, part of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
It is not simply that economic, technology, and trade policy became more appealing arrows in the national security quiver. That did happen. But more significantly, on a philosophical level, leading Democrats and Republicans agreed that security itself meant much more than an absence of physical attack. It also meant reducing economic struggle and risk. They saw economic security as a domestic issue as much as an international one. The erosion of strategic U.S. industries and the loss of technological leadership, for instance, could leave the United States vulnerable to foreign actors who might weaponize trade dependencies. The supply chain disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic showed just how easily the country could lose access to critical goods. The first Trump administration’s relentless focus on manufacturing domestically to rely less on others and its concern that Huawei and TikTok could give the Chinese government access to American data, furthermore, continued into the Biden administration. With notable exceptions, such as export controls, Democratic and Republican policy solutions were not always the same, but everyone largely agreed on what the problem was.
EVERYTHING HAS A PRICE
The second Trump administration is challenging this consensus. Traditionally, national security has been about reducing threats; now, the administration seeks to profit from them, ostensibly in the eventual hope of cutting taxes for the public benefit. The H20 chip deal with Nvidia is one way it has done this, by allowing a company whose business with China presents a national security threat to buy off that risk. Trump has said that H20 chips are “obsolete” products that China “already has,” suggesting that selling them presents no risk to the United States. The point is moot in this case if Beijing keeps a ban on Nvidia’s chips in place. But in principle, a riskless export control license is an oxymoron; licenses are required only when the government has identified a risk. It did so for the H20 chip just a few months ago, in April. This is the reason paying for export control licenses is prohibited under U.S. law (Title 50 of the U.S. Code), to prevent a situation in which financial gain takes precedence over national security concerns. When export controls are about money rather than security standards, U.S. technology will easily reach malign actors.


Possible legal complications, however, have not stopped the Trump administration from pursuing this kind of arrangement. It has already reached a deal with another technology company, AMD, to give the U.S. government 15 percent of its revenue from selling its MI308 processors in China—something Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (whose department does not oversee dual-use export controls) called a “beta test.”
The administration could continue to replicate this model, and not just in export control cases. It could, for example, try to generate cash for the federal government by accepting payment in exchange for the approval of foreign direct investment in U.S. companies, wiping away potential national security concerns for the right price. If an investment presents any kind of concern, such as data security, however, pretending the problem does not exist because someone has agreed to pay the government is not a real solution. And left unresolved, a national security problem will only fester.
The monetization of national security has not been limited to revenue-sharing deals. The administration is also exploring direct investment in U.S. companies. Most notably, the government announced in August that it was purchasing a ten percent stake (roughly $8.9 billion) in Intel, the United States’ largest semiconductor manufacturer. Unlike revenue-sharing deals, direct investment is unusual but not unprecedented. There can be legitimate reasons for the government to invest in a company that is critical to national security and needs help. For instance, a struggling company that faces closure or a foreign takeover might need both cash and strategic guidance. Or a startup that is not yet generating revenue may need public investment when private capital is not an option. But making money should not be the primary goal—a single company’s payouts to the government should not be prioritized above nationwide security interests.

 An action to resolve one risk should not create an even greater risk.
The Intel deal illustrates this risk. Federal money was already promised to Intel through grants from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act; this money came with protections attached to ensure it was used to advance the public interest. The largest grant supported manufacturing projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon, and the company was obligated to report on project milestones and follow national security guardrails that, among other things, limited its activities with foreign countries of concern. Also embedded in the grant program was a provision to return money to taxpayers in the case of unanticipated profits, called “upside sharing.”
But instead of continuing to disburse grant money and keeping these protections in place, the U.S. government opted for equity. This meant more cash up front for Intel and potentially more future revenue for the federal government but—critically—a significant loss of oversight of taxpayer dollars. Intel may decide to use those dollars in ways that support national security interests. Or it may not.
Finally, the administration has monetized national security through its approach to U.S. military support and foreign aid, helping others if it brings a financial return. “Taiwan should pay us for defense,” the then candidate Trump said in 2024. “You know, we’re no different than an insurance company.” Shortly after Trump’s election, Taiwan pledged to increase its spending on U.S. weapons; in the early months of his presidency, Trump’s frequent complaints about allied free-riding pressured others to do the same. The administration followed a similar mercenary logic in pursuing a critical minerals deal with Ukraine in exchange for Washington’s continued support for Kyiv’s war effort and in canceling U.S. foreign aid across the globe. To replace a “charity-based model” of development assistance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote in July, the administration would instead seek investment opportunities that produce “a multiplier effect” that benefits the private sector.
Yet likening aid to an insurance policy or a market venture misses the greatest strategic value of supporting others. Take development aid. Aside from the compelling morality of alleviating human suffering, this aid can provide a bulwark against foreign manipulation, the emergence of terrorist havens, the growth of black markets, and other security threats that arise from chronic underdevelopment and economic struggle. Those interests, like so many others—nuclear nonproliferation, maintaining robust alliances, supporting democracy—have little to do with immediate financial returns.
To call the Trump administration’s approach to national security transactionalism misses the bigger point. Transactionalism assumes an exchange, tit for tat. But the administration instead is trading an intangible for a tangible: security interests for cold, hard cash. In doing so, it betrays a fundamentally different view of what national security is—one that suggests security can be priced at all.
FIRST PRINCIPLES
At best, the administration’s pursuit of profit distracts Washington from solving national security concerns; at worst, it deepens those threats. Monetization can even create new vulnerabilities and sources of insecurity by incentivizing affluent players to join the game. Take, for instance, Qatar’s gift of a gleaming $400 million airplane to transport the U.S. president. In the administration’s eagerness to accept a golden egg, it has created a golden espionage opportunity by inviting foreign surveillance.


The core problem with monetizing national security interests is that it contradicts the basic principles of economic security. This subset of national security includes protecting the U.S. economy, critical infrastructure, and American well-being; building national resilience to disruptions; and generally ensuring the safe and stable flourishing of American society. Truly advancing economic security requires that policymakers navigate tradeoffs, recognize that other countries hold leverage, engage partners, and play the long game.
Maintaining a bird’s-eye view of tradeoffs and tensions in economic security policy is essential to making wise decisions. Economic actions taken on behalf of national security, such as export controls, could have the unintended effect of limiting economic growth and innovation. Likewise, some actions taken in the pursuit of economic growth and innovation, such as export promotion and scientific collaboration, may undermine national security if those exports and research products are used to threaten Americans. The pitfall to avoid is creating new sources of insecurity or areas of misunderstanding. An action to resolve one risk should not create an even greater risk. For instance, the Trump administration’s early approach to tariffs—massive, punitive, and blunt—roiled the market and created economic uncertainty that even the president could not stomach. More narrowly targeted trade arrangements would help minimize adverse effects on American consumers, producers, and investors. They would also ensure the clarity, transparency, and predictability that CEOs and U.S. allies and partners crave.

 A democratic government does not exist to enrich itself.
Successful economic security policies also appreciate balance-of-power politics. The United States does not exist in a unipolar world, controlling supply chains and economic chokepoints. The more it acts as if it does, such as through coercive tariffs, the more other countries will balance against it. Frustrations with U.S. tariff policies have already breathed new life into the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, an economic and security body that encompasses more than 40 percent of the world’s population and aspires to be a strategic counterweight to the United States’ presence in Asia. More balancing may follow suit.
A smarter approach would engage partners. This is not just about doing good; it is strategic. Building trusted supply chains, protecting data, and executing export controls, for instance, all rely on coordination with international partners and, perhaps more important, with industry. Without coordination, rules are weaker, evasion is easier, and law enforcement is harder. True cooperation is not a slipshod, made-for-TV deal. It is accomplished through regular, deliberative bureaucratic conversations and adherence to process. By genuinely seeking input from its partners, the United States can avoid the kind of harmful backlash to its policies that ultimately undermines U.S. influence.
Finally, policymakers must recognize that economic security is a long game. Economic tools such as export promotion to build trusted supply chains tend to take years to work. Yet many national security professionals mistakenly assume that they will see the same immediate results as decisive military action. This rarely happens; it is always easier to destroy than it is to build. Economic policy has the most to offer over the long term, in its potential to transform societies. This is what makes development aid—which the Trump administration has slashed as a supposed cost-saving measure—so valuable. Development, of course, cannot happen overnight. And it is not always clear what problem, or malign actor, the aid is warding off. But helping build a healthier and more prosperous world reduces the chances of many bad outcomes.
The United States’ security challenges are becoming only more complex, and policymakers are still figuring out how best to address them using the economic tools at their disposal. Yet one guiding principle is clear: a democratic government does not exist to enrich itself. National security policy, therefore, should not seek profits or involve opportunistic bonus payments. The U.S. government’s national security responsibility is to ensure national security. That is it.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[In August, five years after a fatal military clash between China and India, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi traveled to Tianjin to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. The visit marked Modi’s first trip to China since relations between the Asian neighbors soured in 2020. Western analysts were struck by images of Modi holding hands and laughing with Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Several observers feared that U.S. President Donald Trump’s tirades and tariffs—he imposed a 50 percent tariff rate on India over the summer—had pushed New Delhi into Beijing’s arms.
That assertion gets both cause and effect wrong. Modi’s meeting with Xi was neither a sudden response to Trump’s bullying nor a hurried reset of India’s relationship with China. And New Delhi is certainly not in Beijing’s arms, nor is it striving alongside Beijing and Moscow to establish a new anti-Western order. India has indeed been working with China for nearly a year to return some measure of stability to bilateral relations. Those efforts, however, don’t obviate the fact that the rivalry between the two Asian giants persists.
But Trump’s pressure on India and his seeming desire to arrive at some kind of grand bargain with China will invariably affect the calculus of Indian policymakers. With concern, they will see Washington’s coercive approach toward New Delhi and the contrasting gentler posture toward Beijing as a break from recent U.S. policy, which stressed the imperative of deterring China and helped drive the United States and India closer. Indian officials will not want to be left at such a disadvantage, and that alarm could increase the extent of India’s reengagement with China. That, in turn, will have implications for American interests in the region. If Trump continues to target India, it could lead to a situation in which India opts to cooperate less with and buy less from the United States and to potentially do more with China and others—the opposite of the Trump administration’s stated desire to strengthen ties with New Delhi.
COURTING A RIVAL
The thaw in what had been an icy Chinese-Indian relationship was first evident in October 2024 at the convening of the non-Western grouping known as BRICS, when Modi and Xi had a bilateral meeting for the first time since 2019. The two sides announced that they had completed troop disengagement at the border, a key step on the path to normalizing relations. Both Beijing and New Delhi were ready to change the temperature. China had been facing strategic and economic headwinds, including flagging growth, pressure from the United States, and concern in Europe about Chinese support for Russia. India, for its part, did not want to fret about the prospect of further clashes along the border and instead wanted to focus on boosting its economic growth and bolstering Indian capabilities for the larger competition with China. And at the time, neither side knew who would next occupy the White House and how it might affect U.S. policy toward China.
Since then, the frost between China and India has melted further. The countries revived border talks among their special representatives in December 2024, with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi traveling to New Delhi this August. On the multilateral front, despite Xi skipping the G-20 summit in India in 2023, India sent several senior officials, including its defense minister, external affairs minister, and national security adviser, to China for various meetings this year in support of Beijing’s presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.


These consultations have opened the door to additional conciliatory steps, including the revival of civil society exchanges, an agreement to restart direct flights between the two countries, India once again issuing visas for Chinese tourists, and China restoring access for Indians to the pilgrimage to Kailash Mansarovar, a sacred Hindu site in Chinese-held Tibet.
Perhaps more significant is the possibility of selective economic reengagement. In 2020, concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic and that year’s border clashes led New Delhi to impose restrictions on Chinese economic and technology-related activities in India. These included additional scrutiny of investments from China, the exclusion of Chinese companies from India’s 5G network, and the banning of Chinese apps such as TikTok. In the last couple of years, Indian firms, including some of the country’s largest conglomerates, have been calling for these restrictions to be eased. With the current thaw, the Indian government seems more receptive to this demand—and Trump’s tariffs could tip the scale in favor of those seeking to do more business with China.
If the situation along the border remains stable, New Delhi could ease some restrictions in nonsensitive areas. It would likely prioritize sectors where Chinese companies, industrial inputs, and expertise could help India grow or, ironically, help reduce its dependence on imports from China over the long term by building domestic capacity. Policymakers could permit Chinese involvement in areas where it could help create jobs, improve India’s manufacturing and technological capabilities, better integrate India into global supply chains, and boost Indian exports. New Delhi could condition this market access by requiring those Chinese companies seeking to do business in India to form a joint venture with a local company or provide technical assistance or to transfer technology to their Indian counterparts (much as Beijing has required of foreign firms seeking to do business in China). To be sure, India will likely continue to exclude Chinese entities from sensitive sectors, including critical physical and digital infrastructure such as telecommunications, strategic technologies such as space and nuclear energy, and those that would allow China to own or transfer vast quantities of data relating to Indian citizens.
There is a dilemma here for both countries. For New Delhi, repairing economic ties with China could contribute to economic growth but also lead to greater vulnerability and dependence. Beijing, for its part, wants access to the largest market in the global South as it seeks to diversify away from Western markets. But in the process, it could end up strengthening a strategic and economic competitor.
AT ARM’S LENGTH
This dilemma reflects the fact that, whatever they might say at summits, the two countries still see each other as rivals. And their differences persist. The Indian chief of defense staff recently reiterated that the unresolved border dispute with China remains India’s primary security challenge. Chinese and Indian troops have not gone back to their pre-2020 deployments. Beijing still wants to keep the border issue separate from the broader relationship, whereas New Delhi sees a stable border as the necessary basis for normal ties.
Other bilateral and regional problems also bedevil the relationship. India’s trade deficit with China has only increased in the last few years. And Beijing has demonstrated that it is willing to weaponize New Delhi’s dependence and to try to stymie India’s manufacturing and infrastructure ambitions: China restricted the export to India of rare-earth magnets and fertilizers in 2024 and 2025, the supply to India of tunnel-boring machines produced by a German company in a Chinese manufacturing facility, and the travel of technical experts from China to Apple’s partner factories in India. It has also announced a massive dam project on the Yarlung Tsangpo (which India calls the Brahmaputra River) that could adversely affect India and Bangladesh, which are downstream.
This year, in May, China also played a significant, albeit behind-the-scenes, role in major clashes between India and Pakistan. Beijing backed Islamabad with real-time intelligence and information operations; one former Indian ambassador to Beijing labeled China’s support “battlefield collusion.” China also continues to be Pakistan’s most consequential supplier of military equipment, including, most recently, another submarine.



 Whatever they might say at summits, China and India still see each other as rivals.
Thanks to these developments and to India’s long-simmering mistrust of China, New Delhi has not been as warm or as willing to accommodate China as Chinese officials might have hoped. Ahead of the Modi-Xi meeting, India declined to confirm China’s claim that Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar affirmed to Wang Yi during their August meeting that “Taiwan is part of China.” Instead, Indian officials insisted that they would maintain economic, technological, and cultural ties with Taiwan. An upset Beijing then declared this an attempt to “undermine China’s sovereignty on the Taiwan question and impede the improvement of China-India relations.” During the visit of Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr., in early August and Modi’s subsequent trip to Tokyo in late August, India also did not hold back in reiterating its position on the South China Sea and East China Sea, where Chinese maritime claims and military maneuvers have rankled neighboring states. Both of those diplomatic exchanges—and the first joint sail in the South China Sea by the Indian and Philippine navies—also indicate that India continues to seek to balance China by strengthening ties with other states in East Asia and Southeast Asia.
India has also been reluctant to support or join Chinese efforts to build an anti-Western bloc. Modi’s attendance at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit received considerable attention, but what he did not do drew less attention. He pointedly did not revive his trilateral meetings with the leaders of China and Russia, which were held regularly before 2019, despite Beijing and Moscow’s desire to do so. He did not attend Xi’s victory parade in Beijing. And he did not, unlike Xi and Putin, participate in Brazil’s emergency virtual BRICS summit to discuss U.S. tariffs, leaving that task to Jaishankar.
THE TRUMP EFFECT
India has little desire to cede ground or make substantial concessions to China. Two elements of Trump’s approach, however, are shaping the debate in India about the right balance in the country’s foreign relations—and could very well shape India’s choices. First, Trump is bluntly using the very partnership that previous administrations—including his own—have built as coercive leverage to pressure India to change both foreign and economic policy. Second, he has taken a more accommodating stance toward Xi and caused a great deal of uncertainty in India about the direction of U.S.-Chinese relations.
India moved to stabilize ties with China in 2024 in part because it did not know in which direction the next U.S. president would take the country’s China policy. The Trump administration’s tariffs against India—and the prospect of a Trump-Xi summit—only increased that impetus and the urgency as Modi headed into talks with Xi in Tianjin. But with Washington pressuring New Delhi and holding back on countering China, Modi found himself in a weaker position than he was in last year, when the Biden administration maintained a clear interest in partnering with India, in part to compete with China.

 Trump is weakening the hands of those in India who advocate for closer ties to the United States.
A U.S.-Chinese détente, even if temporary, would not only change the balance of leverage between India and China in negotiations but also complicate India’s strategic environment. If the current chill in India’s relations with the United States persists, India will face a scenario it has not experienced for a while: a fractious relationship with the United States while Washington pulls back from full-on strategic competition with Beijing and draws closer to Islamabad. Even though India is much stronger today than it was in the past, it fears that in such a scenario China would be tempted to press India harder—for instance, by attempting further incursions at the border. To avert that, there will be calls in India to hedge further with China even if it’s on suboptimal terms, such as by making certain economic concessions, holding back on cooperation with other partners that China might find threatening, or not standing up to instances of Chinese assertiveness along the border.
This is not just a hypothetical future concern. Trump’s approaches to China and India have already strengthened the hands of those in India making the case for greater openness to China. India’s largest corporations, for instance, are exploring joint ventures with Chinese companies and seeking more imports from China. Beyond the medium-to-long-term impact on who does business with India, such activity could eventually expand the constituencies in India that want greater accommodation with China.
At the same time, Trump is weakening the hands of those in India who advocate for closer ties to the United States. New Delhi’s and Washington’s shared interests in countering Beijing deepened their partnership. It incentivized both countries to overcome historical baggage, manage differences, and cooperate in unprecedented ways in terms of defense, economic security, and technology.


But today, critics of that cooperation in India are arguing that Trump does not seem interested in competition with China. Moreover, those critics argue, a United States that is weaponizing interdependence and trying to coerce India is behaving, well, just like China. Even supporters of the relationship, such as Jaishankar, note that India needs to guard against not just overdependence on sources of supply (notably, China) but also against sources of demand (notably, the United States). This reflects a shift: instead of being understood as part of the solution to India’s China problem, the United States is fast becoming perceived as a problem in its own right.
A LOSE-LOSE SITUATION
And if that perception holds—and policies follow from it—it will be a problem for the United States. Persisting tensions with the United States will affect India’s strategic, economic, and technology choices. Figures both within and outside the Indian government will urge leaders to do less with an unreliable United States and to find alternative security partners and markets, as well as sources of capital, defense equipment, technology, commodities, and know-how. This will make India a less friendly environment for American businesses and technology firms and a less willing partner for the U.S. government, particularly in the defense, economic security, and technology domains, where India had started cooperating with the United States in ways it had not before.
In their recent piece for Foreign Affairs, Kurt Campbell and Jake Sullivan made the case that American investment in India was not based on altruism but on interests, including the U.S. ability to compete with and deter China. Were India aligned with the United States, it would complicate China’s calculations. Were India and the United States at odds with each other, though, both countries would have a weaker hand to play, especially when it comes to China.
New Delhi realizes that it will have less leverage with Beijing and a tougher time securing itself, growing economically, innovating, and ensuring an Asia not dominated by China if U.S.-Indian ties remain fraught. This is why it continues to seek an agreement with the Trump administration. If Washington does not reciprocate and instead persists in pressuring India, however, New Delhi over time will find a different balance in its foreign policy, and that new balance will invariably be less favorable to the United States.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[When the US speaks, the world listens when it comes to health policy. Experts say the Trump administration's changes to vaccine and medicine recommendations in the US could undermine health messaging worldwide.

Recent changes to vaccine and medicine recommendations in the US could undermine health messaging in other countries, experts say.
In September, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) updated its recommendations for the combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine in children and COVID-19 vaccines for all US residents.
It also indefinitely deferred a decision changing recommendations for the hepatitis B vaccine in newborns, though US President Donald Trump said in an announcement from the White House on Monday that it should be administered to kids not before they are 12 years old. Current medical advice states that babies should be immunized against hepatitis B over the course of their first 18 months.
Trump and his health officials also changed recommendations for the common painkiller Tylenol (which has the same active ingredient, acetaminophen, as paracetamol) during pregnancy and early childhood. They cited a handful of studies showing an association — but not a causative relationship — between the drug and neurodevelopment changes, including autism and ADHD, in children.
Scientific consensus currently shows that an interplay of wide-ranging genetic and environmental factors probably lead to these developmental changes, rather than a single cause such as painkiller use in pregnancy.


New vaccine and drug recommendations in US
The ACIP has altered its recommendations for the MMRV and COVID-19 vaccines.
The combined MMRV vaccine was previously recommended for children younger than 4. It is now recommended that the MMR vaccine is delivered separately from the "V" jab for varicella, which protects against chickenpox. Figures reportedly presented at the meeting showed that 85% of US children already receive these shots separately. Children who get the combined MMRV vaccine have a slightly higher risk for fever-related seizures. On the other hand, when the shots are split up, children are not protected against all four diseases until they have been vaccinated against each of them, instead of after a single combined shot.
Declines in vaccine uptake in recent years have led to two-decade highs in US measles cases, and higher-than-usual numbers globally.
The Trump administration panel did not vote to recommend COVID-19 vaccines to the general public. But they did reject restrictions that would have required a prescription to receive a COVID-jab.
After Trump linked the painkiller Tylenol to autism, the updated recommendation from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said the drug, which is the only readily available painkiller approved for use in pregnancy, should only be administered following consultation with a medical professional.
A nuanced perspective
Trump said the hep B vaccine isn’t necessary for infants because the disease is sexually transmitted.
While it is true that hepatitis is most often transmitted by sexual activity, or from a mother to a developing fetus during pregnancy, there are other ways. Contaminated needles are one, another is the fecal-oral route, where mouth exposure to the virus in fecal matter can lead to infection.
This is also how polio is transmitted. Cases of the disease have increased in some communities where vaccination levels have dropped.
The conflict between political messages and established health advice has been lamented by many experts following the Trump administration's announcements.

Painkillers, pregnancy & autism

Even the Trump Administration senior health officials Jay Bhattacharya, Marty Makary and Mehmet Oz acknowledged that the connection between painkillers and autism is patchy in an op-ed in the magazine Politico.
"Despite the sharp rise in autism prevalence, there is no scientific consensus on what is causing rates to grow, and families have few effective tools to prevent or treat it," they wrote. "Acetaminophen should be used judiciously in pregnancy, and under medical supervision of an obstetrician, as a practical, prudent medical approach that balances risks and benefits."
Jörg Dötsch, director of the Clinic and Polyclinic for Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine at Uniklinik Köln in Germany, told DW that vigilance is critical given the inconsistencies playing out between government advice and scientific consensus.
"To my mind, it’s ... important to always refer to what the international scientific community has achieved with all its research attempts and perspectives," Dötsch said.

US changes could damage global trust
Though statements from some parts of the US government's health machine have acknowledged contradictory science, they don’t carry the same heft as televised announcements by the US president.
And, as the world’s top economy and center of medical developments, funding and drug manufacture, what the US says and does can affect perceptions abroad.
"What happens in Washington echoes in Lagos, Nairobi, Cape Town and other places," Charles Shey Wiysonge, a senior director at the South African Medical Research Council, told DW.
He said there was a risk that vaccine debates in the United States could undermine trust in health recommendations elsewhere.
Julie Leask, a social scientist specializing in immunization at the University of Sydney, sees the same risk in Australia.
"People are trying to make sense of all this noise coming out of the US. They want to do what’s best for their health and their children’s health. It’s sad that we’re now having to warn people to be so discerning about what they will hear from the current US government on vaccines," Leask said. "There is multipartisan support for vaccination in the vast majority of countries. They are well-served by experts on their National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups who look carefully at the evidence and are committed to vaccine safety."
Dötsch recommends that people consult with a trusted medical professional when it comes to health questions. That is particularly true, he says, amid an ongoing clash between medical scientists and non-medical groups opposing vaccines and other approved therapies.
"At the end of the day, everybody has to find somebody who [they] trust," Dötsch said. "That might, for instance, be the family doctor, the GP or the pediatrician that is treating a child, or a gynecologist that is supervising the pregnancy.
"If you’re endowed with anything that comes from another country or from another society ... I’d always recommend to get in touch with those people in who you trust, and to discuss the items with them."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[No German footballer has won the prize in nearly 30 years, but a new generation of players hopes to change that.
    As great a career as Toni Kroos had, he never managed to win the Ballon d'Or Image: Christian Charisius/dpa/picture alliance   
Nearly 30 years have passed since a German footballer last won the Ballon d'Or, the sport's most prestigious individual prize. In 1996, Matthias Sammer was awarded the trophy on the heels of a European Championship victory for his country and just several months before he would go on to win the Champions League title with his club, Borussia Dortmund.
Even before Sammer, German footballers had seen considerable Ballon d'Or success, particularly in the 1970s and early 80s. Legends Gerd Müller, Franz Beckenbauer, and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge all won the prize, with the latter two even winning it twice.
In the last few decades, German teams and their players have managed to stay front and center in world football — Bayern Munich have won the Champions League three times, while Germany won the FIFA World Cup in 2014. Players like Manuel Neuer, Toni Kroos and Thomas Müller have all been integral to the success of their respective clubs.
But the coveted Ballon d'Or has remained elusive for German footballers. The question is, why?


A lack of elite attackers?
For nearly 30 years, the Ballon d'Or has almost exclusively favored strikers and attacking players. All but three winners since Sammer have been forwards, with the most recent exception to the rule being Spanish defensive midfielder Rodri in 2024.
The unfortunate reality for Germany is that they haven't managed to keep up with other nations, or even their own history, in producing world-class attackers. When the country exited the group stages in back-to-back World Cups, a lack of elite attacking output may have been one of the biggest contributing factors.
Both Thomas Müller and Toni Kroos made their mark during this era, but in truth, the only Germans that came close to lifting the Ballon d'Or in the past three decades were two goalkeepers. Oliver Kahn and Manuel Neuer redefined the position itself, but both could finish no higher than third — Kahn in 2001 and 2002, and Neuer in 2014. That year, Neuer also won the Golden Glove for best goalkeeper at the World Cup, but missed out on winning best overall player to Lionel Messi, despite the Argentine losing the final. And it was Cristiano Ronaldo who would take home the Ballon d'Or.


Ronaldo and Messi era
The biggest hurdle for players of any nationality during this time period was indeed Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. The duo dominated on the field, and that was reflected in the Ballon d'Or.
From Ronaldo's first win in 2008 to Messi's win in 2023, every year but two saw the Ballon d'Or given to these prolific footballers. When Croatian midfielder Luka Modric broke the 10-year streak in 2018, it at first seemed to signal the era was over. But immediately after, Messi would win the next two years in a row, and again in 2023.
Can Germany turn it around?
In the last two years, neither Messi or Ronaldo have been in the Ballon d'Or final three for the first time since 2006. A new era may now be truly arriving, and with it comes the perfect opportunity for Germany.
Two of the most exciting German players right now are Bayern Munich's Jamal Musiala and Liverpool's Florian Wirtz. Both are just 22 years old, play in attacking positions and are Champions League regulars. If Musiala can return to the form he showed before his injury and Wirtz can quickly adjust to life in the Premier League, there is a real chance that Germany will soon have a Ballon d'Or winner for the first time in two generations.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Critics say the president's plan to charge $100,000 application fees for the H-1B visa program will greatly stifle the US economy. Universities, nonprofits and tech startups stand to be most affected.

US President Donald Trump's proposal on Friday to begin charging a $100,000 (€85,000) application fee for the H-1B visa for highly skilled foreign workers has left the country's tech sector and universities scrambling to figure out the implications.
The announcement came in a so-called proclamation claiming that H-1B visas have been "deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor" and that "systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security."
Since its introduction in 1990, the H-1B visa program has been mostly used to provide the tech industry with highly skilled foreign workers. There is a limit to the amount of H-1Bs made available each year.

The current limit is 65,000, with an additional 20,000 for nonresidents who graduate with a master's degree or higher from a US institution.
People in "computer-related" occupations currently account for about two-thirds of visa holders.
Immediate implications for the US economy
Michael A. Clemens, professor of economics at George Mason University in the US state of Virginia, told DW that the announcement has caused "extreme chaos" and many aspects, including its legality, remain uncertain.
"People are still figuring out what this extraordinarily hasty and shock policy announcement even means," Clemens said. "The best interpretation, I think, that we have now is that it is a $100,000 per person payment that applies to at least a new initial employment."
The initial Trump statement did not clarify if the fee would apply each time a current visa holder reenters the United States or if it applies to renewals or existing holders.
Although White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has since said the fee would be a one-time application fee only that does not apply to current holders, those comments appear at odds with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who said last week that the fee would be applied annually.


Regardless of the exact terms, there is considerable dismay over the immediate implications among economists.
Clemens said the potential loss of talent would be a "tremendous economic loss" to the US economy. 
Jeremy Robbins, executive director of the nonpartisan American Immigration Council, told DW that he expects to see large multinational companies immediately move operations to other locations if the plan comes into effect.
"We're going to see it dramatically handicap our ability in key economic and national security industries like artificial intelligence and quantum computing," Robbins said. "A lot of the talented individuals around the world who want to come here and innovate start looking for somewhere else to go," he added.


Who will be most affected?
Clemens said universities and nonprofit organizations currently accounted for more than one-third of H-1B visas and they would largely be unable to pay such high fees to hire the necessary workers.
This would mean a "massive hit to the ability of any university to hire foreign faculty to attract the best and brightest researchers" and an "obliteration of any nongovernmental organization's ability to hire such people."
Other critics have underscored the detrimental impact on startups and smaller tech firms.
Garry Tan, chief executive of startup incubator Y Combinator, wrote on the messaging platform X that the decision "kneecaps startups." 
"In the middle of an AI arms race, we're telling builders to build elsewhere. We need American Little Tech to win, not $100K tollbooths," he said.
Clemens said it would be "all but impossible" for smaller startups to hire the necessary people if they had to pay such fees. "It will devastate their prospects," he added.

Huge Silicon Valley companies such as Meta, Google and Amazon are among the biggest H-1B users, relying on the program to provide scientists and engineers. Their massive revenues mean they could likely pay the fees anyway, but could also seek exemptions.

Is there any legitimacy to Trump's claims?
The White House claims that the H-1B system is being abused and that it disadvantages US workers.
Robbins said the system was in need of reform, pointing out that it was designed in the late 1980s and needs to be upgraded for the modern economy, with attention given to exactly how firms use it and from which sectors.
He said protections for American workers were "probably not where they need to be."
"That's why I think certain organizations like ours have been hugely in favor of reforming the H-1B system, of making sure that it is something about attracting talent and not about finding cheaper workers," he said.
He added, however, that even in its "broken state," studies consistently prove how much the visa system "creates jobs, drives innovation and contributes dramatically to the gross domestic product."
Robbins said US tech workers were "not being disadvantaged by the program" because unemployment among high-skilled US tech workers has been "dramatically low, in the 2% range for much of the last 10, 15 years." 
Clemens said abuse of the program was "a reality," but added that there are already regulations in place to deal with this.
As the US Department of Labor "investigates frequently" the firms' compliance with the rules of the program, Clemens said, it "does find violations." 
"That's certainly a case for enforcing the law and prosecuting violations, but taking the entire class of immigrants and imposing on all of them an astronomical penalty has nothing to do with that," he said.
What are the long term consequences?
As companies, universities, nonprofits and other users of the H-1B visa program try to figure out the next steps, the experts agree that, if the Trump administration proceeds with its $100,000 application fee, it will damage US economic innovation in the long term.
Clemens said "decades of extremely rigorous, peer-reviewed studies" on the effects of H1B workers "consistently point to one result: benefits for the local economy."
"Wherever they go, they cause more patenting, they cause the formation of more high-growth, venture capital-backed startup firms and they dynamize local economies," he said.
And Jeremy Robbins said one of the US's "greatest strengths" was that the country is "a place where more talented people around the world want to come than any other," adding that it would be a "very risky proposition to put that in jeopardy."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Authors Jamaica Kincaid, Elizabeth Kolbert and William Hitchcock discussed Trump's attacks on free speech and democracy at Berlin's literature festival.

How free do authors living in the United States feel during Donald Trump's second presidential term?
The question opened a discussion at Berlin's international literature festival: The talk, titled "The US Under Trump 2.0.," brought together three renowned authors — Jamaica Kincaid, Elizabeth Kolbert and William Hitchcock — who are among the 2025-26 Class of Fellows of the American Academy in Berlin.
"I should be the freest person in America — a 60-year-old white man with tenure at a university. Nobody can touch me," said historian William Hitchcock, ironically referring to his societal privilege. "But actually, that's not true anymore. So all of the things that we once knew and took for granted have been destabilized."

'Everyone is on edge'
The discussion was held a day after late night TV host Jimmy Kimmel was "indefinitely" suspended from his talk show following a joke related to Charlie Kirk's murderer — though the show was reinstated a few days later following a major public and political backlash. 
The censorship of Kimmel intensified concerns about the state of freedom of speech in the US.

"Now, words are being examined, and created, and evaluated, in a way I don't think I've ever experienced," said Hitchcock, whose podcast "Democracy in Danger" wasn't renewed in 2024, after four years of production.
"The university decided they didn't want to fund our podcast anymore, which gives you an idea of the way in which things slowly close around you," he explained.
If the program had continued, Hitchcock predicted that he would be more careful with his words: "Honestly, I'm not sure if I would feel as free to 'let it rip' on my podcast as I did a couple of years ago."
"All journalists, all news organizations are very worried," said Pulitzer Prize-winning author Elizabeth Kolbert, who is also a staff writer at The New Yorker magazine.
The Trump administration is filing a series of lawsuits against media companies. Among others, he's claiming $15 billion (€12.7 billion) from the New York Times and Penguin Random House, and $10 billion from the Wall Street Journal, for reports allegedly damaging his reputation.

The companies have dismissed the lawsuits, saying they lack legitimacy. The New York Times said in a statement that the claims are merely attempts "to stifle and discourage independent reporting."
Trump's defamation lawsuit against the newspaper was struck down by a federal judge on Friday for being unnecessarily long. But the president's legal team still plans to file an amended version of the case.
As Kolbert pointed out: "It just costs a lot of money to defend yourself against a suit like that, so everyone is on edge, and everyone is trying to be super careful."
"The violations of laws, the violations of civil rights are very familiar to African Americans," noted Antiguan-American novelist Jamaica Kincaid, who is also professor emerita of African and African American Studies at Harvard University.
"So this actually might be one of those transforming moments — a profound transforming moment in American life, where people who are not Black, but liberal, will become 'Black,'" she said at the Berlin event.

'Racism' underlies the 'Trump mystery'
The host of the discussion, Beatrice Fassbender, asked Elizabeth Kolbert, who specializes in environmental journalism, how a majority of US adults — around 70-72% according to recent polls — can believe that global warming is happening, and yet still vote for Trump, an avowed climate science denier.  
"It's one of the great mysteries of Donald Trump," said the author of the Pulitzer-prize winning non-fiction work, "The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History."
The mystery applies to a number of issues, she added, citing for example how 63% of US adults believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Yet even if it was widely known that a second Trump term would llikely lead to more restrictions on reproductive rights, a majority still voted for him.
The three authors discussed the role of money in the campaign, and how, for Kolbert, the economy and immigration becamee the "hot button issues."

But for Hitchcock, the constant talk about inflation and the price of eggs or gas during the campaign was "one of the biggest political shenanigans that's been pulled in a long time," as it was actually "masking a really profound ideology": racism.
"Racism is central to what's happening in America, and it's not new, but it has been accelerated in a way that is extraordinarily powerful and extraordinarily dangerous," said Hitchcock.
"There's no other way to fundamentally explain how Donald Trump can have a different point of view than pretty much all of his supporters, and yet they still are loyal to him without the one constant threat that they all share — which is a fundamentally racist view of the world."
"This is the American burden. It's 400 years old. It's central to our our whole national experience. If you're not focusing on that, you're not really talking about American political life," said the historian.


Is Trump 2.0 actually fascism?
The host of the discussion asked Hitchcock if he agreed with his fellow historian, Timothy Snyder, who has stated that Trump is a fascist. Other experts, however, are more reluctant to use the label.
"Fascism is a perfectly good word," said Hitchcock at the Berlin literature festival. "[But] whether you want to call it fascism or not, it kind of doesn't matter." 
The key, he added, is rather to identify the indicators of an authoritarian ideology at work: Is there a mass political movement backing it? Does it emphasize a nation in jeopardy and nationalism as its core ideology? Is it led by a charismatic leader "who can do no wrong"? Is it co-opting the institutions of the state? Is it anti-science and anti-university? Is it seeking to transform a liberal democracy into a one party state by repressing voting? This all checks under Trump's second administration, said Hitchcock.
"So if it walks like a duck, you have to start asking yourself: Maybe it is."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The Bundestag was to elect three new judges to Germany's highest court in July. But the vote was canceled because right-wing lawmakers took issue with one of the candidates. In September, the vote was successful.

The German parliament failed to complete one of its more important constitutional tasks before it went into summer recess in July. A planned vote to fill three vacancies at the Constitutional Court was removed from the agenda at short notice after it became apparent that one of the candidates, jurist and professor Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf, would not receive enough votes because of a lack of support from conservatives in the ruling bloc.
The governing parties — the ruling center-right bloc of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU)and Christian Social Union (CSU) and their junior partner, the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) — do not command a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag. To put together the two-thirds majority required for the appointment of judges, support from the opposition is needed. 
This was not supposed to have been a problem, as the opposition Greens and the Left Party had signaled that they would vote for Brosius-Gersdorf, who had been nominated by the SPD. But then it emerged at the last minute that more than twenty CDU lawmakers would not support her  — especially because of her liberal stance on abortion. 
The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), the second biggest faction in the parliament, had already made clear they were vehemently opposed to her nomination — unsurprisingly, as she had also suggested she would be in favor of banning the party if the necessary legal requirements were fulfilled.

AfD: 'This judge is unacceptable'
A few hours before the planned vote, the CDU demanded that the SPD withdraw Brosius-Gersdorf's nomination, citing new allegations that she might have plagiarized her PhD dissertation in 1997, which were later dismissed.


The Bundestag session was interrupted and, after crisis talks, the Bundestag voted to postpone all three scheduled elections. The CDU/CSU parliamentary group leader, Jens Spahn, was left looking bad, as he had failed to anticipate the level of opposition to the candidate and did not manage to rally the troops.
Heidi Reichinnek, head of the socialist Left Party parliamentary group, blamed the CDU for the parliamentary impasse: "You are playing party political power games here and once again causing absolute chaos." The leader of the Green Party, Britta Hasselmann, shared this view: "Today is a bad day for parliament, for democracy, and for the Federal Constitutional Court."

The judicial pillar of the German state
The Federal Constitutional Court is one of Germany's five organs of state. The other four are the lower house of parliament (Bundestag), the upper house of parliament (Bundesrat), which represents the state governments, the president, and the federal government. Together, they ensure the separation of powers, one of the core principles of a democratic society.
The Constitutional Court's role in this system is to safeguard Germany's constitution, known as the Basic Law. Half of the 16 judges are elected by the Bundestag, while the Bundesrat elects the other half. A two-thirds majority is required in each case. If this is achieved, the federal president officially appoints the successful candidates as new members of the court.
The state institutions are closely entwined in this election, which is why the parties represented in parliament, who nominate candidates for the court, are particularly dependent on coordination.

Crisis mode in governing coalition
In August, Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf withdrew her application.
"Parts of the CDU/CSU have categorically rejected my election," she wrote in a statement, adding that she didn't want the election process to widen the rift in the coalition and lead to developments with unknown impacts on democracy.
She also said that the SPD had stood by her "to the end" and said she had received "great support" from the Greens and the Left Party.
The failed vote marred the final session of parliament before the summer recess. Since then, the parliamentary group leaders of the CDU, CSU and SPD have been keen to demonstrate unity.
In September, the SPD named 51-year-old judge Sigrid Emmenegger as a candidate for the constitutional court. She has the backing of the Judicial Appointments Committee, as do the other two candidates: SPD-appointed Ann-Katrin Kaufhold and CDU/CSU-appointed Günter Spinner.
The vote in the Bundestag is scheduled for Thursday, September 25, and is widely expected to yield the necessary majority.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[As demand for nickel grows, plants could help suck out vital raw materials from soil. Could this replace conventional mining that's harmful to the environment?
    Farm workers in Tropoje, Albania are harvesting plants full of nickel Image: Metalplant   
On a field in northern Albania, farmers are working between rows of yellow mustard plants, bringing in their harvest: nickel.
What's planted here is one of about 700 hyperaccumulating species — plants that accumulate high amounts of metals from the ground, such as nickel, zinc, copper, even gold and rare earth elements.
They evolved to store these metals in their shoots, leaves or sap. It's their little toxic trick, a defense against predators and pathogens. For the plants themselves, the metals are harmless.
Nature's trick: some species are able to store metals to fight against predators and pathogensImage: Antony van der Ent

From cleaning up contaminated soil to mining metals
Scientists first used such plants in the 1980s to clean up soils that had been contaminated by mines or smelters. One plant was even able to remove small amounts of radioactive cesium from the soil of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site.
But it wasn't until the 1990s that the scientists asked: what if we used all those precious metals collected by the plants? They called the idea: phytomining.
Fast forward 30 years, and planting flowers to actually "mine" metals is on the brink of becoming a business. But can this really take on huge industrial mines?
Phytomining as a business model
On the field in Albania, there is too much nickel in the soil to grow food crops with good harvest. But then there's also not enough nickel to set up a conventional mine. This makes it an ideal place for phytomining, according to Eric Matzner, co-founder of startup Metalplant, which is behind the 10-hectare field near the town of Tropoje.
"The minimum target we are looking for is around a third of a ton of nickel per hectare," he said.


The Odontarrhena plants suck up the metal and store it. Once harvested and dried, about 2% of their dry weight is nickel. Metalplant grind and burn the plants, leaving an ashy concentrate, or "bio-ore." The ash gets washed and, by using sulfuric acid, turned into a liquid. It's then filtered and crystallized into nickel sulfate, a resource that is in high demand for use in large batteries, like those in electric cars.


Toxic tailings and waste in conventional mining
"The environmental impact of phytomining is low," said Antony van der Ent. A researcher with Wageningen University in the Netherlands, he is one of the world's busiest phytomining researchers and adviser to Botanickel, another company in the field.
Conventional metal mining can severely harm the environment, and often involves deforestation of large areas of land. It may produce toxic tailings and waste that can leak into the environment and poison people and wildlife. Because of the energy-intensive processing, it often comes with high greenhouse gas emissions. With 10 to 59 tons of emissions per ton of metal, nickel is especially polluting.

Phytomining, on the other hand, is climate-friendly. "A tremendous amount of carbon is captured by the metal crop. It is released back into the atmosphere during incineration of the plants, but that means you obtain highly pure nickel at close to zero carbon emission," said van der Ent.
Phytomining also targets land that lies barren and is deemed unsuitable for agriculture because of the metals in the ground.
"This land is being cleaned from the metals in the soil. Afterwards, it could probably be used for forestry or for recreational purposes," said Rupali Datta, a biochemist with Michigan Tech University who's done extensive research on phytomining.
World hunger for EV batteries fuels nickel demand
While plants are able to suck out different types of metal, scientists and companies have been applying phytomining almost exclusively to nickel harvesting: The metal is known to be abundant in the topsoil in many parts of the world, in countries like Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil, South Africa, or the US.


Meanwhile, demand for nickel is set to grow rapidly, according to the International Energy Agency, expected to double by 2050 fueled by the global hunger for EV batteries. However, most of the supply comes from Chinese-owned mines in Indonesia where concentrations in soils are high. Phytomining could serve as an alternative in countries with lower nickel contents, helping them to secure their own supply.
Is phytomining worth it?
Strategic research firm BloombergNEF estimated that phytomining would be too expensive for buyers of nickel. Metalplant wouldn't disclose how much it cost them to harvest the metal, but say they aim to match the price of any other nickel on the market.

"The goal is to get demonstrations of the price parity. We call it a green advantage or green dividend where you get a better product for equally the same cost," said Metalplant's Matzner. The startup also combines farming with carbon capture, for which they can sell carbon credits, to make it worth their while.
In their now third season, Metalplant said they harvested more than three tons of nickel on their 10-hectare field in Albania. That is what scientists elsewhere hope to achieve, too. But it pales in comparison to conventional mines where the same amount is being extracted in just about half an hour. 
Can phytomining replace conventional mines?
To match the annual output of one conventional nickel mine, a field would need to be the size of about 200,000 hectares. That's 2.5 times the size of New York City. To replace the current global conventional nickel production entirely, 15 million hectares of fields would be needed — an area the size of Tunisia.
"Economies of scale really play a key role," said Kwasi Ampofo, a metals market analyst at BloombergNEF. "The bigger it gets, the cheaper it gets. But for phytomining, the challenge hasn't been the cost. It has been land."
"Phytomining can definitely not replace conventional mining. It can be an additional process," biochemist Datta told DW. And monoculture fields at the scale of thousands of hectares would not be so environmentally friendly after all. "Wherever you're doing intensive farming, you're using fertilizer, pesticides, water — all of these are also applicable for phytomining," said Datta. 
According to researcher van der Ent, smaller communities struggling to grow food crops stand the most to gain from this type of mining. "That's where I see the potential," he said, adding that locals could turn a small profit from selling nickel while cleaning up their soil.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[For Ousmane Dembele it was his first Ballon d'Or, while Aitana Bonmati made history.

With 35 goals and 16 assists, Champions League winner Ousmane Dembele was the overwhelming favorite going into Monday evening's award ceremony in Paris. The 28-year-old played a key role in his club's historic treble season, including delivering two assists in Paris Saint-Germain's 5-0 trouncing of Inter Milan in the Champions League final in Munich last May.
"I didn't want to cry, but as soon as I started talking about my family, about the people who have been there for me, it came up and I couldn't hold it back," Dembele told Reuters afterwards.
The former Dortmund player was able to attend the awards ceremony in Paris even though PSG were playing Marseille on Monday night because of a hamstring injury. He was overwhelmed with emotion when presented with the trophy, and brought his mother onto the stage to enjoy the moment together. Barcelona's young star Lamine Yamal finished second but also won the award for the best U21 player of the year.


Bonmati makes history
In the women's game, Aitana Bonmati of Barcelona became the first woman to take home the Ballon d'Or Feminin for the third time in a row.
"It's incredible this feeling. I never thought when I was a kid that I could achieve this because I didn't think women's football can exist," Bonmati said.
Bonmati led Barcelona to the domestic treble and Spain to the Euro 2025 final, where, despite recovering from meningitis, she was named Player of the Tournament.

England stars such as Alessia Russo and Chloe Kelly, who had won Euro 2025 and the Champions League with Arsenal against Bonmati's Barcelona, had been considered favorites.
Kelly finished fifth, Russo third, while Arsenal teammate and Spanish midfielder Mariona Caldentey landed in second. Arsenal were also honored as the best women's team of the year.


German players go home empty-handed
The evening was disappointing for the German nominees. Florian Wirtz, who was named German footballer of the year in August, was the only German on the shortlist, finishing 29th. Harry Kane (Bayern Munich) was named best Bundesliga player in 13th place.
Former Germany coach Hansi Flick, now at Barcelona, lost out to PSG coach Luis Enrique in the Coach of the Year vote. National goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger (Gotham FC) also failed to win an award, being honored as the second-best goalkeeper in the inaugural Women's Yashin Trophy – the prize went to England's Hannah Hampton of Chelsea.

Winger Klara Bühl of Bayern Munich was the only German woman among the 30 nominees, finishing 19th. The award for Best Female Coach went to England's Sarina Wiegman, who defended the Euro title with the Lionesses.
Highest individual honor
The Ballon d'Or is an annual award given to the world's best football player. The French magazine France Football has been awarding the prize since 1956 (the women's since 2018).
The selection is based on the players' performances in the respective calendar year, with an international jury of journalists voting. The Ballon d'Or is considered one of the most important individual honors in football.
Unlike the FIFA World Player of the Year, which also includes votes from national coaches and captains, the Ballon d'Or is voted on exclusively by journalists.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Donald Trump claims to have the "answer to autism." On Monday, the US president claimed that a popular painkiller increases the risk of autism. Researchers say it doesn't work like that.

Complex questions generally have complex answers — such as the question of what causes autism. Experts in the field have debated the topic for decades. Now, US President Donald Trump claims to have solved the mystery. 
The US Department of Health and Human Services launched a "massive testing and research effort" to determine "what has caused the autism epidemic" by September, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in April. 
The number of people diagnosed with autism in the United States has been rising for decades. About one in 36 children were identified with autism spectrum disorder in 2020. That's up from one in 150 children in 2000, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
At Sunday's memorial service for right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, who was shot and killed on September 10, Trump teased an "amazing" announcement forthcoming regarding autism spectrum disorder.
"I think we found an answer to autism," Trump said.

At an announcement from the White House on Monday, the president blamed the painkiller Tylenol for high autism rates.
"Taking Tylenol is not good — I'll say it: It's not good," Trump said. He and Health Secretary Kennedy said they advised pregnant women not to take Tylenol, and would also give a recommendation to this effect to doctors. 
According to the government, people who take Tylenol during pregnancy have a significantly increased risk of giving birth to a child with autism spectrum disorder. Tylenol is available over the counter in the US; its active ingredient, acetaminophen, is chemically identical to popular European painkiller paracetamol. 
From a scientific point of view however, focusing on one active ingredient as the cause of autism isn't tenable. Extensive studies have shown no causal effect, only a minimal increase in risk, according to Christine M. Freitag, director of the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy at Frankfurt University Hospital. 

Researchers: One ingredient in medication doesn't cause autism
Taking painkillers during pregnancy is generally considered a risk. But all neural developmental disorders, including autism, are linked to polygenetic risks, according to Freitag. In other words, neither a single active ingredient in medication, nor individual genes are responsible.
Hundreds to thousands of gene variants are likely to play a role. People who carry a single gene variant from that group have a minimal risk of developing autism. Only when these variants accumulate does the risk increase.
Researchers have also repeatedly pointed out that, in addition to hereditary gene mutations, environmental effects such as pollutants, fine dust, microplastics or environmental toxins might also increase the risk of autism.
With scientists having spent decades researching the genetic and neuroscientific causes of autism, "the idea that we can suddenly find the causes by September is unrealistic," Geoff Bird, a cognitive neuroscientist and autism expert at University of Oxford and University College London, told DW in April.


What causes autism?
There are many different signs of autism, and people don't necessarily experience it in the same way . For some, social communication can be challenging or even overwhelming. Others might have difficulties with learning or hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli like touch or light.
As described in medical texts, autism spectrum disorder arises from alterations in the brain's development during early life. Research has shown that in people with autism, there can be a wide range of changes in how the brain functions. 
Scientists are "very sure there is a genetic basis," Bird said. About 80% of autism cases can be linked to inherited gene mutations. 
Changes in genes such as MECP2 have been found to alter brain development, but the evidence that specific changes are directly linked to autism isn't clear.
"Diagnosis of autism has always been the biggest challenge in autism research, because we don't have a biological marker of autism," Bird said. He added that this has created challenges for researchers in trying to understand the biological causes of autism.

Autism awareness and broader diagnostics
Experts say the biggest reason why diagnoses of autism have increased is that clinical and social definitions have changed frequently since autism was first described 80 years ago. 
"Now it's common to diagnose people with much more subtle difficulties, so that explains some of the increased prevalence," said Bird.
Changes in screening methods have also helped experts catch signs of autism in girls more often.
"Autism was mostly defined by how it presents in boys, and girls' diagnoses were fit to that. Now we are expanding what counts to meet diagnostic criteria for autism to account for female representations," said Bird. "The natural consequence is that autism prevalence increases."
The neurodiversity movement has also contributed to broader diagnostic criteria. Autism awareness movements have helped people understand how their own experiences might not be neurotypical. 
"Awareness has likely increased folk seeking an assessment and diagnosis, and so [they] can feel relief when they find answers and potential next steps," said Suzy Yardley, CEO of Child Autism UK, a nonprofit organization. 
Scientists are also investigating whether factors like pollutants, changes in the gut-brain axis or the immune system might have a direct effect on neurodevelopment and autism.
However, Bird said the evidence around these theories is "not convincing".
"No doubt pollutants do bad things, but I would be surprised if they were increasing rates of autism," he said.

Vaccines do not cause autism
The claim that vaccines are behind rising rates of autism has been repeatedly and vigorously disproved. 
Over the past two decades, scientists have carried out many large-scale and rigorous studies to determine whether any aspect of vaccination could cause autism. None showed any links whatsoever between autism and vaccines given either during pregnancy or after birth.
"No link has been found between autism and vaccines, including those containing thimerosal, a mercury-based compound," according to the US-based National Institutes of Health (NIH).
The false claim that vaccines cause autism originally came from a paper published in 1998 suggesting a link between the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and problems with brain development.
Later, the study was found to have serious errors and was retracted. Yet the damage done by the paper lives on.
Kennedy's history of anti-vaccine advocacy is well-documented. And in early 2025, he told the CDC to study the links between vaccines and autism, despite the agency's own previous research showing no link.
The HHS secretary also downplayed a measles outbreak in Texas that infected 500 people and killed two unvaccinated children.
Autism community advocates skeptical of Kennedy's goals 
Advocates for the autism community met the HHS secretary's announcement with skepticism. The UK's National Autistic Society called Kennedy's claim a "fake news publicity stunt."
"We're stunned by the callous and anti-science way autistic people are talked about by Trump and RFK Jr." said Tim Nicholls, assistant director of policy, research and strategy at the UK's National Autistic Society, in April. "Wouldn't it be better if they could deploy their huge financial resources to making life better for autistic people and their families, and improving society's understanding of autism?"
Bird said "tensions" in the way people think about and research autism are common, particularly when it comes to the idea of reducing it or wiping it out. Some advocacy groups argue that autism is not an illness, and "therefore there is not anything to 'cure'," Yardley told DW.
But others argue that those who argue autism isn't a disorder "outweigh the voices of a large number of people with autism who feel their lives have been negatively affected by having autism," Bird said.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The writer's Algerian civil war novel, "Houris," challenges taboos and gives women a voice. The book has made him famous — but also led Algeria to seek his arrest.

Kamel Daoud arrives for his interview in Berlin in a black limousine, accompanied by two men dressed in black who never leave his side. The Algerian writer, who now lives in France, is under police protection: His latest book not only won him France's most prestigious literary prize, the Prix Goncourt — it has also put him in grave danger.
"Houris," which has now appeared in German, is a novel that recounts the massacres and torture that took place during the Algerian civil war. Not only is it taboo to discuss the war in Algeria, but in 2005 a law was passed forbidding it — ostensibly to promote "national reconciliation."
"When you write a novel like this, you make enemies of Islamists, the regime and even intellectuals from the extreme left-wing decolonial movement," said Daoud. "You don't please anyone. A 17-year-old idiot with something to prove can be as much of a threat as the regime."
"Houris" has been banned in Algeria — in fact, all of Daoud's books have been removed from stores. Algerian authorities have issued two international arrest warrants against him, but the global police organization Interpol did not accept them.

Additionally, a woman has filed a civil lawsuit against the writer, accusing him of basing the central character on her own story without permission. Daoud claims this is defamation, and alleges that the legal action was orchestrated by the regime.
While the war of liberation against French colonial rule (1954-62) still shapes Algerian identity today, the government in Algiers is doing everything in its power to ensure people forget the civil war of the 1990s.
At that time, the national army and Islamist terrorist groups engaged in bloody fighting. Since then, much has remained in the dark, even the number of fatalities, which is usually estimated at around 200,000. As for the suffering of individual victims, this is rarely mentioned.

Silence about victims and perpetrators 
Daoud wrote about the war as a reporter. "But there are things you can't write about, things that stay in your head. When you write a report about a massacre with 400 victims, 400 is just a number. But how do you convey the feeling of stepping over dead bodies?" he said.

The novel "Houris" presents a different perspective. The narrator is a young woman who survived a massacre as a little girl. Her throat was cut, but she was saved.
Daoud was adamant that his novel's main protagonist should be a woman, since they are the ones who pay the highest price in war.
"Men are forgiven — or not," he told DW. "But what about women who were kidnapped by Islamists when they were 13 or 14 years old, who were raped and became pregnant? After the war, the men came back, but the women came back with their children. And no one forgives them for that."
The central character, Aube, does not get pregnant until after the war. But people still can't forgive her. Algerian society wants to erase all memories of what it calls the "Black Decade," and sees the visible scar on Aube's neck as a provocation.


'I am a feminist'
The fragile yet defiant young woman is only able to breathe through a tube in her throat. In an inner monologue, Aube talks to her unborn child about the atrocity itself and what happened afterwards.
Meanwhile, she runs a beauty salon right across the road from a mosque. It's a small slice of freedom where her female clients can enjoy beauty treatments as the neighboring imam delivers misogynistic sermons to their husbands.

The novel's title, "Houris," alludes to the virgins said to await righteous male Muslims in paradise.
Aube calls her unborn child "My Houri," but questions whether the child should even be allowed to live: The past is too painful, the present too hostile — especially for women.
"As everyone knows, I am a feminist," said Daoud, explaining why his novel paints a picture of an oppressive Islamicist patriarchy.
Resisting imprisonment at home
Shortly after "Houris" was published in France in 2024, Daoud was accused of being Islamophobic and playing into the hands of right-wing extremists.
He vehemently rejects these accusations: "Islamophobia is a Western disease, not mine," he said. "I experienced a civil war where I saw Islamists kill. I have the right to raise my voice, and you have no right to silence me."
Daoud's stance is comparable to that of his compatriot author and friend Boualem Sansal, who has also written about the Algerian civil war period and faced censorship while receiving important literary awards — including the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade in 2011.

For many years, Sansal's work has also been critical of both Islamist violence and the Algerian regime. Like Daoud, he recently became a French citizen. But he was arrested on entering Algeria in late 2024 and has since been sentenced to five years in prison.
This is unsettling for Daoud — not just because Sansal is a friend, but also because of the threat to his own safety.
"If the regime has managed to issue two international arrest warrants against me, then they really want me to sit at Boualem Sansal's side," he said.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[近日，殡葬业龙头福寿园发布2025年中期业绩。这家长期以高利润著称的公司，一度被外界称作“殡葬茅台”，却交出了自2013年港股上市以来的首份亏损报告。
 
公告显示，今年上半年，福寿园实现营收约6.11亿元，同比下降44.5％，净利润由盈转亏，亏损额达2.61亿元，这一反转令外界意外。
 
福寿园成立于1994年，是国内最早进入殡葬服务的民营企业之一。公司业务涵盖墓地销售、殡仪服务等，从上海起步，已扩展至全国40多个城市，主要面向中高端客户群体。
 
凭借特殊行业的壁垒，叠加老龄化趋势加剧，殡葬行业长期被认为是一门赚钱的生意，福寿园更是其中的“优等生”。2010年至2023年，公司营收从3.5亿元一路攀升到了26.28亿元，利润翻数倍，最高时利润达到近8亿元。
 
但另一方面，“天价墓地”、居民购买商品房存放骨灰盒等现象在近年来屡屡引发争议。近年来，多地出台墓地限价、限制经营性墓地占地面积等政策，整个殡葬行业开始调整，主攻高端市场的福寿园首当其冲。

墓穴单价接近腰斩
 
在福寿园的收入结构中，约八成来自墓园服务，其余来自殡仪服务等业务。过去几年，福寿园的高端墓穴价格一路攀升，2018年至2023年，平均售价从10.25万元涨到了11.95万元，2024年进一步升至12.12万元。
 
但在2025年上半年业绩报告中，墓地业务成了亏损的主要原因。
 
截至2025年6月30日，福寿园墓园服务收入约4.77亿元，同比下滑47.35％，在总营收中的占比降至78％左右。经营性墓穴作为主要产品，上半年销售了6253个，仅比去年同期减少451个，但总收入却缩水了约4亿元，降幅达到51％，平均售价从12万元骤降至6.3万元，几乎腰斩。
 
福寿园在公告中解释称，公司为适应不同地区的经济环境、消费行为和竞争格局，不得不下调产品均价，通过调整高、中附加值产品供给结构，增加中价位产品类别，叠加墓穴销售服务增值税等多因素，拉低了整体销售均价。
 
作为大本营，上海市场的表现尤其明显：上半年墓园及殡仪服务收入仅2.4亿元，较去年同期下降54.2％。此外，河南、黑龙江等地跌幅也超过50％。
 
这背后，与地方政策有一定关系。因土地资源稀缺、经济发展水平高等，上海的墓地价格普遍高于许多城市。上海民政部门近年来积极推行墓穴小型化，倡导海葬、草坪葬、花坛葬、壁葬、室内葬等节地生态葬式，要求公墓丰富葬式品种、降低价格水平。今年2月，上海还发布《殡葬服务项目清单》，明确提出对价格进行规范和引导。
 
事实上，直到2023年，福寿园的墓地售价仍在持续上升。由于早期土地多为划拨，成本极低，上海福寿园原始土地收购价仅190元/平方米，直到2016年，福寿园公开的墓地毛利率超过80％。2024年，福寿园遭遇上市以来的首次利润“腰斩”，归母净利润降至3.73亿元，同比下滑52.8％，为今年的亏损埋下伏笔。
 
福寿园国际集团首席品牌官邬亦波在接受《中国新闻周刊》采访时解释，和其他城市相比，上海业务在集团整体业绩中占比最高，今年上海地区主要推广节地生态创新类产品，均价在五六万元。虽然新产品仍处于市场接受阶段，但整体拉低了墓地的平均售价。
 
他指出，非经常性因素是导致福寿园上半年业绩亏损的重要原因之一。根据公司公告，2025年上半年，福寿园确认约2.18亿元资产减值，涉及4个公墓项目的商誉及其他长期资产。
 
“这些项目是我们在两三年前收购的，阶段性财务表现未达预期，只是出于财务审慎原则，我们计提了相应的减值准备。”邬亦波解释，“如果剔除上半年这些非经营性因素，公司盈利仍近2亿元，虽然有所下滑，但整体仍保持在可控的盈利轨道。”

先把骨灰寄存起来
 
值得注意的是，福寿园并非孤例。
 
2025年上半年，多家殡葬企业营收下滑甚至亏损。成立于2003年、总部位于南京的万桐园，同样面向中高端客户群体，2015年在港股上市。其半年报显示，上半年收益仅1106万元，同比下降54％，由盈利转为亏损。此外，安贤园、中国生命集团等公司也在半年报中提示殡葬收入承压。
 
周之远在西南地区一家福寿园做了10年墓园销售，过去两年，他明显感觉到客户变了。高消费仍在，但伴随经济转型，不少中产群体对买墓地的态度发生了转变：以前的客户都觉得，买墓地是必要的，并愿意承担高价，但如今不少人倾向于观望。
 
重庆殡葬从业者关万芬也有同感。他从2018年进入殡葬行业，近期注意到，在重庆，骨灰寄存量近年来明显上升。过去客户都会选择“热葬”，客户会在逝者去世三天内办完丧事，其间一定会定下墓位，销售抓住这个心理，交易非常容易。但近两年他接触的不少客户，会选择先把骨灰寄存起来，一年寄存费用只需要不到300元，逝者安葬的周期被无限延长，销售员的快速成交路径失效。
 
关万芬回忆，2020年之前，当地骨灰堂有8000个存放格位，却一直没满；2020年以后，新建了15000个格位，却依然供不应求。
 
此外，受访的销售普遍提到，近几年客户购买力下降。周之远在推荐高端墓位时，听到最多的回应是“钱不好挣，能办丧事就行了，不用追求太高档的墓地”。
 
另一位不愿具名的销售补充说，如今中介大量涌入，行业竞争空前激烈。大批中介围着同一批潜在客户反复游说，场面像极了早年保险行业的“跑单大战”。高端客户的殡葬认知，也从最初的懵懂，被科普成了半个专家，决策愈发谨慎。除了中介，高价服务带来的可观利润还吸引了不少风水师暗中角力，进一步拉长客户的决策周期，整体成交节奏明显放缓。
 
相比之下，中低端市场受影响较小。一般来说，低价客户的诉求很简单，只要便宜够用，比如壁墓只需3000元左右，一些生态葬价格更低，还能拿到政府补贴。

公益属性不断强化
 
受访的墓地销售都坦言，中高端墓位的需求并未消失，但政策调控加剧了客户的观望心态。
 
殡葬服务的特殊之处在于，它既是公共服务，也是一门生意。我国墓园分为公益性公墓与经营性公墓，前者属于社会福利设施，不以营利为目的，主要面向本辖区居民提供安葬服务，占比更大；后者则由企业市场化运作，以盈利为目标。
 
近年来，违规收费、捆绑消费、“天价殡葬”等市场乱象频发，传统墓葬方式对土地资源和生态环境的压力也日益显现。“国家在别的领域可以鼓励消费，但婚丧嫁娶历来禁止大操大办。如今我国的基本殡葬服务理念，已经基本明确为减项目、降费用、优服务。”一位殡葬领域专家对《中国新闻周刊》说。
 
殡葬的公益性与生态性开始不断被强调。2025年中央“一号文件”首次提出“深化殡葬改革，推进公益性生态安葬设施建设”，改革范围从农村延伸到城市。4月，民政部发布《殡葬管理条例（修订草案征求意见稿）》，明确殡葬服务必须“坚持公益属性”，并细化了墓位占地和墓碑高度上限，同时对殡葬价格违法行为和监管措施作出具体规定。
 
各地纷纷开展殡葬领域专项整治行动，并积极推广多种节地生态葬形式。据公开信息，2024年，江苏省徐州市专项整治“活人墓”“豪华墓”，对全市公益性公墓的价格开展集中普查，市本级殡葬告别服务平均降幅30％以上、经营性公墓销售均价降幅近2万元。江苏省宿迁市建立跨部门综合监管机制，本地5家经营性公墓价格降幅达5％—54.62％，并制定了统一的延伸服务收费清单。
 
监管必然冲击高端墓地市场。关万芬观察到，当前地方对活人墓、超标墓的严格管控，致使一些高端客户对墓位未来的担忧明显增加。人们通常会把买墓穴和买房子作比较，但两者背后的购买逻辑并不相同。买房可以多地置业，但墓园涉及地段、环境、风水等因素，一旦选定，客户往往不愿再改变位置，这在高端客户中体现得尤其明显。
 
不过，广西大学法学院副院长、广西大学价格收费监管研究中心主任董笃笃在近期关于“天价殡葬”的研究论文中分析指出，当下的政策，虽对殡葬领域的价格违法行为的打击作出了明确规定，但没有解决不合理高价的根本问题。所谓“天价墓地”“天价骨灰盒”，并不只是利润率过高，而是价格突破消费者心理阈值，形成交易壁垒，根源在于殡葬服务市场供需失衡与公共属性的双重偏离。
 
董笃笃认为，单纯通过调控价格或利润率的“一刀切”并非治本之道，矫正价格失真，同时要求供给端主动披露服务和价格，强化信息对称，才能让殡葬服务回归理性、可预期的合理区间，营造平等、公平的交易环境。
 
中国殡葬协会原秘书长孙树仁在接受《中国新闻周刊》采访时也提到，殡葬服务涉及死亡教育、地方风俗和文化等多重因素，中国殡葬行业长期存在三大短板：先进的殡葬文化供给滞后、适应现代化进程的管理体制机制供给滞后、殡葬政策法规供给滞后。这些短板是导致行业暴利和部分腐败乱象的深层原因。
 
在他看来，要真正改变现状，让殡葬事业体现应有的人性关怀和社会文明底线，不仅要做服务项目与价格的减法，更要将传统丧葬文化提升到现代生命文化，根本整治行业顽疾，铲除滋生腐败的土壤，同时建立完善的现代殡葬治理体系，并以健全的政策法规作支撑。补齐这三大短板，行业才能完成从传统到现代的转型。
 
代际变化正在发生
 
前述不愿具名的殡葬专家坦言，目前殡葬服务的公益性、节地化将是大势所趋，经营性墓地作为公益性墓地的补充，必须顺应政策与需求转型。眼下，包括福寿园在内的多家企业都在调整产品结构，应对政策与市场的双重变化。
 
在一线从业者看来，这种变化已经迫在眉睫。周之远向《中国新闻周刊》介绍，以前他接待客户时，策略是尽量推高价墓位；如今的目标变成了“先留住客户”，不再执着于单价，而是希望提升销量。他所在的本地福寿园也开始缩小墓位面积、优化绿化设计，推出更多平价产品。不过，他直言，福寿园动作调整仍然偏慢，也是今年公司业绩承压的原因之一。
 
对于福寿园来说，调整并不轻松，受访的墓地销售从业者都提到，福寿园长期以高标准建设墓园，绿化、设计、用材成本都很高，降价空间有限。此外，作为连锁龙头，任何调整都需层层审批，少则几月，长则半年。
 
相比之下，关万芬所在的公司反应更快，冲击较小。近一年多来，公司主动下调产品定位，把原本中高端墓位在面积和配套上“减配”，“就像把房子从两室两厅改成小两室”，既符合节地生态葬政策，也贴合客户诉求。价格也同步下调，一些原本定价5万—7万元的产品，下调至2.5万—3.5万元，相当于打了对折，也直接刺激了客户的需求。
 
更重要的是，调整后产品数量增加，同样一亩地，过去只能布置三百个墓位，如今可以设计到五六百个。在殡葬服务体系中，墓地价格除了一次性支付的墓地购置费用，还有一个重要收入是一定期限的管理维护费，类似物业管理费。销售的墓位数量增加，公司增加了相关服务收入。“我们用量来弥补高端萎缩的趋势，虽营收下滑幅度加大，但还是会坚持平稳过渡。”关万芬说。
 
周之远提到，行业的竞争也在加剧，因门槛不高，近年来建筑、房地产等行业的从业者也开始进入殡葬市场。在他看来，眼下殡葬企业拼的是反应速度，谁能快速顺应环境，谁就能占得先机。
 
邬亦波在接受《中国新闻周刊》采访时提到，此次半年报也让公司内部开始重视和思考，如何在强化公益属性的政策指引下顺势而为，确立新的发展坐标。除了拓展价格可及的中段产品，他坦言，福寿园成立31年以来，最主要的业务就是提供人生百年以后的各类殡葬服务，如今计划把服务范围拓展到“全生命周期”。
 
邬亦波曾参加公司策划的“生前葬礼”，主角是一位年轻人，要求来宾穿二次元服装。随着代际更替，人们对死亡的认知正在变化。有医学院老师想要提前规划自己的安葬方式，也有人希望殡葬服务能覆盖遗产托管、遗物收纳等环节。
 
此外，福寿园还与上海大学合作，开展千人社工培养项目，培养生命教育工作者，并探索骨灰小型化、纪念形式数字化等模式。“很多模式我们自己都还没完全悟透，也没开始深度推广，但代际殡葬观念变化已经发生。”邬亦波说。
 
在关万芬看来，尽管当前政策调整对行业带来了一定影响，但从长远来看是利好。殡葬行业长期以来野蛮生长，“天价墓地”背后，折射出人们对墓穴大小和规格的盲目攀比，进而加剧大众对墓地的偏见。如今的规范调整，有助于市场回归理性。
 
而从更宏观的角度看，市场需求并未减弱。到2024年底，中国60岁及以上人口首次突破3亿，殡葬服务总体需求依旧在上升。但生态葬的推广、年轻一代对传统丧葬观念的转变，正在重新切分传统公墓的市场蛋糕。对企业而言，未来只有一条路：转型并提供更具创新性的服务。如今，关万芬也在思考，如何借助AI技术，让年轻一代重新理解和接纳殡葬，这将成为企业能力的新考验。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[“现在不是钱的事，而是有钱也拿不到货。”北京一家蜜雪冰城门店店长对《中国新闻周刊》坦言。
 
今年夏天以来，受外卖平台“补贴大战”刺激，茶饮企业销售火爆。然而，在遍布全国的蜜雪冰城门店上演着反常一幕——招牌产品柠檬水悄然停售。
 
蜜雪冰城相关负责人表示，近期一批进口柠檬受天气影响延期到港，同时国内已经进入采摘期，需储存一段时间优化口感才能使用，但柠檬整体储备非常充足。


 

 
柠檬告急
 
《中国新闻周刊》在北京走访了多家蜜雪冰城门店，数位负责人都反映，柠檬水已经停售约一周，就算“抢货”，每日配额也仅够维持一天半的销售。中国人民大学附近一家蜜雪冰城门店负责人透露，自9月20日起，需每日早7点通过特定App抢购，且每家门店限购一两箱，“抢到就是赚到，抢不到只能干瞪眼”。
 
僧多粥少的局面，暴露出头部品牌在供应链管理上的短板：过度依赖单一产地带来的规模效应，反而在危急时刻放大了系统性风险。
 
重庆市潼南区是世界三大优质柠檬产地之一，也是蜜雪冰城冰鲜柠檬水的主要原料“源头”。2023年，蜜雪冰城卖出了超过10亿杯冰鲜柠檬水，消耗了约11.5万吨柠檬。
 
据灼识咨询报告，按2023年的采购量计，蜜雪集团是中国最大的柠檬采购商。按2023年饮品出杯量计，蜜雪冰城的冰鲜柠檬水、新鲜冰激凌和珍珠奶茶是中国现制饮品行业销量最高的三个单品，其中每10杯现制柠檬水中有超过8杯来自蜜雪冰城。
 
蜜雪冰城通过其全资子公司“雪王农业”，与潼南的柠檬种植户建立了紧密的合作关系。雪王农业副总经理于洋曾对媒体介绍，公司每年会对合作果园的基础设施、农药喷施记录、果树健康程度等进行评估，达到标准的果园才会被纳入合作范围。“对于那些与我们建立长期关系的柠檬种植户，我们通常会承诺最低采购量及固定采购价格，从而保障他们的利益。”蜜雪集团在招股书中提到。
 
但在供需失衡的市场环境下，往日大路货的柠檬摇身变为紧俏物资。
 
从采摘周期来看，以川渝地区为主产区的黄柠檬，主采摘季集中在每年9—11月；华南的广东、云南等地，则会在2—4月产出“春果”。采摘后的柠檬鲜果，需通过低温冷藏、通风控湿等专业储存方式，拉高果实香气、平衡口感。
 
今年以来，黄柠檬的价格在短时间内飙升3—5倍，零售市场上单斤价格甚至突破20元，许多中小型商家迫于成本的压力，不得不下架了众多含有黄柠檬的饮品。
 
据农业农村部监测数据，截至9月17日，全国柠檬批发均价已达15元/公斤，较去年同期近乎翻倍。这场席卷全球的柠檬减产潮，源于南欧、南美等主产区遭遇的极端天气组合拳——干旱、暴雨与低温冻害接踵而至，导致国际供应量锐减约6%。国内四川安岳、重庆潼南等核心产区同样受灾，去年持续干旱影响花期授粉，今年春季又遭异常低温侵袭，黄柠檬挂果率大幅下降。
 
柠檬供需失衡
 
此次柠檬危机绝非偶然，而是茶饮行业长期积累的结构性矛盾的一次爆发。
 
我国70%以上的黄柠檬产自四川安岳和重庆潼南，形成“把所有鸡蛋放在一个篮子”的产业格局。相比之下，咖啡行业可通过巴西、哥伦比亚等多地采购分散风险，而中国柠檬产业尚未建立全球化布局，抗风险能力孱弱。更令人担忧的是，90%的茶饮门店使用普通黄柠檬，品种同质化严重。
 
农业农村部统计数据显示，果树种植周期长达3—5年，而茶饮市场扩张规模年增20%，2025年全国柠檬种植面积仅同比增长8%，远低于饮品店数量15%的扩张速度。这种供需错配在爆款单品占比超60%的新茶饮行业尤为致命，任何原料波动都会引发连锁反应。
 
需求端增长的一个重要源头，是因为“柠檬水”产品，成为茶饮行业中一个爆款赛道。作为饮品界的“万金油”，柠檬的应用场景不断拓宽，市场规模也持续扩大。
 
根据咖门发布的《2025中国饮品行业产品报告》，2024年，在38个主流茶饮品牌上新的1578款产品中，柠檬的使用次数高达228次，连续2年稳居水果应用榜前列。以蜜雪冰城为例，仅“冰鲜柠檬水”一款产品一年卖超10亿杯。
 
柠檬除用于饮品，还广泛应用于餐饮调味、烘焙、制药、化妆品等领域，需求多元化进一步加剧供需矛盾。
 
此外，作为国产柠檬出口“主力军”，安岳柠檬在减产的同时，还要完成出口订单，今年1—5月，其自营出口额同比增长22.3%。在全球柠檬减产的背景下，国内市场对柠檬的需求量却持续增大。根据中研普华产业研究院的分析预测，2025年，由鲜食柠檬、饮料原料、深加工产品三部分组成的中国柠檬行业市场规模将达580亿元，较2024年增加70亿元，同比增速达13.7%。内外叠加，导致柠檬的供需缺口进一步拉大。
 
压力给到“加盟商”
 
对于主打“4元柠檬水”的蜜雪冰城而言，这场危机直接冲击着利润根基。在其成本构成中，柠檬占比超30%，若按当前市价采购且无法转嫁成本，单杯亏损可达1—2元。按日均售出50万杯计算，每日直接损失高达50万—100万元。更严峻的是，“高性价比”的品牌定位压缩了涨价空间，迫使企业在保量与保利间艰难抉择。
 
压力传导至终端，中小加盟商首当其冲。多个门店反馈，柠檬水停售后单日流水锐减约30%，而房租、人工等固定成本仍需支付。蜜雪冰城北京大钟寺店店长无奈表示：“上午十一点就卖光全天配额，顾客失望离开的场景每天都在上演。”
 
《中国新闻周刊》实地走访发现，在采访的30家门店中，已经有14家门店停售柠檬水，约40%的蜜雪冰城门店已停售柠檬水近一周。
 
《中国新闻周刊》对20位消费者的调查显示，50%的顾客每周购买柠檬水超6次，其中60%明确表示不会选择其他替代饮品。“专门来买柠檬水的客人很多，现在只能看着他们空手离开。”蜜雪冰城人民大学店店员说。当核心SKU因原料短缺被迫下架，品牌忠诚度将面临考验。
 
供应链的稳定，已成为品牌可持续发展的“生命线”。茶饮的“平价时代”不能只依靠市场红利，更需通过供应链的不断完善和源头的精准把控。这场由柠檬引发的风暴，留给整个行业的思考已然紧迫——当极端天气成为新常态，没有任何企业能靠单一要素取胜。

        <link href="http://news.inewsweek.cn/finance/2025-09-23/26832.shtml"/>
        <updated>2025-09-23T06:22:05.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[在日本，预制菜是消费者食用小龙虾最常见的方式。
 
麻辣、蒜香、十三香等调味小龙虾，通过速冻锁鲜、真空包装成为冷冻食品。消费者从超市买回家后，先进行解冻，小龙虾也在这一过程中吸收调料入味，加热后即可食用。
 
时行株式会社的负责人王宏鑫，每年会出口6个货柜约150吨的预制小龙虾到日本，除了调味小龙虾，还有清水虾、虾尾、纯虾肉等产品。产品主要供给东京、大阪等华人聚集城市的超市。“以往主要给中华物产店供货，从去年开始，日系超市也开始采购我们的产品。”王宏鑫告诉《中国新闻周刊》，近几年，超市冷冻柜里“中华料理”类的预制菜也越来越丰富了，市场在增长。
 
小龙虾是中餐预制菜中率先实现即食化的“明星”产品，然而，在线下超市购买冷冻小龙虾对国内消费者来说仍比较小众。国内有全球最大的小龙虾养殖基地，更易获得活小龙虾，出于对食材的“新鲜”要求，也更偏好活小龙虾。
 
在日本，活虾养殖产业受限，预制菜崛起已有50多年的历史，当地消费者有更普遍的接受度，市场更成熟。相比国内，预制中餐在这里更“好卖”。

“日本的年轻人不剥虾壳”
 
王宏鑫做中日食品贸易业务已有十多年的经验，最初负责将日本海产品出口中国的业务。2017年后，他成立公司并“反向操作”，在国内寻找有出口资质的工厂，贴牌后销往日本市场，产品则以海鲜类预制食品为主。
 
“日本人对于预制菜的接受度很高。无论是家庭、便利店、超市、连锁餐饮店，预制菜都随处可见。”他表示，几乎所有的日系超市，冷链产品都能占比四成。以海虾为例，日本以售卖冷冻虾仁居多。
 
“日本的大部分年轻人都不会剥虾壳。”王宏鑫表示，相比之下，国内消费者仍保留了去早市购买活虾、活鱼，自己清洗、剥壳的饮食习惯，“90后”甚至一部分“00后”消费者都能接受这一习惯。
 
他认为，社会发展到一定程度后，食品工业化会将便利性做到极致，提升了商品的附加价值，也帮助消费者省去烦琐的人力工作。例如，将主料、酱包、配料等分开的“ABC包”，消费者购买后还需要另外找器皿放置材料，并考虑先后顺序，不够便利。即食食品加热后就能直接吃，凭借技术，解冻过程中的入味效果往往也比现做入味更好。
 
据日本冷冻协会最新数据，日本2024年冷冻食品消费额达1.3万亿日元（折合人民币约625亿元），再创历史新高。全球统计数据库Statista以即热、即食类预制食品为统计口径，2022年，日本人均消费量为23.2千克，中国、美国和英国的人均消费量分别为9.1千克、16.1千克和16.8千克。
 
华福证券研报分析，20世纪60年代至70年代，日本政府出台“冷藏链劝告”推动冷链建设，受学校供餐制度驱动，团餐标准化需求上升，冷冻产值快速提高。20世纪90年代后，日本泡沫经济破裂，但因家庭小型化及便捷性需求，C端冷冻调理食品迎来拐点，接力产值增长。
 
日本消费者对中华料理的喜爱也推动了预制中餐市场的发展。王宏鑫表示，不少日本品牌已经研发了青椒肉丝、麻婆豆腐等经典中华料理的预制食品。用小龙虾产品打开销售渠道后，近几年，他也持续向日本市场引进其他预制技术成熟的产品，如虾饺以及烤鱼、剁椒鱼、酸菜鱼等调味鱼片。
 
“以鱼类食品为例，日本的终端个人消费者是吃不完一整条鱼的，要做一人食分量。我们需要将鱼切成鱼片，并将1/2或1/4的鱼片调味后制成产品，才能面向日本的零售市场。”他解释。


食品安全优先
 
令王宏鑫印象深刻的，还有日本预制菜加工业的高门槛。
 
“预制菜加工企业要遵守严格的食品卫生法，法律明确规定了添加剂的使用场景及用量，相关部门对工厂的持续监管也非常严格。”他说。
 
日本规定添加剂要遵循“合法、必要、适量”，认为非法添加或超范围地使用添加剂掩盖品质缺陷，会产生巨大的食品卫生风险。以防腐剂为例，日本一袋保质期为9个月的火锅底料，被允许的防腐剂添加量小于0.05%，100克火锅底料里面的防腐剂含量必须在0.05克以下。
 
“食品安全是第一优先级。对于食品加工企业而言，需要更多研究如何通过低温或高温杀菌、密封包装、冷链与HACCP（危害分析和关键点控制），在不依赖或减少添加剂的前提下，实现延长保质期，提升稳定性的效果。”他说。
 
对于冷冻食品，日本的全链条品质管理体系由“食品卫生法＋加工许可证及资质＋HACCP管理制度＋冷链温控＋标签追溯”构成。
 
北京玖玖一番餐饮管理有限公司的创始人沙铭，负责中日餐饮交流研学业务，她告诉《中国新闻周刊》，日本的中央厨房和食品加工行业会严格执行“中心温度检测”流程，使用一根长长的专业温度计探针，在食材入库时进行中心温度检测，以验证冷链运输环节是否达标。
 
“例如，冷藏蔬菜的中心温度规定为0—3度。一旦检测超出范围，则意味着食材新鲜度与安全风险已不可控，必须退货处理。”她说。
 
此外，日本预制菜监管体系要求加工、运输和储存流程都遵循“可记录，可追溯，可拒收”原则，一旦违规会严格追责。
 
王宏鑫解释，关键在于，监管部门收录了原材料产地或养殖场、供货商、加工企业、收获和出售日期等一系列中间环节信息。消费者一旦反映问题，监管部门可以通过产品标签向上追溯，控制住出问题的具体批次，并通过媒体通知主动召回，提供相应补偿，对问题厂家进行处罚。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[“发一个不敢发朋友圈的炫耀帖，自从工作后每两年收入就上一个台阶。工作五年已经赚到刚毕业时想不到的数字（感谢公司的平台）。”
 
清华大学学霸吴舰可能没想到，两年前自己的一条“低调炫富帖”，可能会给自己带来牢狱之灾。
 



吴舰 图/吴舰的Linkedin（领英）账号
 
2023年，定位在美国的一位网友在小红书上匿名发帖，晒出自己的收入照片：2022年他的收入高达2305万美元，约合人民币1.67亿元。他坦言，同公司的人很可能认出来，但“不需要那么在意”。但他没想到，这条帖文迅速引爆网络，引发当地媒体关注。
 



吴舰的社交媒体账号截图
 
外界很快推测出他所在的公司正是美国顶级量化对冲基金Two Sigma，公司随之启动内部调查。2023年10月，据美国媒体报道，这位炫富者便是Two Sigma的量化研究副总裁、中国公民吴舰。此时他已被公司停职，2024年被公司解雇。
 
近期，该事件迎来了新的司法进展。当地时间2025年9月11日，美国纽约南区地方法院和美国证券交易委员会（下称SEC）同时宣布对吴舰提起民事与刑事诉讼，指控他电汇欺诈、证券欺诈和洗钱，违反证券法等。一旦罪名成立，吴将面临最高60年监禁。
 
吴舰是谁？
 
吴舰的履历堪称华丽。2023年底，吴舰曾向纽约州法院提交诉状，反驳公司的指控，并详细介绍了自己的专业背景。
 
综合公开信息，吴舰出生于1991年，在安徽省合肥市长大。因在全国物理与数学竞赛中表现优异，吴舰在2007年进入清华大学，并获得自动化工程学士学位。2011年，他进入南加州大学攻读博士学位，2013年转入康奈尔大学，2018年拿到运筹学与信息工程博士学位。
 
吴舰在2018年加入Two Sigma。仅三年时间，他就从量化研究员升任为副总裁，2022年初又晋升为高级副总裁。
 
Two Sigma是美国华尔街一家头部量化对冲基金，2001年成立，管理资产逾1100亿美元，在全球有大约1500名员工，多来自名校数学、计算机和工程专业。
 
与传统基金经理依赖经验与调研不同，量化基金不相信“主观感觉”，而是坚信数据与算法的力量，利用数学模型、计算机程序，从海量数据中寻找规律，预测证券价格并自动下单，帮助客户实现投资目标。一直以来，Two Sigma强调自己有别于传统的投资企业，自称是一家“科技驱动型对冲基金公司”。
 
正因如此，模型的精度与独创性至关重要。吴舰的职责，正是研究开发并监控这类能够产生交易信号的“赚钱模型”，主要涉及在纽约证券交易所等交易所上市的美国股票。
 
如今，他被指控电汇欺诈、证券欺诈和洗钱，正是因为在这些模型上动了手脚。
 
私下操控超过14个模型
 
SEC起诉书披露，从2021年11月至2023年8月，在未经授权的情况下，吴舰私自篡改了至少14个模型的关键参数。
 
按照Two Sigma规定，新开发的量化模型必须与现有模型保持较低相关性，确保它能提供独特的预测，而不是重复现有的预测，同时也会衡量其所带来的收益。“去相关参数”是一个关键的指标，参数值越低，模型的预期相关性越高。
 
调查发现，在公司不知情的情况下，吴舰在提交审批时填报可通过审核的参数值，在模型获批后又在系统中秘密将该值降低或接近零，使模型表面上产生了新的收益，但实际只是复制已有的模型成果。
 
SEC起诉书上举例，他在三个模型中把小数点后多加两个零，将参数缩小至原值的1%。
 



 
当地时间9月11日，SEC公布对吴舰的起诉书，展示了吴舰对模型去相关参数的篡改操作：在模型报批通过后，他于新建的系统中秘密地在原参数值小数点后添加两个零。
 
这一做法直接影响了模型绩效。2023年10月，Two Sigma向客户承认，因这些“未授权修改”，部分基金获利4.5亿美元，另一些基金则损失1.7亿美元。公司会对相关客户作出赔偿。
 
起诉书指出，吴舰的动机与薪酬机制直接相关。在Two Sigma内部，年度激励薪酬，包括现金奖金和绩效奖励，与员工开发的模型表现挂钩。
 
2022年底，吴舰曾与主管谈判，要求根据其模型的表现大幅增加薪酬，公司最终支付给他超过2300万美元的薪酬，其中部分正是基于这些“新模型”的业绩。据报道，吴舰随后用这些收入在纽约曼哈顿购入一套价值数百万美元的公寓。
 
这起事件被曝光的导火索，便是上述“炫富帖”。吴舰在社交媒体上的高调发言引起Two Sigma注意，公司随即对吴舰的模型展开审查。为掩盖此前行为，他不仅将调查导向其他员工，还对模型的去相关性参数进行了再次修改。2023年8月，吴舰承认在未获批准的情况下多次更改参数，随后被公司解雇。根据美国纽约南区检察官办公室消息，吴舰目前处于潜逃状态。
 
规则跟不上算法
 
2023年10月，吴舰的身份被美国媒体曝光。同年底，吴舰向纽约州法院提起诉讼，指控Two Sigma诽谤，认为公司声明失实。他声称自己虽然参与了模型开发，但并不决定模型的实际部署，损失应归咎于投资组合管理和交易团队的“鲁莽决策”。
 
吴舰还辩称，研究人员在模型上线后，需要经常修改参数或更新数据，“由于缺乏有效控制，Two Sigma的研究员和工程师经常在没有正式批准的情况下修改模型，这是常见做法”。
 
最新披露的纽约南区联邦地区法院的刑事起诉书显示，吴舰被控电信欺诈、证券欺诈和洗钱，SEC则根据证券法的反欺诈条款，对其提起了民事诉讼。他利用涉嫌欺诈所得购买的新公寓和其他财产，可能面临没收。
 
南开大学金融发展研究院院长田利辉对《中国新闻周刊》指出，吴舰案并非孤例，而是算法伦理失守的系统性风险。在技术层面，量化模型的逻辑缺乏透明度，监管难以穿透，“黑箱”特性让参数篡改轻易规避审计。
 
事实上，Two Sigma虽曾以技术可靠著称，内部早就有风险预警。根据SEC披露，2019年3月，有员工曾提醒公司内部控制存在漏洞，研究员可在未经审查的情况下更改模型参数，但管理层长期没有整改。今年1月，SEC执法部门代理主任桑杰·瓦德瓦在一份声明中直言：随着投资顾问愈发依赖模型和先进技术，健全的合规体系至关重要，而Two Sigma对已知的问题长期不作为。
 
芝加哥资深金融律师R·塔马拉·德·席尔瓦近期也撰文指出，Two Sigma虽然设有模型审批流程和安全代码库，但对高度依赖模型的基金而言，仅靠审批远远不够，持续监控、独立验证以及对参数变更的严格管理才是关键。
 
田利辉建议，这一案件的启示在于，在量化交易中，要强制算法透明化，例如借助区块链技术对模型代码与参数变更进行存证，让每行代码都可追溯。此外，他还指出，激励机制也需要重新被审视。
 
Two Sigma将绩效奖金与模型收益直接挂钩，一定程度上促使吴舰在高额奖金诱惑下更易铤而走险。田利辉认为，激励机制要告别“唯收益论”，也需要将夏普比率、最大回撤等风险调整后的指标纳入核心评价。此外，还应推动建立全球监管联盟，统一算法交易标准，防止跨境监管套利。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[当地时间9月17日，美联储联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议纪要释放关键政策信号——将联邦基金利率目标区间下调25个基点至4.00%—4.25%，这是自2024年12月美联储降息25个基点后时隔9个月的首次降息操作，不仅标志着美国货币政策正式进入宽松周期“前奏”，更将通过美元全球储备货币的地位，引发全球流动性、资本流动与汇率格局的连锁调整。对于正处于经济修复关键期的中国而言，如何在这一轮外部政策变动中把握机遇、规避风险，成为当前宏观调控与市场稳定的重要命题。

不是激进转向，而是“预防式平衡”
 
此次美联储选择25个基点的降息幅度，并非偶然，而是基于美国经济“通胀黏性未消、增长韧性承压”的现实权衡，也体现了其以数据为导向的货币政策框架的核心逻辑。从早前市场预期来看，本次降息25个基点本就是大概率事件——此前芝商所CME Group数据就曾预测，本次会议降息25个基点的可能性为96.1%。而部分市场呼吁的50个基点的激进式降息并未被采纳。背后的关键考量，在于美联储对通胀回落节奏与经济下行风险的双重把控：一方面，前几个月美国核心通胀环比增速已出现连续放缓迹象，服务业价格压力边际缓解，表明通胀下行路径基本稳固，为降息提供了“窗口”；另一方面，经济韧性的边际弱化信号已不容忽视——2025年8月美国失业率升至4.3%，创四年来新高，同期非农就业新增人数远低于预期，劳动力市场与消费动能的走弱，让政策层不得不提前应对经济增长放缓的风险。
 
正如美联储主席鲍威尔在会后声明中强调的，“尽管过去两年中通胀有所缓解，但仍高于联储长期2%的目标”。若此时美联储选择一次性降息50基点，很可能被市场解读为“货币政策过度转向”，进而重燃通胀预期，反而增加后续政策调控的难度。相比之下，25个基点的温和调整，既释放了应对增长风险的政策信号，又为未来保留了灵活调整空间——若通胀反弹，可暂停降息；若经济进一步走弱，也可继续适度宽松，是典型的“预防式降息”。
 
值得关注的是，从美国联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）投票结果来看，此次降息幅度得到11票赞成、1票反对。唯一反对票来自美国总统特朗普提名、刚刚出任美联储理事的白宫经济顾问委员会主席斯蒂芬·米兰，他主张降息50个基点来立即刺激经济并应对潜在衰退风险。这一投票格局恰恰传递出美联储的政策独立性——即便存在不同声音，仍坚持基于经济数据的审慎立场，而非短期政治压力或市场情绪。这种独立性对于维护美联储政策可信度至关重要，能有效避免短期干预演变为长期政策失控，为全球市场注入稳定预期。
 
全球连锁反应：流动性重构下的机遇与分化
 
作为全球第一大经济体的央行，美联储的降息决策绝非美国内政，而是通过“美元-大宗商品-资本流动”的传导链条，对全球经济产生显著外溢效应，其影响既有机遇，也伴随着分化与风险。
 
首先是汇率与大宗商品的格局变动。9月18日，美元指数（DXY）迅速下跌至96.22，创2022年2月以来新低。美元走弱直接带动非美货币普遍升值，以美元计价的原油、有色金属等资源类大宗商品价格将迎来阶段性上涨，这对资源出口国而言，无疑是经济复苏的“强心剂”，但对中国、德国等制造业大国来说，原材料成本上升将加剧生产端压力，同时本币升值可能削弱出口竞争力，尤其对依赖低成本优势的出口导向型企业形成挑战。
 
其次是国际资本流动的重新配置。美联储降息后，美元资产收益率相对下降，新兴市场资产吸引力将上升，投资者将调整资产的跨国配置，资本有望从发达市场回流至新兴市场，推动后者股市与债市回暖。从短期市场表现来看，这种分化已有所体现：9月18日，美股三大指数涨跌互现，但道琼斯指数创下历史新高，美债收益率也出现调整，尤其是短期美债收益率对政策预期反应更为敏感；欧洲市场、东京日经225指数（收涨1.15%）、韩国综合指数（单日上涨1.40%）均表现强劲；A股则呈现冲高回落态势，但这更多是对前期降息预期充分消化后的正常回调，整体仍处于震荡上行通道，并未脱离基本面支撑。
 
此外，全球货币政策协调难度将进一步加大。部分发达经济体（如欧元区、英国）可能跟随美联储降息，以避免本币过度升值损害出口；新兴市场则获得更大的货币政策自主空间，可适度宽松以支持经济复苏。但各国经济基本面差异巨大——有的仍在应对高通胀，有的已陷入增长停滞，这种差异可能导致全球货币政策“各自为战”，增加国际经济政策的不确定性，甚至引发新的贸易与金融摩擦。
 
对于我国而言，美元走弱的影响呈现鲜明的“双面性”：一方面，以外币计价的中国出口商品竞争力将获得阶段性提振，同时进口原油、有色金属等大宗商品的成本会同步下降，这对缓解制造业企业生产端压力、为外贸韧性托底具有直接积极意义；但另一方面，人民币将面临阶段性升值压力，这种升值会直接传导至出口导向型制造业企业——尤其对依赖低成本优势的劳动密集型企业而言，汇率端的利润挤压效应已不容忽视，可能对其订单稳定性与盈利空间形成挑战。同时，中美利差收窄减轻跨境资本流出压力，对我国资本市场将形成短期支撑，北向资金或加速回流，利好股市估值修复。同时，外部流动性环境的宽松，将进一步拓宽我国国内货币政策的灵活操作空间——无需过度受制于资本外流与汇率波动的双重约束，政策层可更从容地通过降准、结构性货币政策工具（如定向支持中小微、科技创新领域的再贷款）等方式加码稳增长，为国内经济修复提供更适配的货币环境。
 
但必须警惕的是，美联储降息可能引发我国汇率双向波动幅度的加大：若升值过快，会削弱出口企业竞争力；若短期波动剧烈，又可能引发短期投机性资本冲击。这要求政策层在“稳增长”与“防风险”之间精准拿捏平衡，核心是进一步强化人民币汇率弹性——让汇率在合理均衡水平上的双向波动充分发挥“缓冲器”作用，减少资本流动对国内金融市场的冲击。
 
此外，外部环境的不确定性并未因单次降息而消除：美联储后续降息路径并非“既定脚本”，而是高度依赖美国核心通胀能否持续向2%长期目标靠近、就业市场是否进一步走弱等数据的演变等。这意味着，我国需持续跟踪美联储政策动向，精准评估其对全球金融市场、大宗商品价格、跨境资本流动的传导效应，尤其要关注美联储在“控通胀”与“保增长”之间的权衡变化。在此过程中，必须坚守国内宏观政策的定力，坚决避免外部扰动打乱“稳增长、调结构、防风险”的既定节奏。
 
中国应对：短期稳平衡，长期强韧性
 
面对美联储降息带来的外部环境变化，我国的应对核心应该是保持定力、坚持以我为主、统筹内外平衡——既不被动跟随外部政策节奏，也不忽视外溢效应，而是立足国内经济修复的实际需求，通过强化内生动力、优化政策工具，将外部波动转化为长期发展的机遇窗口。
 
一方面，保持货币政策自主性与精准性的统一。美元走弱、中美利差收窄，确实为中国货币政策提供了更宽松的操作空间，但这并不意味着可以“大水漫灌”，正确的路径应该是：根据国内经济修复节奏和结构优化需要，继续保持流动性合理充裕，引导实际利率下行，灵活运用降准、结构性工具等举措精准发力，引导金融资源更多流向科技创新、绿色转型和中小微企业。同时，加强预期管理，深化汇率市场化改革，增强人民币汇率弹性，强化对跨境资本流动的监测与调节，让汇率在合理均衡水平上双向波动，防止短期投机性资金冲击金融稳定。
 
另一方面，要借力外部机遇，破解出口与进口的“双向矛盾”。针对美元走弱对中国经济影响的“两面性”，短期可通过出口退税、汇率避险工具推广等政策缓解出口企业压力，但长期根本之策在于推动产业升级—— 通过减税降费、技术补贴等手段，支持出口企业向高附加值、高技术含量领域转型，摆脱对低成本优势的依赖。只有当中国出口的核心竞争力从价格转向技术，才能真正抵御汇率波动的冲击。
 
同时，也是很关键的一点，吸引长期资本，关键在制度型开放而非短期红利。美联储降息后，国际资本回流新兴市场的趋势，为中国资本市场带来了增量机遇。但要留住长期资本，不能仅靠短期政策红利，更需深化资本市场改革：如完善退市制度、加强投资者保护、扩大制度型开放等。资本市场的长期吸引力源于制度完善与基本面支撑，只有当全球资本看到中国经济的长期增长潜力，看到中国资本市场的规则透明度与稳定性，才能实现“短期流入”向“长期配置”的转变。
 
此外，要密切跟踪外部政策动态，强化预期管理与跨周期调节。根据美联储此次会议更新的点阵图，今年年内还将再降息两次（各25个基点），这意味着外部流动性宽松的趋势尚未结束。我国需动态评估后续降息对全球资本流动、大宗商品价格的影响，提前做好政策储备——例如，若后续美元进一步走弱导致大宗商品价格大幅上涨，可通过增加战略储备、稳定供应链等方式平抑输入性通胀；若全球经济陷入衰退风险，可加大财政支出力度，推动新基建、民生工程等重点领域投资落地，增强内需对经济增长的拉动作用。同时，要加强与市场的沟通，及时释放政策信号，避免市场因信息不对称产生过度预期或恐慌。
 
美联储此次降息，是全球经济从“高利率周期” 向“宽松周期”过渡的重要节点，也为中国经济提供了外部环境缓和期。但需清醒认识到，外部政策红利终究是辅助，中国经济的长期稳定增长，仍需依赖内生动力的强化——无论是科技自立自强、产业结构升级，还是消费市场扩容、资本市场完善，都是提升经济韧性的关键。在应对短期外部波动的同时，夯实长期发展的制度基础，唯有如此，才能在全球经济格局调整中把握主动，实现经济高质量发展的目标。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[On September 21 and 22, Australia, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and six other countries recognized a Palestinian state. Israel has responded defiantly. Following Sunday’s recognitions, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared in a Hebrew-language video statement: “It will not happen. A Palestinian state will not be established west of the Jordan.” Although Netanyahu will only make a final decision on Israel’s full response when he returns to the region after meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, his coalition has repeatedly threatened to annex West Bank territory and collapse the Palestinian Authority entirely.
This tit-for-tat serves nobody’s interests. Israelis will lose as the momentum around recognition and their government’s aggressive response accelerate their country’s diplomatic, economic, and cultural isolation. Palestinians will lose, too. On their own, the recognitions fail to afford real, tangible benefits to the Palestinian people or to help the struggling PA escape crisis. Instead, they give hard-line elements of the Israeli government more pretext to try to suppress Palestinian self-determination and further weaken the PA. Even before the recognitions were formally announced, the Israeli government had begun to cite them in fresh steps to expand settlements in the West Bank. On August 20, Israel approved the construction of the controversial E1 settlement that effectively bisects the West Bank; Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich explicitly framed the move as a response to calls for Palestinian statehood. “This reality finally buries the idea of a Palestinian state,” he said, “because there is nothing to recognize and no one to recognize.”
But something good could still come out of the momentum toward recognition if both the Israeli and Palestinian leadership look beyond the symbolism—and if international actors work to market recognition not as a unilateral action but as a small part of an arduous multilateral push for mutual recognition by Israel and Palestine, the normalization of diplomatic ties between Israel and its neighbors, and greater regional integration. The recognizing governments need to more clearly situate their decision within the so-called New York Declaration (endorsed overwhelmingly on September 12 by the UN General Assembly) and the July UN conference on a two-state solution co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia. Both propose more practical ways forward—and Israel should take the opportunity that these initiatives offer. The New York Declaration outlines a comprehensive framework for ending Israel’s military operations in Gaza, returning the remaining hostages, dismantling Hamas, and rebuilding the strip and backs these steps with security guarantees and initiatives to boost regional integration.
All these measures are consistent with Israel’s military and political objectives. Israeli leaders must look past the ideological rigidity that drives them to oppose any notion of Palestinian self-determination. They need to use this moment to engage with France and Saudi Arabia on how to implement the New York Declaration, to ask the Palestinians and other regional actors to recognize Israel as the Jewish people’s homeland (as the 2020 Abraham Accords did), and to demand that Palestinian leaders be held accountable to their obligation under international law to prevent their territories from being used as a base to attack Israel. If they do so, they may well find that the momentum toward recognition has advantages for Israel. The recognizing states will have to step up, too, by making their security guarantees concrete and by helping shape a Palestinian state that does not threaten its neighbors and dignifies its people by providing functioning institutions and proper services.
LEARNED REACTION
The state of Israel was established by a UN General Assembly resolution, which theoretically means that Israel cannot selectively accept the legitimacy that created it while rejecting a Palestinian state formed under the same framework. But Israeli opposition to a Palestinian state has only hardened since Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack. A June 2025 Pew survey found that only 21 percent of Israelis agreed that “peaceful coexistence with a Palestinian state is possible,” the lowest proportion since the polling organization first asked the question, in 2013. A September 2024 joint poll by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) and Tel Aviv University’s International Program in Conflict Resolution and Mediation found that most Israelis believed that if a Palestinian state were established, terrorist attacks on Israel would persist or increase.


After October 7, Israelis have become extremely risk-averse and reluctant to make territorial concessions, especially given the ongoing terrorism threat from the Palestinian territories and the PA’s dysfunction. Even centrist leaders who persistently oppose Netanyahu have come out strongly against recognition. Benny Gantz, a centrist retired army general who served in Netanyahu’s war cabinet, lamented that recognition now “ultimately only emboldens Hamas, extends the war, distances the prospects of a hostage deal, and sends a clear message of support to Iran and its proxies.” On September 21, Yair Lapid, Israel’s opposition leader, said that “the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state by Britain, Australia, and Canada is a diplomatic disaster, a harmful step, and a reward for terror.”
Many Israelis, with some justification, share the sentiment that the timing of the recent recognitions rewards Hamas—a view that Hamas officials have encouraged. On August 2, Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official, told Al Jazeera that “the initiative by several countries to recognize a Palestinian state is one of the fruits of October 7. We proved that victory over Israel is not impossible, and our weapons are a symbol of Palestinian dignity.”
Beyond the trouble with this narrative, Israelis have other valid concerns. Recognition will fundamentally alter the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip under international law, committing recognizing states to review their agreements with Israel to ensure that they do not violate their obligations to the state of Palestine. A wide range of Israeli military operations, including its thousands of annual raids to arrest terrorists or destroy weapons in Palestinian territory, could be recast from counterterrorism to violations of the sovereignty of a UN member. Before September, nearly 150 UN member countries already recognized a Palestinian state. But adding France and the United Kingdom to that list—two permanent Security Council members—as well as G-7 countries such as Australia and Canada may well subject Israel to much more scrutiny and pressure by lawmakers and civil society groups, including substantial legal challenges at international courts. Germany, Italy, and even the United States may eventually feel that they have no choice but to follow their Security Council peers’ lead. It will also strengthen Palestinians’ standing in international forums and pave the way for Palestine’s transition from a permanent observer at the UN to a full member—which would make its status as a state unquestionable despite Israel’s objections.
LOSS LEADER
In the near term, recognition is likely to hurt Palestinians the most. By the standard definition of a state, Palestine clearly does not fully qualify at present: although it has partially functioning institutions, it has no defined territory it truly controls, no monopoly on the use of force, no independent economy, and no coherent governance. Whatever nominal Palestinian state exists on paper thanks to the recognition announcements will have no real viability—and recognition’s aftermath may well further undermine the PA’s ability to govern even in the limited territory it supposedly controls.
The PA is teetering on the brink of insolvency. Public schools in the West Bank have postponed the start of the school year and are now only open three days a week, affecting more than 600,000 children. The PA has been forced to slash the salaries of its public servants by as much as 50 percent and to delay payments to private-sector contractors. Government departments such as the Ministry of Health provide only partial services. The West Bank’s economy has shrunk to less than a sixth of its 2022 size, and unemployment stands at over 30 percent. The PA enjoys little popularity among its people: a May PCPSR poll found that 81 percent of Palestinians want President Mahmoud Abbas to resign and that 69 percent believe that the PA will not succeed in accomplishing the reforms necessary to govern.
This week’s recognitions do nothing, in practice, to give the PA more capacity or shore it up against Israeli aggression. Instead, they put Palestinians even more squarely in the crosshairs of Israeli officials seeking to render Palestinian statehood impossible. On September 18, Smotrich threatened Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that if the Israeli government does not annex the West Bank in response to the recognitions, he will use his authority as finance minister to fully collapse the PA. Speaking at a September 20 event at Maale Adumim, a large settlement near Jerusalem, Netanyahu declared, “We are going to fulfill our promise that there will be no Palestinian state. This place belongs to us.”
LONE DANGER
The consequences for Israel, however, go well beyond the symbolic and cannot easily be neutralized with annexations. This wave of recognitions will likely increase anti-Israel sentiment globally, accelerating divestments and boycotts. And the very governments that sought to address domestic opposition to Israeli policy by announcing recognitions will come under more pressure to impose formal sanctions. The European Union is Israel’s largest investor, contributing nearly twice as much annually to the Israeli economy as the United States does; the main destination for Israeli investments; and Israel’s largest trading partner.


Some European institutions have already divested from Israeli enterprises: in August, for instance, Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund divested from Caterpillar and five Israeli banks, citing an “unacceptable risk” that its investments were contributing to human rights violations. Countries with more investments in Israel, such as France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, could follow suit. Many economic ties between EU member states and Israel are governed by the 2000 EU-Israel Association Agreement, which can be canceled only by unanimous consensus, an unlikely outcome given Hungary’s continued support for Israel. A European Commission proposal in mid-September to partially suspend the agreement—which required only the backing of a majority of member states—was vetoed by Germany and Italy.
Yet the trajectory of European opinion that the recognition wave represents could push Germany and Italy to lift their veto. In such a scenario, Israel could lose its free trade agreement with the EU as well as its access to the $100 billion Horizon Europe research program, the EU’s flagship fund for research and innovation. Israel is a major beneficiary of the program, but this year to date, its approval rates for projects with Israeli collaborators has already dropped by 68.5 percent. In May, David Harel, the president of Israel’s Academy of Sciences and Humanities, said that if Israel were excluded entirely it would be a “death sentence for Israeli science.”

 For Israel, the consequences of recognition go beyond the symbolic.
The alienation of Israeli academics represents a broader trend. The country’s athletes are less and less able to compete with their peers abroad. The executive committee of the Union of European Football Associations is expected to vote soon on suspending Israel’s national team and all of its clubs from its competitions, which would exclude Israelis from a leading venue for its favorite sport. Cultural institutions face equally severe pressure—pressure that will only increase after this week’s recognitions. In early September, the Flanders Festival Ghent, in Belgium, canceled a performance by the Munich Philharmonic solely because its conductor, Lahav Shani—who has called for peace in Gaza—also directs the Israel Philharmonic; over 4,000 actors and filmmakers have pledged not to cooperate with Israeli institutions.
It may seem trivial to outsiders, but the growing possibility that Israel could be ejected from the Eurovision Song Contest hits Israelis especially hard. The competition is one of Israel’s most cherished events of the year, and Israelis take pride in their exceptional record: Israel has won four times, and the fact that an Israeli contestant reached the 2025 final felt enormously comforting to Israelis, reassuring them that their artists could still be loved in countries where protests against their government are common. But Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Spain have all threatened to boycott Eurovision 2026 if Israel participates. The recent recognitions and Israel’s aggressive counterreaction may well push more countries to issue similar threats.
At a Finance Ministry conference last week, Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel is entering “a kind of isolation.” But he has sought to claim that the country could manage this isolation, suggesting that Israel can adopt an economy with “autarkic features” and become a “super-Sparta.” Netanyahu appears to have forgotten that Israel’s economic success owes much to Oslo’s peace dividend and that Israel has become an export-driven economy that relies on the tech sector and a highly educated, globally connected workforce. Its continued success depends on thriving relationships with the rest of the world. This is why Israel’s founding father, David Ben-Gurion, famously said in 1955 that “Israel is not destined to become a new Sparta.” Regardless of Israel’s military engagements, he continued, “we must not be distracted” from the fact that “our ultimate goal in our relations with our neighbors is peace and coexistence.”
GIFT HORSE
After the diplomatic circus at the UN subsides, there will still be an opportunity to make lemonade from lemons—if Israel and other countries turn their attention back to the New York Declaration. That declaration’s objective was to avoid the pitfalls of previous unsuccessful diplomatic initiatives by proposing time-bound, tangible steps toward a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict within a regional framework that shuns Hamas and incentivizes Arab states to play major roles. Unfortunately, the escalatory rhetoric and mutual threats surrounding recognition took attention off these measures. But they could provide the Israeli government with an off-ramp to end its war in Gaza, which is unpopular among Israelis.
The Israeli government has long insisted that five conditions must be met before its military operations can halt: Hamas must be disarmed, all living and deceased hostages must be returned, Gaza must be demilitarized, Israel must retain security control over the Gaza Strip, and an alternative civilian administration run by neither Hamas nor the PA should be established. The New York Declaration is perfectly aligned with Israel’s first three goals, and it implicitly accepts that in the near term, Israel will maintain peripheral security control over Gaza and that Hamas will not return to power. Its vision for PA authority over Gaza is conditioned on reforms that would make the PA a more trusted neighbor than it is today.
In reality, the gap between what Israel wants and what international actors hope for can be bridged. France, Saudi Arabia, and the governments that endorsed the New York Declaration should immediately start taking practical steps to operationalize its proposed measures, such as by designing a mechanism to disarm Hamas, training a multinational security force that could properly monitor and enforce a cease-fire, acquiring real commitments from international players to stabilize and reconstruct Gaza, and developing a concrete plan to deradicalize Palestinian armed-resistance movements. In addition, the governments that signed the New York Declaration should invest in more effective marketing to the Israeli public. They need to demonstrate why their proposal offers a viable alternative to the Israeli government’s current zero-sum approach to the Palestinians. They also should seek to bring the United States on board in their September 23 meeting with Trump, which is expected to cover a post-war vision for Gaza.


Israel, for its part, has shown that it can be pragmatic when it needs to be. For instance, during the six-week cease-fire in January 2025, it allowed PA security forces carrying the Palestinian flag to patrol the Rafah border. Now is the time to be even more pragmatic. This week’s recognitions are a fait accompli. Whether even more powerful states will recognize Palestine is a question of when, not if. And Israel will face an isolation that its people cannot survive in the long term unless it accepts that the PA will have to play some role in ending the war in Gaza.
In fact, recognition could have advantages for Israel. If the international community begins to treat the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a dispute between legally equal entities rather than between an occupier and an occupied people, that could force the UN and other international forums (including international courts), as well as the Palestinian leadership, to recognize that Israel does face a security threat from the Palestinian territories. It will also clarify the obligations that Palestinian leaders have to abide by international law, prevent their territories from being used as a base to attack Israel, and stop Hamas’s terrorist activities.
In the Middle East, if you do not take a seat at the table you will likely end up on the menu. Instead of flat-out rejecting the rest of the world’s attempts to intervene, Israel should make it clear that it accepts key components of the New York Declaration, join discussions on how to implement them, seek conversations on elements of concern, and ask for critical additional measures such as a recognition of Jews’ right to self-determination within Israel. Only then can the course of events in the Middle East change from unilateral recognition, regional fragmentation, and international isolation for Israel to regional integration and enhanced security for Palestinians and Israelis alike.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Ever since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House, officials across Europe have scrambled to craft a peace deal that could work for Ukraine. They know by now that, at the moment, Russian President Vladimir Putin is not interested in stopping his offensives, and they fear that shifting American priorities may leave Ukraine without a critical source of support. As a result, they are racing to find a way to provide Kyiv with security guarantees that could deter Russia and allow for an armistice.
In conversations about security guarantees, officials have tended to focus on a handful of measures: placing a small number of European troops in Ukraine to shore up the country’s defense (so-called reassurance forces), levying additional sanctions against Russia, and providing Ukraine with more weapons, including conventional ones. They have also mused about committing themselves, on paper, to Ukraine’s defense. Two of these actions—more weapons and sanctions—could take place before any cease-fire. The rest would go into effect only after the fighting ends.
These proposals have certain virtues. But by themselves, they are not enough to guarantee Ukraine’s security. Since the start of Russia’s invasion in 2022, Putin has been transparent about his objective—the destruction of Ukraine as an independent nation—and has subjected many people to almost unimaginable suffering in order to achieve it. He will not be deterred by words, a smattering of NATO troops, or by more agony (including if it affects Russians). In fact, he will not stop the war unless Russian troops literally cannot advance any further.
Right now, some U.S. and European analysts are pessimistic that Ukraine can completely halt Russia’s aggression, and understandably so. NATO countries, after all, have been arming Kyiv for years, and Moscow keeps making incremental gains. But Ukraine need not destroy every element of the Russian military to achieve strategic neutralization—stripping away the enemy of its ability to achieve its objectives. And the conflict has recently changed in ways that have made it easier to freeze. Today, the war is being fought less with traditional military equipment and more with newer, cheaper technologies that Ukraine helped pioneer. In fact, Ukraine has already done a great deal of what’s needed to deter Russia for good. But Europe must stop focusing on which traditional capabilities it should provide to Ukraine or on establishing written security guarantees. Instead, the continent should get serious about investing more in Ukraine’s war effort by flooding the country with more advanced technologies. It needs to invest heavily in the country’s sophisticated defense industry. It must cooperate more directly with Kyiv on matters of military manufacturing and on air defenses. Such measures will indeed be daunting, but not any more than NATO’s original effort to help Ukraine. And ultimately, Europe has little choice. They are the only way to bring peace.
WORDS FAIL
Throughout the past century, powerful states have sought to provide security guarantees to weaker partners. Those guarantees, however, have only conferred a real benefit when they created tangible shields. During the Cold War, NATO effectively deterred the Soviet Union because the United States situated substantial forces and firepower on the continent, including some nuclear weapons. In Asia, the mutual defense treaty between South Korea and the United States works to deter a North Korean invasion because tens of thousands of American troops remain on the peninsula, where they jointly plan and train with their South Korean partners. In the 1930s, by contrast, the British and the French backed their pledge to defend Poland with nothing but rhetoric; as a result, Nazi Germany felt free to invade the country. Likewise, the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which a consortium of states (including Russia) promised to protect Ukraine’s sovereignty if it gave up its nuclear weapons, did nothing to stop Russia from invading its neighbor multiple times because it offered no military resources to Kyiv.


After Russia launched its first invasion of Ukraine, sending troops into Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk in 2014, the United States and Europe did begin supplying Kyiv with defensive and, eventually, offensive assistance. But it was only in late 2021, after it became clear that Russia aimed to invade the entire country, that NATO states got somewhat serious about arming Ukraine. That support, however, proved effective: rather than quickly conquering Ukraine, as much of the world expected, Russia quickly became bogged down.
In fact, in some domains, Ukraine has managed to functionally defeat its enemy. Consider the battle over the Black Sea. From the outset of its full-scale invasion, Russia sought to strangle Ukraine’s economy by cutting off its maritime access. Moscow’s Black Sea Fleet blockaded Ukrainian ports, occupied Snake Island, and threatened Odessa, the country’s main coastal city. Allied attempts to negotiate a partial end to this blockade failed. But by the fall of 2023, the Ukrainian military succeeded in breaking it with naval drones, precision missiles, and air-launched bombs—a substantial portion of which came from the United States. (Ukrainian-made weapons, of course, were also essential to this victory.) Although these strikes only destroyed part of Russia’s fleet, Kyiv made it impossible for Putin’s ships to sail near Ukraine’s main ports, and Moscow was left with no choice but to move most of its fleet to the east.
Ukraine has had success in the air, as well. Russia began its 2022 war confident it could establish air dominance within days, allowing it to quickly march on Kyiv. Instead, Ukraine’s innovative defenses have made it impossible for Russia to achieve superiority. In an air denial operation undertaken in the first days of the invasion, now known as Ghost of Kyiv, Ukraine used its limited air capabilities to intercept many Russian fighter jets and effectively push these planes out of its airspace. During its more complex 2025 “Spiderweb” operations, Ukraine has used innovative uncrewed systems to destroy a substantial portion of Russia’s strategic aviation fleet, or the aircraft Russia uses to launch numerous cruise missiles at all areas of Ukraine. Kyiv has not been able to make its skies safe enough for commercial air-traffic transit, and it experiences constant missile and long-range drone attacks. But it has been able to force Russian manned aircraft to operate tens of kilometers from the frontlines, launching glide bombs rather than conducting close air support operations to help ground forces.
Fully liberating Ukraine would take more than just such measures, at least for now, and it would require considerable additional capabilities. But strategic neutralization is attainable without waging a multidecade war of attrition. To obviate Russia’s threat, Ukraine does not need to kill off every Russian soldier. Instead, it can paralyze the military by targeting essential functions such as logistics, coordination, mobility, and firepower. In this way, it can follow a template pioneered by Israel, which neutralized Egypt’s far larger air force in 1967 not by destroying every aircraft but by taking out many of them and eliminating its runways and command systems. As a result, Israel preserved its existence without annihilating vast opposition forces.
BIGGER AND BETTER
Ukraine is closer to paralyzing Russia than most people think. Russia’s jets do still strike Ukrainian targets, albeit from a great distance, and Russian ground forces continue to seize small chunks of territory. But with drones, remote mines, precision artillery, and constant surveillance, Ukraine has transformed large stretches of the front into persistent kill zones: areas where forces find it nearly impossible to maneuver without being detected and then immediately hit. Only by throwing thousands upon thousands of troops at Ukrainian targets can Russia advance through a few of these regions. If Ukraine can widen these kill zones—by surveilling more territory and striking behind Russia’s current forward lines—and deny Russia the ability to mass men and materiel in its rear, Russian formations will be unable to generate any momentum. Future offensives by Russia would then become strategically futile, and thus not worth attempting.
To succeed, however, Ukraine will need more drones and high-tech weapons. And helping Kyiv get these systems will necessitate that NATO change its presumptions and priorities. When the war broke out, it made sense for the United States and Europe to pump Ukraine full of traditional weapons systems. But as the operational environment has evolved, many legacy systems have become largely obsolete. For instance, some sophisticated assault weapons, such as tanks, are now disabled almost as soon as they enter the kill zone by simpler, cheaper uncrewed aerial vehicles. They therefore do little to help either party.
Ukraine’s allies must refocus their attention on helping Ukraine innovate and integrate new technologies at the scale needed to stop Russia. These allies have what they need. Europe alone has financial resources, scientific capabilities, and an industrial base that Russia cannot match. If the continent uses these capacities alongside Ukraine, it could help the Ukrainian military develop and produce many advanced and affordable precise, long-range systems—including missiles and uncrewed aerial vehicles—as well as communications gear, positioning and targeting equipment, air defenses, and electronic warfare systems.



 The security guarantees that matter are the ones that practically shape the battlefield.
The continent has already taken meaningful steps in this direction. The European Union has launched several programs designed to channel money into Ukrainian defense-industrial factories. Kyiv has also forged bilateral deals with a variety of countries to scale up its drone and ammunition production. But these partnerships must be expanded dramatically. Europe must, of course, spend more on Ukraine and increase its own production of material. But it must also focus on speeding up design, testing, and scaling.
There are other ways Europe can assist Kyiv. Perhaps the most important is a European Sky Shield for Ukraine: an initiative proposed by a group of international and Ukrainian military experts. In it, a collection of European states would establish a no-fly zone, first over western Ukrainian territory and later over central Ukraine. Participating states would mobilize roughly 120 combat aircraft, which would fly from European bases and shoot down missiles and drones over the covered territory. In addition to safeguarding Ukraine’s infrastructure and economy—by, for example, shielding Ukrainian nuclear plants and export corridors—it would free Ukraine’s own air force to concentrate on the eastern front. The model, which is based on the air policing missions Europe has conducted over the Baltics for 20 years, carries some escalation risks. But Russia is unlikely to interfere, since direct, air-to-air combat would not work to its advantage.
NATO states will also have to continue supplying Kyiv with some traditional weapons. Ukraine will need more F-16 fighter jets to defend its skies. It still requires long-range missiles, like the U.S. Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and British and French Storm Shadow and SCALP missiles, to hit the many Russian logistics hubs, command centers, stockpiles, and troop formations located beyond the battlefield. Ukraine’s allies should also earmark certain stockpiles of ammunition, drones, and spare parts housed in eastern Europe for Ukraine, so that they are never again vulnerable to political delays in Washington or European capitals. And the United States must continue providing Kyiv with military intelligence, which has been indispensable to tracking Russian troop movements and missile strikes. Such high-end enablers will remain cornerstones of any meaningful security guarantees.
But tanks or other legacy equipment would be of little use on their own. Giving Ukraine another paper commitment to its security, even one modeled on NATO’s Article 5, as some European states have discussed, would do nothing. And without tangible support that’s tailored to today’s Ukrainian battlefield, even European reassurance forces would be of dubious value. Unless NATO countries decide to station large numbers of combat-ready troops or send over instructors, these deployments would have the main effect of being expensive and politically risky within their home countries. The troops are unlikely to stop, or be spared from, Russia’s military.
HOLD THE LINE
After more than 11 years of war, the lesson from Ukraine is clear: the security guarantees that matter are the ones that practically shape the battlefield. If the goal is to make Russian aggression futile, then the United States and Europe must channel resources into capabilities that deny, disrupt, and paralyze the Russian military. Nothing less will succeed.
Giving Ukraine what it needs does not only help Kyiv. If Putin’s military is not stopped somewhere in Ukraine, it may march on a NATO member. Putin has made no secret of his desire to reverse the collapse of the Soviet Union and establish Russian dominance over Europe’s east. Over the last several weeks, he has floated drones and fighter jets over NATO’s boundary in a clear test of the alliance’s integrity. At a minimum, more of these provocations are likely to happen unless NATO helps Ukraine neutralize Russia’s military.
The EU seems aware of this. In European Defence—Readiness 2030, a report published in early 2025, the European Commission explicitly framed Ukraine’s survival as central to Europe’s own security. It called for a “steel porcupine” strategy—or fortifying Ukraine so that future Russian offensives fail by design—and investing in Ukraine’s defense industry as part of creating a shared European capacity. But the EU and NATO must do more to help Ukraine firmly prevail over Russia’s technologies and deny Moscow any further battlefield victories. Its members need to plow more resources and in-kind technology contributions into Ukraine’s defense industry. They must help Kyiv quickly develop and massively scale up new systems. Then, and only then, will Europe be able to breathe.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[For the first time, a woman is at the helm of Deutsche Bahn. Evelyn Palla must combat delays, train cancellations and low morale.

Delays, often several hours long, missed connections, train cancellations and dirty stations. Broken tracks and signal boxes, leading to endless track work. Poor service on trains, dirty toilets. Deutsche Bahn has been in crisis for a long time.
Now, everything is supposed to get better — with a new boss, a realistic schedule and a focus on passengers' expectations that trains run comfortably and reliably from A to B as scheduled.
On Monday in Berlin, Transport Minister Patrick Schnieder introduced his choice for Deutsche Bahn's new CEO, Evelyn Palla, and presented his plan to improve Germany's railway.
"Today, we are taking up the baton for a new era. An era in which we will once again focus on what we do best: running trains, the railway as the lifeline of this country," Palla, a 51-year-old Austrian national, told the press. She is to replace railway boss Richard Lutz, who has been at the helm of the state-owned company since 2017.
'Many people equate the dysfunctionality of the railways with the dysfunctionality of our state,' warned Transport Minister Patrick SchniederImage: Fabian Sommer/dpa/picture-alliance

Lutz had repeatedly warned of the dilapidated state of the railways, but for a long time, politicians paid little heed to his warnings. One of his most memorable and often-repeated statements was: "We are carrying three times as much traffic as in 1990 on virtually the same network."
Palla has been on the Deutsche Bahn board since 2019 and has been responsible for regional transport since 2022, managing to whip it into shape. In fact, local transport has recently been in the black and has attracted more customers.
Union representatives of the 235,000 Deutsche Bahn employees have expressed appreciation for Palla herself taking and passing the test to get her locomotive driver's license last year. "I wanted to know what it feels like to sit in the driver's seat. And also to understand what our employees do every day and what our core business is all about," Palla said at the time.


Current punctuality targets 'nowhere near achievable'
Schnieder began the press conference in Berlin with a critique of the previous Deutsche Bahn management, describing its target of making 75 to 80% of long-distance trains run on time again by 2027 as "nowhere near achievable." Schnieder has set a new target: From 2029, 70% of trains should once again be on time. This would give the railways more time to renovate their dilapidated tracks and signal boxes, some of which have not been repaired for decades.
Current figures prove Schnieder right: in the first six months of this year, only 63.4% of long-distance trains in Germany were on time, and in July this figure fell to just 56.1%. In other words, over 40% of long-distance trains did not arrive on time during the most important travel month of the year. By comparison, in neighboring countries Denmark and the Netherlands, around 90% of trains run on time, and in Switzerland, the figure is as high as 99%.
"Many people equate the dysfunctionality of the railways with the dysfunctionality of our state," the transport minister remarked, adding, "I find that extremely dangerous."
Germany's national rail network covers around 33,500 kilometers (20,800 miles) of tracks. As a state-owned company, the operator Deutsche Bahn is dependent on subsidies from the federal government, which critics say has invested far too little in infrastructure over the last few decades.
In fact, some tracks, junctures and even signal boxes date back to the 19th century. Many systems are completely worn out, almost beyond repair, and now so outdated that they are unusable for digitally controlled rail operations, which are to become standard.

Schnieder promised that the new railway management will stick to its plan to completely renovate around 40 important routes by 2036. The busy connection between the capital Berlin and Hamburg in the north of the country is currently being upgraded. Work began at the start of August, and is scheduled for completion in April. It's estimated to cost €2.2 billion ($2.6 bn). And this brings us to the next point: money.
Billions in investment
Last year alone, around 2,000 kilometers of tracks and 2,000 switches were replaced. Work was also carried out on around 150 bridges, and around 1,000 stations and stops were renovated, at a total cost of around €16.4 billion.
The railway will receive many more billions of euros from the €500 billion special fund for infrastructure that the federal government intends to borrow in order to whip the country into shape over the coming years. Schnieder said he was still working on a piece of legislation to this effect, but that he intended to present figures in the fall showing exactly how much of the new windfall Deutsche Bahn would receive. This is because a large amount of money from the fund is also intended to accelerate the country's digitization.
But even as the new railway officials in Berlin were answering questions from journalists, news was making the rounds that train service in the north of the country had been severely restricted due to an overhead line disruption. ICE trains between Hamburg and Berlin, Germany's largest and second-largest cities, which were already being rerouted and taking longer due to the aforementioned construction work, had been completely canceled.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Leo Neugebauer delivered Germany's only gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo. The US college student say it's the perfect finish to a "roller-coaster ride."

"I feel fantastic," Leo Neugebauer told the crowd over the PA system in the National Stadium in Tokyo on Sunday. Just moments earlier, the German decathlete had dragged himself over the finish line in the final event of the decathlon, the 1,500 meters. He staggered through the final few meters before collapsing to the ground as the new world decathlon champion.
Neugebauer was so exhausted that he briefly accepted the offer of taking a seat in a wheelchair. However, he soon stood up again – taking to the podium to receive the gold medal, fulfilling a long-held dream.

'Roller-coaster ride'
This was the 25-year-old's first major title, and it came a year after he'd won Olympic silver at the Paris Games.
"I can honestly say that this season has really been a rollercoaster ride; I didn't expect to win gold. I'm mega happy," Neugebauer told German public television.
The road to this success was indeed a bumpy one. At the German Championships in Dresden at the beginning of August, Neugebauer only competed in six disciplines in order to focus on his technique. At a key decathlon meeting in Austria in June, he had only managed a fifth-place finish.

After last year's Olympic silver, Neugebauer had to learn to deal with the increased pressure of expectation and media attention – something he said made this season "very busy," with little time to relax.
There had been considerable doubt as to whether he would be in top form in time for the World Athletics Championships. The javelin had been giving him particular problems – but he overcame them just in time for Tokyo.
Neugebauer hadn't been the favorite for the title, but the German record holder was in top form in Japan. With a stellar performance in the discus throw (56.15 meters) and, for him, very strong results in the javelin (64.34 meters) and in the 1,500 meters (4:31.89 minutes), he sealed the win in dramatic fashion.


Finally, a German gold medal
Neugebauer prevailed by just 20 points over silver medalist Ayden Owens-Delerme of Puerto Rico – the narrowest margin of victory in the history of decathlon at the World Championships. Kyle Garland of the USA, who was leading for a while, secured bronze, while another German, 2019 champion Niklas Kaul, finished fourth after a strong finish.
Neugebauer gave Germany their first and only gold medal on the final day of the World Championships – with the third-best decathlon performance of his career.
Benefitting from the US college sports system
Neugebauer's rise to join the world's elite in the sport is due in no small part to his move to the United States. The Stuttgart native has been studying and training at the University of Texas at Austin for several years. There, he profits from state-of-the-art training facilities, an experienced coaching team, and the opportunity to combine his studies with elite college competition.

"I wanted to develop myself both athletically and personally," Neugebauer once said when asked about his decision to move to the United States.
In Austin, he not only made great strides athletically, but also learned how to handle pressure and compete at the highest level. Competing at the college level has toughened him up – and made him a world champion.
Error-prone competitors
After Kaul and Torsten Voss, who won gold for East Germany in Rome in 1987, Neugebauer is only the third world decathlon champion from Germany. Neugebauer was also helped by the misfortunes of his top rival, Sander Skotheim of Norway.
Skotheim, who had arrived in Japan as the world No 1, stumbled over the hurdles at the start of the second day of competition, then knocked over an obstacle with his hands – and was thus disqualified.

Many of the other contenders had their own struggles – including Neugebauer who had complained of knee problems at the end of the first day of competition.
However, his perseverance and his mindset of taking things "one discipline at a time" was rewarded, as it was Neugebauer who best managed to limit his errors.
Still just 28 for 2028 Games
Having won World Championship gold and Olympic silver, what could be next for Neugebauer?
"I have no idea," he said with a laugh.
"I can approach the upcoming seasons with a relaxed attitude as I've already achieved so much, and I'm really looking forward to it."
The next obvious goal has to be Olympic gold at the Los Angeles Games in 2028. By then, he'll still be just 28 – a prime age for a decathlete.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[If Berlin were to become a climate-neutral city within the next 25 years, daily life could be radically different.
    While Berlin is already very green, urban planners need to prepare the city for a hotter future Image: Wolfgang Maria Weber/dpa/picture alliance    
Foreword: Though the character Emilia is fictional, this vision of life in Berlin in 2050 is shaped by current scientific insights and modeled projections for urban development.
Emilia wakes to a brilliant glare bouncing off her neighbor's solar panels. She only moved to Treptow, a neighborhood in the southeast of Berlin last week, and still needs curtains. She makes a mental note to check the nearest secondhand shop.
She gets up and slips into a shirt she picked up at a clothes swap store and a skirt she inherited from her mother. It's a bit worn in places, but that's just an opportunity to patch it and make it her own.
Like most people she knows, she enjoys creating her own styles. 
It's hard for her to imagine the fast-fashion days her mom sometimes talks about, when people used to buy clothes they might only wear once before discarding them. Or sometimes not at all. A lot of that ended up being transported across oceans to be dumped.

Emilia shakes her head at the thought of it, puts on rented earrings and takes a selfie to send to her girlfriend Sophia, who has already left for work. She is a solar panel installer, a profession that is in high demand these days.
Emilia is likely to find work easily once she's finished her studies in sustainable fashion.
Green spaces, trains and city river swimming
It's warm outside, but not as bad as the July heat wave when people often stayed indoors within reach of cooling systems — small window heat pumps for older apartment buildings and low-energy designs and insulation in new blocks.
Emilia often gets up at sunrise for a quick dip in the Spree River — much to her parents' dismay. They still remember what it was like when they were children, before extensive sewage prevention, enhanced filtration and UV treatment improved the water quality.

It's not the only difference of opinion on water use. Waiting for her train, Emilia recalls how many conversations it took to convince her parents to start harvesting rain — more than she can count. But during the recent drought, her dad proudly announced how everyone in their block on the other side of the city was using stored rainwater to do their laundry, flush their toilets and water the plants that cover their building.
Residents feel a shared sense of responsibility to take care of the plants, understanding how important they are in helping to keep the city cool and reduce CO2 emissions.
Emilia's parents are in their early 50s and most people of their generation agree that the city is a better place to live in now, despite the storms, downpours and heat waves that have increased with rising temperatures. There's a sense of owning the progress they have all helped to make.
Emila finds a seat on the underground, which is busy but spacious enough not to feel crowded. Berlin's transport system has become more efficient in the last few years, with a mix of e-scooters, trams, subways, trains and bikes. People once had to pay to stand in hot, cramped trains, but nowadays, they can get around for free in temperature-controlled carriages, or bike along designated tree-lined lanes.
The underground emerges from a tunnel and Emilia looks out of the window at a long stretch of greenery that used to be roads. In the past decades, one-third of the city's roads have been unsealed to help recharge groundwater when it rains. It's hard to imagine that there used to be a million cars driving where there are now parks and community gardens.
Growing mangoes in city offices 
Equipped with doors that close automatically, reflective walls, shutters and good insulation, the university, like many public buildings, is cool. Even the canteen where Emilia tucks into the leftovers of her 3D-printed steak and veggies from the meal she cooked her parents last night.
Lab-grown meat can taste like conventional meat Image: Upside Foods

Like most people, her mom switched to a largely plant-based diet a long time ago, but her dad has been harder to convert. He still eats meat or fish once a week, but has come around to the idea of making sure it is always sourced locally. 
Last night, he ate his high-tech steak made from lab-grown animal cells without even realizing it wasn't from an actual cow. And much to Emilia's amusement, he couldn't taste the difference. Neither can she. Not that she remembers the last time she ate a conventional steak.
She dips it into the sauce she made from mangoes that are now grown in Berlin. Weird to think of a piece of fruit traveling halfway around the world to be eaten. Especially since Emilia has never been on a plane herself. And she can't imagine she ever will, not in a world where she can travel the 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) from Berlin to Helsinki by direct high-speed train in five hours.
When her dad was her age, that journey took a whole day by road or train with plenty of stops along the way, making planes a popular choice. Nowadays, if people do fly, it's on planes powered by green fuel or electricity, and largely only when they leave the continent.
But back to the mangoes. They're grown in containers in old offices converted for food production. In the last two decades, urban agriculture has blossomed with rooftop farms, vertical systems and community greenhouses all over the city.
Being invested in the food they grow has made people less wasteful, as has the zero-waste movement and tips on how to use things like crusts of bread, old fruit and imperfect vegetables. And any waste is largely fed to animals.


Empowered by innovation 
When Emilia gets back from university in the late afternoon, her flat is the perfect temperature. The smart home system is programmed to cool the space in the summer and heat it in the winter, with a geothermal heat pump for the entire building. The city's energy system works efficiently. What's more, Berlin's expanded rollout of solar panels and wind parks and regional energy sharing means it now runs on 100% renewables.
She remembers when she was little, how there would sometimes be lights on when they weren't needed. But now people have become more aware of energy consumption and the resource use. She takes a water-saving shower, remembering how she used to have a bath instead.
Even her grandmother has had the tub taken out of her bathroom and now keeps it in her garden to collect rainwater. Necessity is the motor for change, she'd said at the time.
Showered and dressed, she flops onto the secondhand sofa and reads a message from Sophia, who is stopping off to get some beer brewed from recycled bread. Emilia sends a heart. Not just because her partner is on her way back to their shared home with her favorite drink, but because she understands that the city could just as easily not have become what it is today.
She has heard enough to know that when she was born 25 years ago, there was an urgent need to act on climate change. She feels a surge of gratitude for the activists, policy advocates, journalists and entrepreneurs who refused to stop pushing for change.
She has often thought about how hard it must have been to swim against the tide, but also how satisfying it was when governments began to support initiatives and to legislate on decarbonizing economies. And how exciting it must have been back then to see mindsets and then the city itself shift to become something new.
And not just Berlin, in fact, but the whole world. As countries experimented with local solutions and drew inspiration from each other, community action spread, gradually translating to a collective and dramatic global turnaround. 
Emilia looks out of the window to where the sun is slowly sinking on the day, feeding the last of its rays into the solar panels, and she smiles at what she sees.
Afterword: This is just one possible version of 2050 if the world acts to slow climate change.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Decreased libido isn't listed on most birth control pill information leaflets. Yet, research shows it can affect libido — just not for everyone.
    The pill: What if you take it because you want more sex with your partner (without a condom) but end up losing your libido?   Image: Lea Albrecht/DW   
Apeksha Shetty, an Indian woman based in Vienna, went on the pill for hormonal reasons. One of the benefits, she thought, was being able to have sex with her steady partner, without having to worry about pregnancy. "We were initially very happy that we could have unprotected sex."
But things didn't go as expected. The pill Shetty was prescribed stopped her periods entirely, and with it, she told DW, her sex drive vanished.
"I went back to the doctor and told him I didn't want to live my life like this," said Shetty. "I told him I was young — I have an attractive partner and want to have sex with him."
Shetty's story is not unique. DW spoke with at least half a dozen women from diverse backgrounds, including in Africa and Asia, the Middle East and Europe. All told us they had followed medical advice while on the pill. And most said doctors had not informed them that the pill could lower their libido, and that there was no mention of the side effect in the packaging.
The relationship between the birth control pill and women's libido has always been complicated. The pill ushered in a new era of sexual autonomy, yet for some women, the very synthetic hormones that prevented pregnancy may have also suppressed libido.
Sexual autonomy, yes. But at what cost? 
The first contraceptive pill was approved in 1960 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was an unprecedented step in medicine and family planning, giving women the ability to control their fertility. Women could have sex without the fear of an unwanted pregnancy.
Over time, the pill also became associated with greater sexual freedom and bodily autonomy, especially for women. But while it's 99% effective as contraception, the pill is not a safe way to protect yourself against sexually transmitted infections.

Case study: From 'horny' to zero
Mariel*, who is from Cyprus and based in the Netherlands, started taking the pill eight years ago when she was 20. Before she took the pill, her libido was high — she was often "horny," as she put it.
"I wanted to have more, safer sex," Mariel told DW. "But most of my sexual intercourse in the beginning was not driven by libido, but more because I could, almost regardless of my libido." Only later did Mariel realize that the pill had dampened her desire.
A large review of 36 studies involving more than 13,000 women in 2013 found that around 15% of participants reported a drop in libido while using the pill. 
But since then, few studies have attempted to explain why, and the results that do exist appear to be mixed. That may have something to do with the fact that the studies lack comparability — while the pill commonly consists of the hormones estrogen and progestin, there are variations in how much of each goes into the pill, and that can lead to varying effects and side effects.
In 2016, a clinical trial involving 340 women randomly assigned participants to either the pill or a placebo. Overall, the participants did not report significant changes in their sexual activity, but women on the pill did report lower levels of desire, arousal and pleasure.
Researchers believe this may be due to the pill's effect on testosterone. The pill increases levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which binds to so-called free testosterone in the body. Free testosterone gives you sexual desire. When SHBG binds to free testosterone, it effectively takes it out of action and reduces libido as a result.


Case study: Dryness, pain and psychology
For some, the pill's negative side effects are not limited to desire. They can also affect physical arousal, particularly lubrication. 
That's something that DW journalist and former psychologist Shristi Pal has experienced firsthand. Pal, who spoke to DW in a private capacity, said she went on the pill to regulate her hormones, but noticed both vaginal dryness and a loss of libido.
"It was also psychological," Pal said. "You're afraid of any kind of sexual activity if it's going to hurt. The brain tells you it's not ready."
Others told us they had experienced emotional swings while on the pill — feeling flat, anxious or emotionally vulnerable.
In Good Shape: Sex and sexual health

Lee*, a South African woman in her early 40s, took the pill 10 years ago but stopped after only two months because she felt it had destabilized her moods.
"I was so up and down on the pill that I stopped and moved to [an intrauterine device]," she told DW. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are a non-hormonal form of contraception, inserted into the uterus by a doctor.
Only one woman DW spoke with reported a consistently positive experience. Based in Canada, and preferring to remain anonymous, she originally started the pill to treat acne. Years later, she's still using it, but now primarily for contraception. 
"For me, it's been really great and helped me function a bit better. During my period, my hormones are so regulated, and leading up to days 14 and 15, libido wise, I feel very active in those days," she said.

So, does the pill dampen libido?
The short answer: it's complicated. Libido is shaped by multiple factors: hormonal, psychological, relational and social — not just by the pill.  
Even in the study that found decreased libido in 15% of women, the majority (85%) reported either no change or an increase in desire. Researchers believe a boost in libido could be linked to the psychological relief of not having to worry about pregnancy. 
Dr. Tanaya Narendra, a sexual health educator from India, said that while lower libido is a known side effect of the pill, it has not been proven universally — a "universal connection is yet to be established," she said. 
For one thing, contemporary forms of the pill differ greatly from earlier versions.
"Initially, when the pill was made, the hormones in the pill were in milligrams. Now they're in micrograms, so there's been a reduction in hormones, and a dramatic change in the production of the pill," Narendra said.


Different hormone combinations are now tailored to different needs: acne, endometriosis, irregular periods and contraception. This makes it difficult to draw conclusions about their effects on sexual desire.
Narendra said the effect on libido should be taken seriously, but also that she felt there was a broader narrative at work, "pushed by conservative voices aiming to curtail women's reproductive autonomy."
Increasingly on the internet you can see people asking whether the pill affects their libido.
"The conservative media downplaying women's autonomy, [...] … has become suggestive in nature and led people to believe that it would have negative side effects," she said.
But Narendra believes the bigger failure lies not in the pill itself, but in the silence and stigma around women's health and use of contraception. 
Women, said Narendra, have not been taught to understand their bodies without judgment or shame. This lack of awareness has left space for confusion, misinformation and fear to grow, she said.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Germany has cut its budget for international development by 8%, and emergency aid has been halved. Aid agencies have warned of drastic consequences.

The governing coalition of the conservatives (CDU/CSU) and the Social Democrats (SPD) has slashed the budget of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) by 8% to just under €10 billion ($11.47 billion).
Development Minister Reem Alabali Radovan (SPD) is clear about the impact of the cut: "My budget is down by around €910 million compared to the previous year. In view of increasing crises, Germany is investing far less in international cooperation than is actually urgently needed."
Nevertheless, she told the German parliament that the measures wouldn't hamstring German development policy.
"We are a long way off American conditions — and that's how it should be," stressed the minister, who was appointed in May.
She was keen to ward off any comparisons with the massive aid cuts made by the second administration of Donald Trump.
Dramatic increase of hunger, malnutrition
Alabali Radovan gave one example of the impact of Trump's policies: "In Kenya, over 700,000 refugees, many from Somalia, have been directly affected by the US cuts to the World Food Program."
The 35-year-old minister said the refugees had only received a third of the necessary food rations, leading to a dramatic increase of hunger and malnutrition.
"Tensions are growing, many people have to flee, the region is becoming increasingly destabilized," she warned. "This is unacceptable in human terms and is also not in Germany's security interests."
What the end of USAID means — Global Us

However, aid organizations have said that Germany's cuts will also have drastic consequences.
Compared to 2024, less than half of the acute emergency aid provided by the Foreign Ministry is available: €1.05 billion instead of €2.23 billion. And that aid has dropped by two-thirds since 2022.
Thorsten Klose-Zuber, secretary general of the NGO Help, has sounded the alarm. He said the 50% cut in German emergency aid will mean that over 4 million people worldwide will no longer receive any food aid.
"The discontinuation of humanitarian aid from the United States and the halving of the German budget do not represent the start of our financial problems. For many years now, it has barely been possible to reach half of the people affected," Klose-Zuber added.
He put the total number of people in need at more than 320 million.
Consequences for health care, drinking water
The drastic reduction in aid money also has a concrete impact in other areas.
"Over one and a half million people will lose their basic health care due to the German cuts, " said Klose-Zuber. The situation is similar when it comes to access to clean drinking water, he added.
In his view, almost everything is lacking in the major crisis regions. And he's not only referring to countries affected by conflict, but also by recent natural disasters such as earthquakes, as in Myanmar or Afghanistan.
In both countries, there were thousands of deaths and massive destruction, especially to buildings.

His conclusion sounds almost desperate: "It increasingly makes me think of an emergency doctor who arrives at a traffic accident with five seriously injured casualties, and the doctor has to prioritize who dies and who he cares for."
His aid organization is in a similar position, according to Klose-Zuber. It can only concentrate on the countries with the greatest need.
The NGO head does not think other countries will step in to fill the gaps created by Germany's budget cuts. "We are seeing a fundamental movement worldwide, especially from the traditional Western donor countries, to pull out of the agreed multilateral system financially."


Greens consider cuts irresponsible
In the view of the environmentalist Greens, the massive cuts in development and emergency aid are irresponsible.
"No one has claimed that we alone can fill the gaps left by the US with its withdrawal," said Bundestag lawmaker Jamila Schäfer.
"But the fact that we are not even trying to somehow close this gap really hurts — especially the people directly affected."

The governing Christian Democrats and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, have a completely different view of the effectiveness of German and international development aid.
"I think global scaremongering is wrong," said CDU lawmaker Inge Grässle in the Bundestag debate. The conservatives want to show that good results can just as well be achieved in development cooperation with €10 billion.

AfD wanted to cut aid even more severely
If the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) had had its way, the Development Ministry's budget would have been gutted to €2.5 billion.
In reality, it's around four times as high despite the cuts. AfD lawmaker Mirco Hanker considers that to be a "waste of taxpayers' money," citing as an example an electromobility concept supported by Germany in India.
"One can at least ask the question whether India, as a large nation and emerging power that has successfully landed probes on the moon, cannot finance its concepts and infrastructure itself?" he asked.
Development Minister Alabali Radovan is largely unimpressed by the views of the AfD and other critical voices.
"Every euro that is invested wisely worldwide promotes security and peace, including for us in Europe and Germany," she said.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Oceans cover three-quarters of the Earth, yet only 20% of the seafloor has yet been mapped. The race to understand these depths could further scientific understanding, but also lead to exploitation.
    International researchers have so far mapped just one-fifth of the mysterious ocean floor Image: H. Goethel/blickwinkel/picture alliance   
Looking at Google Maps, it may seem as if every last corner of the planet has already been subjected to topographical surveys. But what lies beneath the ocean surface remains largely hidden from the view of orbiting satellites.
That's because radar signals can't penetrate water. So while commercial satellites provide a resolution of about 30 centimeters per pixel of the Earth's surface, ocean images are much rougher, with a resolution of around just 5 to 8 kilometers (3-5 miles) per pixel.
Only about 20% of the ocean floor has been surveyed so far with echo sounding. But Seabed 2030, a joint project between the United Nations and the private Nippon Foundation, aims to map the entire ocean floor by the end of this decade.

Ocean depths hold 'entire worlds'
"The ocean covers 71% of the planet, so it's just vast, incomprehensibly vast," said Laura Trethewey, a Canadian environmental journalist and author of "The Deepest Map: The High-Stakes Race to Chart the World's Oceans," published in 2023.
"There's just no terrestrial equivalent, which is why we so often compare the ocean to the moon or outer space. There's nowhere else on land that comes close to the ocean in terms of size," she added, pointing out that both the moon and Mars have been more thoroughly mapped than the ocean floor.
"We stretch for the stars and dream of building new perfect societies on Mars. But I would point out that we have this otherworldly space right here on Earth that we haven't finished exploring yet."

To explore the underwater universe, acoustic sound waves are emitted in a fan-like pattern from ships, diving robots and submarines in various directions toward the seafloor. The time it takes for these signals to travel to the bottom and back is measured individually for each sound wave, from which the depth is calculated. The deeper the sound, the deeper the sea.
Surveying with multibeam echo sounding provides topographic maps, three-dimensional models and terrain profiles even for very great depths. "There are entire worlds that we're missing out on right here on Earth — undiscovered mountains and canyons, animals unknown to science and just huge amounts of data and discoveries that are still out there waiting for us," said Trethewey.
In light of climate change, researching the seabed could also provide important information about what the future could hold.
"A lot of the seafloor used to be land. After the last ice age, melting glaciers released water that covered continental shelves that are equal to the size of South America. So there's a whole other continent down there, another lost Atlantis, that could hold insight into how past human societies navigated sea level rise and what we might do facing the same problem in the future," said Trethewey.
"Making the map is the first step in making that future a reality."


An ambitious project
Seabed 2030 will likely fall short of its ambitious goal, however. The oceans are simply too large and the ships and sonar equipment needed are lacking — not to mention the delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a waning political motivation.
"Back when the project launched in 2017, the world was a less fractured place, geopolitically. We live in a more unstable time now and governments are more suspicious and less willing to share maps," said Trethewey, adding that technology isn't the issue as it has existed for decades.
Organizers have tried in vain to "make up for any shortfalls with innovations like drones and crowdsourcing and recruiting super yachts and cruise ships to map the seafloor," she said.

Major 'push to exploit the deep sea'
But the fact remains that deep-sea exploration poses an extreme challenge for both humans and equipment. Adverse conditions at sea require expedition costs of around $50,000 (€43,000) a day, said Trethewey, "which means governments and businesses often need a good incentive to map, usually for resources, infrastructure or national security interests."
Seabed 2030 has estimated that the cost of reaching its goal will be between $3 billion and $4 billion (€2.5 billion to €3.4 billion) —roughly equivalent to the NASA Mars mission that began in 2020 and included landing a rover on the planet.
One downside of success could be that more complete mapping would significantly accelerate the exploitation of the oceans, however. "When people think of maps, they often think of mining and resource extraction. And they're not wrong. Right now there’s a big push to exploit the deep sea and open the first commercial mines in international waters," said Trethewey.


But she hopes that mapping will be used primarily for science and conservation, as the international community agreed to do after the complete mapping of Antarctica with the Antarctic Treaty in 1959, which protected the continent for scientific purposes for 60 years.
Still, strict regulations are unlikely to protect the deep sea as effectively as ignorance and inaccessibility.
"Nearly two-thirds of the ocean and almost half the surface of the planet fall in what's called international waters, so no country or person has ownership rights over it. This unclear legal status is the major reason why the international ocean is mostly unmonitored and unregulated, and why it's so hard to tackle crime at sea, whether it's overfishing or pollution or drug trafficking," said Trethewey.
"Stricter ocean governance would be welcome, but what’s perhaps more important are money and political will," she added. "The ocean is vast, incomprehensibly vast [...] and without money to fund monitoring and enforcement at sea, more rules are largely meaningless."

 Mayoral race in Frankfurt on the Oder headed for runoff
    
The race for mayor in Frankfurt on the Oder, in the eastern state of Brandenburg, is headed for a runoff between independent candidate Axel Strasser and Wilko Möller of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Official figures say Strasser, 48, took 32.4% of the vote in Sunday's first round.
Möller, 58, who is a member of the state parliament, won 30.2%.
The second round between Strasser and Möller is set for October 12.
A win for Möller would make him the right-wing extremists' first ever city mayor.
Desiree Schrade, of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the senior coalition partner in the federal government, followed in third place with 28.8% of the vote.
The center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), the CDU's junior coalition partner, trailed in fourth with 8.6%.

 Germany sends two Eurofighters to track Russian aircraft
    
Germany's air force on Sunday sent two Eurofighters to follow a Russian IL-20m military aircraft that had entered neutral airspace over the Baltic Sea, before handing the escort over to NATO partners in Sweden.
"Once again, our quick reaction alert force, consisting of two Eurofighters, was tasked by NATO with investigating an unidentified aircraft without a flight plan or radio contact in international airspace," Germany's air force said in a statement.
"It was a Russian IL-20M reconnaissance aircraft. After visual identification, we handed over escort duties for the aircraft to our Swedish NATO partners and returned to Rostock-Laage."
NATO's North Atlantic Council will meet on Tuesday to talk over Russia's violation of Estonian airspace, two officials familiar with the matter told the news agency Reuters on Sunday.
Russian drones or aircraft have allegedly violated the airspace of at least three NATO members recently, further raising tensions in Europe which have been heightened over Moscow's war in Ukraine.

 Dortmund: 400 football fans brawl in organized fight
    
Around 400 football hooligans appear to have been involved in what local police suspect may have been a pre-arranged fight near Dortmund on Saturday evening.
At about 10 p.m., a train carrying supporters of second-division side Schalke 04 back from their team's 2-0 win away at Magdeburg was twice brought to a halt just east of Dortmund after an emergency break was pulled.
The second time, a large group of Schalke "risk fans" reportedly exited the train and headed into a wooded area where police believe they encountered a group of "violently inclined" rival fans of Borussia Dortmund and FC Cologne.
Police later stopped around 300 Schalke fans, 90 Dortmund fans and five Cologne fans, many of whom had red marks on their hands and faces, according to a police spokesman.
Officers also reportedly found mixed martial arts (MMA) gloves, boxing handwraps, gum-guards and balaclavas in the area, and have charged some of those allegedly involved with breach of the peace, grievous bodily harm and interference with rail traffic.
The rivalry between neighbors Borussia Dortmund and Schalke 04 is one of the most intense in Germany but, with the latter currently in Bundesliga 2, the two haven't met for a men's first-team "Revierderby" since a 2-2 draw in March 2023.
Despite the rivalry, derby matches generally pass off peacefully, but small elements of both clubs' fanbases are inclined towards more violent confrontations.
It's not uncommon for hooligans to pre-arrange fights with similarly-minded rivals in secluded areas such as woodlands, a practice which is nevertheless illegal.
After drawing 4-4 away at Juventus in the Champions League in midweek, Borussia Dortmund host VfL Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga on Sunday evening.

The Revier derby is back!

 Kenya celebrates double triumph at Berlin Marathon

The first athletes have crossed the finish line in the Berlin Marathon, with both the men's and women's races being won by athletes from Kenya.
The men's race was won by 29-year-old Sabastian Sawe with a time of 2:02:15 — five months after his victory in the London marathon — while first place in the women's race went to compatriot Rosemary Wanjiru with a time of 2:21:05.
Despite Berlin's reputation as the fastest marathon route on the world circuit, both times were significantly off world-record time (Sawe 1:40 slower, Wanjiru 11:49 slower).
This can likely be attributed to the unusually humid late-summer conditions in the German capital.

 Could a German town elect a first ever AfD mayor?
    
One of Germany's most easterly towns is electing a new mayor on Sunday — with a far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) candidate among the favorites.
Mayoral elections are taking place in Frankfurt on the Oder on the Polish border after the previous incumbent René Wilke (independent since leaving the Left Party in June 2024) became interior minister for the state of Brandenburg.
Among the candidates to succeed Wilke in Germany's "other" Frankfurt (not to be confused with the more well-known banking metropolis Frankfurt on the Main) is Wilko Möller of the AfD, who could become the right-wing extremists' first ever city mayor.
According to a recent online survey by a local radio station Oderwelle last week, Möller came out on top with 1,396 votes, followed by a candidate from the center-left SPD (989), an independent (937) and a conservative (670). Around 450 respondents said they still hadn't made up their minds.
The survey was very much unofficial and unrepresentative but former policeman Möller, who grew up far away from Frankfurt in Hannover and North Rhine-Westphalia, is confident, telling tabloid Bild: "I'll get over 50% in the first round."
The biggest concerns in the town of 57,000 are a struggling economy, empty public coffers, a population drain, increasing crime and border checks resulting in long traffic jams.

 Some 55,000 runners roam streets of German capital
    
"On your marks! Get set! Go!" Or, as we say in German: "Auf die Plätze! Fertig! Los!"
The 51st Berlin marathon got underway on Sunday morning, with over 55,000 runners making their way through the streets of the capital.
Starting near the famous Brandenburg Gate, the runners will initially head west through the Tiergarten before embarking on a clockwise loop around the city center, passing through the districts of Moabit, Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshain, Kreuzberg, Neukölln, Schöneberg, Steglitz, Charlottenburg and Mitte, finishing on the Unter den Linden boulevard.
Last year's Berlin marathon saw a double-triumph for Ethiopia, with Milkesa Mengesha winning the men's race (2:03:17) and Tigist Ketema winning on the women's side (2:16:42).
But the vast majority of participants will be aiming for significantly slower times — or indeed just to finish at all.
They'll be cheered on along the route by hundreds of thousands of spectators, while helpers will be distributing 120,000 bananas, 80,000 apples and 1.25 million cups of water to keep the runners energized and hydrated.
According to the German weather service (DWD), this year's race is set to be one of the warmest ever, with Berlin enjoying late-summer temperatures of between 23-29°C (73-84°F).
Among the famous faces taking part are former footballers André Schürrle (a German World Cup winner in 2014) and Felix Kroos (bother of former Real Madrid star Toni).

 AfD tops poll with highest support ever
    
If federal elections were held in Germany today, the far-right populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) would emerge as the largest party, according to an opinion poll released on Sunday.
The poll, conducted by the Insa institute on behalf of tabloid newspaper Bild, put the anti-immigration party up one percentage point at 26%, overtaking the ruling conservative CDU/CSU bloc which remained unchanged at 25%.
The center-left Social Democrats (SPD), the junior partner in the current coalition government, would increase their share of the vote by one percentage point to 15%, according to the poll, while the Green Party and far-left Left Party would both be on 11%.
The left-wing populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) and the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) would both fall short of the minimum 5% threshold required to enter parliament at 4% and 3% respectively.
The AfD, which has been officially classified as a "confirmed right-wing extremist endeavor" by Germany's Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz or BfV), won 20.8% of the vote in February's federal elections.
Despite being the second-largest party in parliament, the other parties refused to enter into a coalition with the AfD.

The head of DB Regio, Germany's regional rail division, is set to take over as the head ofthe ailing Deutsche Bahn national railway, German news agency DPA reported, citing information obtained from government sources.
German Transportation Minister Patrick Schnieder has allegedly proposed DB regional chief Evelyn Palla for the job. Her appointment would need to be approved by the supervisory board, which is scheduled to meet on Tuesday.
If confirmed, Palla will be the first woman to head Deutsche Bahn. She will succeed Richard Lutz, who has led the state-owned company since early 2017. 
In August, Transportation Minister Schnieder announced the plan to appoint a new chief executive to carry out a fresh strategy to lead Deutsche Bahn out of the crisis. That strategy is expected to be revealed on Monday.
Germany's national railway is notoriously unreliable. In August, only about 60% of its long-distance trains ran on time.

On September 22, a moment of decision will take place on New York's East River at the United Nations General Assembly.
France, Canada, and Belgium intend to recognize Palestine as a state, and the United Kingdom is also likely to take the step.
The goal is to exert pressure on Israel to end the Gaza war and initiate a new peace process. 
Germany, however, is not among them. 
 "We won't be joining this initiative," said Chancellor Friedrich Merz in August when Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited.

 Climate protests across Germany as government pushes for new gas-powered plants
    
Climate demonstrations are taking place across Germany after the German government announced a new "pragmatic" approach to energy policy. 
Earlier this week, conservative German Economy and Energy Minister Katherina Reiche unveiled a series of proposals, such as the building of new gas-fired plants and the phasing out of certain renewable subsidies, in order to boost energy security and supply.

 Thousands take part in abortion-related demonstrations in Berlin and Cologne
    
According to police, 2,500 people are present at the anti-abortion "March for Life" demonstration in Berlin. Attendees carried signs with slogans such as "No Children — No Future" and "Inclusion Begins Before Birth."
The demonstration took place on the south side of Berlin's main station, in an area known on the Washingtonplatz.  
According to the Berlin Tagesspiegel newspaper, one of the speakers at the "March for Life" event said the practice of abortion is unacceptable even in the case of rape.   
A pro-choice counterprotest also took place in the German capital, with participants carrying slogans such as "My Body, My Choice" and "Sexual Self-Determination is a Human Right."

 Pro- and anti-abortion protests in Berlin and Cologne
    
Opponents of liberal abortion laws are to take part in protests entitled "March for Life" in the German cities of Berlin and Cologne, with Catholic bishops among those participating in the demonstratons.
Organizers have informed authorities that some 5,000 protesters will attend each of the two marches, which have been called by the anti-abortion organization Bundesverband Lebensrecht (BVL), a name that translates roughly to Federal Association for the Right to Life.
Counterprotests will also take place in both cities, with 2,000 people registered in Berlin and 1,000 in Cologne.
In the runup to the protests, the chairman of the Catholic German Bishops' Conference, Georg Bätzing, wrote an approbatory greeting to participants.
The BVL, which includes 15 anti-abortion groups, said two leading Catholic figures will be taking part in the Berlin march: Regensburg Bishop Rudolf Voderholzer and Matthias Heinrich, an auxiliary bishop who serves in Berlin.
In the past, the participation of Catholic figures in the protests has sparked some controversy in the church itself, as far-right activists and parties often also take part.
Abortion in Germany is illegal except in cases when the life of the pregnant person is in danger. However, it is a nonpunishable crime during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy if the person receives the mandatory counselling.
Regular efforts are made by leftist parties to liberalize the laws,but conservatives have so far remained adamant in their opposition.

 Climate protesters to call for exit from gas
    
Demonstrations and protest actions are planned in 70 German cities on Saturday amid a call for worldwide climate rallies by the student activist group "Fridays for Future."
The protests calling for an end to fossil fuel use and investment in a fair energy transition come as German climate activist Luisa Neubauer heavily criticized the energy policies of Economy Minister Katharina Reiche from the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), the party led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz.
Neubauer told the EPD news agency of Germany's Protestant Church that Reiche's policies were "a security risk to our livelihoods."
This comes after Reiche on Monday announced that the government would build new gas-fired power plants while reducing the expansion of renewable energy sources.
Climate activists say that such measures will make it difficult or impossible to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the extent necessary to curb global warming, which scientists say poses a grave threat to human existence.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[A new Chinese AI system is said to detect even the most modern submarines. Is it a real threat to maritime security or just a bluff?
    Nuclear-powered submarines equipped with ballistic missiles such as the USS Ohio are crucial for deterrence Image: Juan Antoine King/ABACA/picture alliance   
Psychological warfare has often involved touting technological superiority while suggesting that opponents are powerless against it. That might be the right context in which to view a new study about an advanced artificial intelligence-driven anti-submarine warfare (ASW) system out of China that can reportedly detect 95% of even the stealthiest submarines.
Last week, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post outlined the study, published in August by the trade journal Electronics Optics & Control. It announced that the China Helicopter Research and Development Institute had created an AI system that can simultaneously evaluate measurement data from various sources. From sonar buoys and underwater microphones to water temperature and salinity, the system reportedly creates a dynamic map of the underwater environment in real time.
The game-changing technology developed under chief engineer Meng Hao can also respond flexibly to countermeasures such as zigzag maneuvers and the deployment of decoys or drones. The study said that in computer simulations, the system was able to successfully locate the target in about 95% of cases, thus jeopardizing proven methods of submarine camouflage and defense.
Another important advance is that the AI translates this complex data into simple action points for military personnel, helping them to make the right decisions quickly, even in stressful situations.

In future versions, the team of developers hopes to have the AI system work closely with drone swarms, surface ships and autonomous underwater robots. The aim is to create a three-dimensional, self-learning detection network that adapts to increasingly sophisticated evasion strategies and "scans" the ocean in real time.

A strategic dilemma for world powers
Existing defense strategies would be seriously undermined if the team successfully reaches their goals. The three pillars of nuclear deterrence, known as the "nuclear triad," consist of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, strategic bombers and submarine-launched ballistic missiles.
These delivery systems are designed to deter a potential attacker from launching a nuclear first strike because they ensure reliable retaliation. Entire naval fleets, which have so far relied on the strategic hide-and-seek tactics of nuclear-powered submarines, would face uncertainty if their submarine capabilities were threatened.

Psychological warfare?
An important caveat, however, is that military tactics involve not only deterrence, but also psychological warfare. News about things such as the new study are intended to anchor China's strategic superiority in the public perception. Simultaneously, China has been demonstrating its presence in strategically important waters such as the Taiwan Strait and the South and East China Seas.
Gaining control of Taiwan would be particularly significant to the Chinese submarine fleet because they have so far had to launch mainly from shallow waters near the Yulin and Yalong bases on Hainan Island. There, they are easily located by enemy sensors and reconnaissance systems.


Taiwan in the crosshairs
If China could control access to the Pacific Ocean via Taiwan and the surrounding island groups, its submarines would gain direct access to deep water to be deployed more credibly as nuclear second-strike options.
This is why China has been heavily upgrading its naval forces in recent years, equipping strategically important sea areas with radar, sonar and buoy chains, in addition to intimidating its neighbors with large-scale naval maneuvers.


Playing cat and mouse
While China is making remarkable progress with AI, Western military experts doubt that the new submarine detection system poses an immediate threat to global defense strategies.
Professor Paul S. Schmitt, a US expert on strategic and operational naval warfare, told DW that AI has the potential to make submarine hunting more successful by evaluating large amounts of data from different sensors and supporting human decision-makers, but implementation remains difficult because the underwater environment is extremely complex.
The idea of a fully networked and integrated AI-controlled solution is an interesting goal for the future, but currently seems optimistic due to the constant arms race between submarine technology and the means to detect it, he said. Schmitt is affiliated with the Naval War College, but noted that his comments do not necessarily represent those of the US Department of War, the Navy or the Naval War College.
German security experts have also said maritime armament dynamics are constantly locked in a game of cat and mouse with an uncertain outcome. This is precisely why maritime attack and defense techniques must also be developed dynamically.

The global balance of underwater power
China currently has 105 submarines, the largest fleet worldwide, followed by North Korea (90), the United States (74) and Russia (62).
However, modern, nuclear-powered submarines equipped with ballistic missiles (SSBNs) are particularly crucial to strategic competition, and the US has the largest and most advanced fleet, with around 14 Ohio-class SSBNs and more than 50 modern attack submarines. Russia follows with around 16 strategic submarines and numerous other nuclear attack and cruise missile submarines.
Meanwhile, China is rapidly expanding its fleet with at least six Jin-class and one Xia-class SSBNs, as well as several other new types. The United Kingdom and France each ensure their strategic security with four SSBNs (Vanguard and Triomphant classes, respectively) and additional nuclear-powered attack submarines.
Germany relies on modern diesel-electric submarines and plays a leading role in conventional technology, but does not have nuclear capabilities. Other relevant NATO countries with submarines include Italy, Spain, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Canada and Turkey, which rely on proven conventional technology.
Outside NATO, India's Arihant class and Israel's Dolphin submarines have special underwater capabilities.

Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter gave the Oktoberfest in the Bavarian capital its traditional launch on Saturday, opening a barrel of beer and marking it with the time-honored phrase "O'zapft is!" (Bavarian for "It is tapped").
Reiter then handed the first mug to Bavarian Premier Markus Söder with a wish for a peaceful festival, with the day's sunny, late summer weather auguring well for its success.


Ahead of the tapping, Söder described Oktoberfest as chance to get some relief in a period of multiple crises and a place where "pure high spirits" prevail.
Germany's biggest tourist event
The event held on the Theresienwiese fairground in central Munich is known as the world's largest beer and folk festival.
Belying its name, Oktoberfest always begins in September, running this year from September 20 bis October 5.
As the country's major tourist event, the annual festival, now in its 190th edition, is expected to attract at least 6 million visitors, with a record of 7.2 million set in 2023.

The amount of beer drunk at the festival is commensurate with visitor numbers, with revelers downing 7.4 million liters (1.95 million gallons) of the amber-hued, yeast-based beverage in the same year.
However, some might be in for a shock at what they now have to pay for a mug, with prices reaching record levels this year.
In addition to consuming beer in any of the numerous tents erected for that purpose, visitors can go on amusement rides, participate in games and enjoy traditional Bavarian dishes or other comestibles from the food stalls.
Many people gathered at the venue from the dark early hours of Saturday morning waiting for admission at 9 a.m. local time (7 a.m. GMT) so they were sure of getting a table in one of the tents, and then had to remain sitting patiently until the first beers were served at noon, after the opening.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Coffin or urn? If you die in Germany, you'll probably end up in a box in a public cemetery. Like it or not. The nation has some of the strictest funeral laws in western Europe. Now there's a shake-up in two states. 
    New German laws in two states now permit the creation of memorial diamonds from a person's ashes  Image: Soeren Stache/ZB/picture alliance   
The German states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt have overhauled their burial legislation, with lawmakers in the western German state taking the biggest stride. 
"After more than 42 years we have created a new framework that reconciles the individual ideas and wishes of the people in the state with a dignified act of bidding farewell," said Rhineland-Palatinate Health Minister Clemens Hoch, of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD).
From October 1, people in the western state will now be able to choose the Rhine, the Moselle, Lahn or Saar rivers as their final resting place. Until now, it has not been possible to scatter cremated remains in Germany rivers.

The new legislation, introduced by the coalition government of the SPD, environmentalist Greens and the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP), also caters for homebodies, giving loved ones the chance to keep an urn containing remains at home — another first — or opt to scatter the remains in the garden.
Creating memorial diamonds from human ashes 
The new laws in Rhineland-Palatinate and the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt also allow for the creation of "memorial diamonds" from the ashes of the deceased.
The synthetic diamonds are grown at high temperatures from the extracted carbon — a process introduced in Switzerland two decades ago. Such keepsakes are growing increasingly popular. 
The conservative opposition in Rhineland-Palatinate, the Christian Democrats (CDU), is worried the legislation might ring the death knell for cemeteries — with CDU politician Christoph Gensch accusing Hoch of being their "grave digger" in a state parliament debate.

There has also been criticism from the main Christian churches. Peter Kohlgraf, Catholic Bishop of Mainz, told public broadcaster ZDF that nobody would really know what happened to remains in private homes.
"I hate to think of urns getting forgotten in a move or jewelry made from ashes getting lost," Dorothee Wüst, the president of the Protestant Church in the Palatinate, told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
German burial laws out of step with social changes
The Federal Association of German Undertakers, the BDB, has, however, been lobbying for change. It represents 90% of the nation's funeral directors, some 5,000 companies. 
Secretary General Stephan Neuser said the new laws enshrined the will of the people. Neuser told DW that members were often approached by bereaved relatives wanting to take urns home or remove ash for the creation of jewelry mementos. 
"The burial culture that we have in Germany has greatly changed in recent years," he said.  
Some three-quarters of Germany's dead are now cremated. Only one in five are buried. 
With urns taking up much less space, plot leases sometimes as short as 10 years and rising upkeep costs, graveyards have long been disappearing nationwide. 
In Berlin's cemeteries, for example, an area of land equivalent to 476 soccer fields now lies vacant, according to a 2024 report by the city's Technical University.

Trend towards more personalized mourning and memorials 
Sociologist Thorsten Benkel said the trend reflects increasing mobility and changing attitudes toward mourning. 
"People no longer want to be dictated to about where or how they should mourn. Many people never visit graves for various reasons because they live far away, because they find it depressing. They often tell us: 'The place of mourning is wherever I am and not where the dead body is,'" he told DW.
Digital space has increasingly become a space for grief and the preservation of memories. The researcher from the University of Passau nevertheless does not think that graveyards will vanish — but become one option among many.

Benkel believes people in Germany should have a freer hand in deciding what graves should look like, as in the Netherlands.   
The new laws in Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt mirror increased sensibility for the pain of losing babies in the early stages of pregnancy, with burial now obligatory for "Sternenkinder" ("children from the stars") — the terms miscarriage and still birth are consciously avoided.
Saxony-Anhalt now also permits shroud burial for the first time for Muslims and Jews, while Rhineland-Palatinate has extended the option to everyone irrespective of faith. 


Green funerals increasingly popular
Religious and cultural diversity, secularization and concern for mental well-being and the environment are growing, even if funeral legislation has often not kept pace. 
Woodland burial grounds have become increasingly popular in Germany. The first was set up in 2001, and now the main two operators alone run 175 sites. 
Many people prefer the informal natural setting to the regimented rows of conventional graveyards. It's also cheaper, and leases can run up to 99 years.   
This turn toward nature is reflected, too, in the interest in river and sea burials despite their potential environmental impact.
River burials in Rhineland-Palatinate will be strictly regulated and are in line with existing rules about sea burials. Ashes must be consigned to the waters in a biodegradable urn from a ship.

In a far more radical back-to-nature act, the northern state of Schleswig-Holsteinis testing natural organic reduction or terramation. Bodies are placed in straw-lined "cocoons," where microorganisms convert the remains to soil in about 40 days.
The pilot project, now extended to June 2026, is being monitored by the University of Leipzig. No environmental risks have been so far detected.
Preventing 'death tourism'
Aeternitas, a funeral care consumer initiative, would like the changes in Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt to catch on, but fears considerable resistance.
"One problem in Germany is that the burial rules are predominantly characterized by mistrust and outdated traditions, whereas a much more liberal approach is usual in other countries. Many people simply don't follow the existing rules," press officer Alexander Helbach told DW. 
Some Germans have simply been cremating their loved ones outside the country and taking away their remains — or sending urns to crematoriums abroad to get access to the ashes.
To stop that kind of "death tourism," only people living in Rhineland-Palatinate will be eligible for river burials. Even nostalgic ex-residents stand no chance.
And if someone you have designated to take care of your urn moves to another German state, they are neither permitted to keep it in their home nor pass it on to someone else. These differences in regional laws could lead to absurd — and potentially heartbreaking — scenarios.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[A YouTuber who fled Russia after speaking out against the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine has not only started a football club — he has now won promotion to Cyprus' topflight.
    Yevgeny Savin was a once professional footballer and was called up to the Russia's U21 team several times in the 2000s Image: DW   
"I'm in tears with joy. We've built a team that can compete with APOEL. This is just the beginning," says Yevgeny Savin.
On an August evening, the president of the Krasava ENY Ypsonas football club sits in one of the upper tiers of the Ammochostos Stadium in Larnaca, looking out at the empty pitch.
The football club, which he had originally founded in Russia four years ago and re-registered in Cyprus after the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has just made its debut in the country's topflight. Although Krasava lost the match 2-1, the fact that it came against Cyprus' most successful club, APOEL Nicosia, means that in Savin's eyes, this was a success.
Former football turned YouTube star
Savin was a once professional footballer and was called up to the Russia's U21 team several times in the 2000s. After his playing career ended, he became a media star, first as the host of a show on the sports channel Match TV, part of the state-owned media holding company Gazprom-Media. In 2018, he founded the YouTube channel "Krasava," where he discussed Russia's problems from a football perspective.
The Russian word "Krasava" is youth slang, a word that expresses respect. It also incorporates the abbreviation of Savin's surname, "Sava."

Savin currently has a million followers on Instagram and YouTube. Millions of views of his videos have brought him sponsorship deals and a considerable income. He earns up to €1.2 million ($1.4 million) a year, Savin tells DW. He founded the club in 2021, and Krasava initially competed in the third division of Russian football.
But immediately after the invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, Savin left Russia with his wife and two children. He condemned the war and released a video featuring Ukrainian athletes expressing their feelings about the invasion.
This led to Krasava being banned from training at a stadium in the Moscow region. Savin was eventually charged with "discrediting" the Russian army and sentenced to prison in absentia in Russia in March 2024.
Starting over
But fleeing Russia didn't mean Savin was about to give up on the idea of owning his own football club. He had chosen Cyprus to go into exile because it is relatively cheap to run a professional football club there. In Ypsonas, a suburb of Limassol, Savin bought a local club's license for several hundred thousand euros — to play in the country's second division.
This is not the same legal entity as the Russian club Krasava, but a new one. However, the colors, the emblem, and above all, its president and the principles he had founded it on — as an "honest private club" — remain the same.

Savin has since sunk about €1.5 million of his own money into the club and has been helped by sponsorship from an online broker owned by a Russian-born billionaire who also turned his back on his homeland. This allowed the club to win promotion to the first division after just three seasons.
But life away from home is not without its downside, like being separated from his ailing father, who still lives in Russia and cannot travel.
"I feel guilty that we can't see each other," Savin says. He once wrote to him: "Dad, forgive me. I couldn't help it," he says, referring to his public criticism of the war and decision to leave Russia.


Makeshift office
Savin welcomes the DW reporter to his club's training facility at a sports complex in Limassol. It consists of two small artificial turf pitches and a roughly 20-square-meter room behind a glass door, which has been converted into an office.
In one corner, there is a small table displaying the trophy and a gold medal from last season's second division championship, as well as an icon of St. Sava, that was given to him by a priest.

His club, Savin admits, is still a "startup." All of his employees multitask and work late into the night — just like he does.
"You have to set an example; that's the only way to show that Krasava is more than just a football club and a job. We are a family," Savin stresses.
Russians and Ukrainians supporting the same club
Krasava targets immigrants from post-Soviet countries as its fan base.
"Ninety percent of our fans speak Russian. Krasava unites people from Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, and other countries in the stands," Savin says.
"It's hard to imagine another place where people gather, shout together in Russian, and cheer on a football club."

But his contributions to the Russian-speaking community go even further. Free weekly training sessions are offered on the club's grounds for children from Russian- and Ukrainian-speaking families that receive support at the YASAM special therapy center in Limassol.
Many of the Krasava fans are young, Russian-speaking immigrants who work in the IT or finance sector in Cyprus and have only been living on the island for a few years. One of them, Aleksandr from Moscow, says he often goes to Krasava games with people from various post-Soviet countries. "They are my friends, friends of friends — people who love football and speak Russian. We went there once and were immediately hooked. We liked the community."
Aiming even higher
Yevgeny Savin, of course, also attends the games. He stands among the fans in the stands, takes selfies, discusses the game, and leads enthusiastic chants — and he continues to dream big.
"The next step is to qualify for European club competitions," he says. "So that the whole world learns about the Krasava football club and its history, which, I'm sure, is inspiring."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Thrifting is hailed as a cheap and green alternative to fast fashion. But when DW reporter Katharina Schantz set out to find the perfect pre-loved shirt, it made her question what she thought she knew about secondhand.

Secondhand is winning two-to-one on my clothing rack. It makes sense. I grew up thrifting. I'll never forget the thrill of digging up the navy-blue plush hoodie of my dreams at one of the countless flea markets I visited with my mom as a kid. But today, I'm on a smaller mission for a basic black t-shirt because I'm over the ones I have.
Since I found that hoodie, secondhand has had a serious glow up. Small, chaotic charity shops like Goodwill or Oxfam have given way to minimalistic vintage boutiques where a used shirt can cost more than a new one. And it's big business.
In 2024, the global secondhand apparel market was worth $227 billion (€194 billion) — as much as Apple's yearly sales, according to retail analyst Neil Saunders. Younger Gen Z and millennial consumers are driving the thrifting craze — for a few reasons. 
"It's now a creative sector where people go for fun," said Saunders. "On top of that, a lot of people see it as a way of being sustainable."

And it's no wonder. Fashion is a dirty industry, responsible for up to 10% of human-made greenhouse gas emissions— not to mention massive water use and freshwater pollution.
Then there's overproduction. The rapid turnover of cheap fashion means a truckload of clothing is sent to landfill or incinerated every second. 
And some garments never even see the inside of a shop, with studies suggesting 10 to 30% of clothing is never actually sold.  Most of that is treated as trash. 
That's where resale — or secondhand — comes in. Resale promises to reduce waste and even cut fashion industry CO2. One  study  found that secondhand sales could slash premium apparel and outdoor brand carbon emissions 16% by 2040.
So, if resale really is part of the solution, then getting my black tee this way feels like the right thing to do.

Thrifting's promise to cut fashion's pollution problem
My hunt began at Vintage Revivals, a busy store in Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg district. Clara Metzger, the store manager — dressed in vintage from head to toe — carefully curates her wares.
They come from Texaid, a German company for commercial clothing recycling, but Metzger said she can't resell everything. Some items go to another store that's less picky about quality.
"I weed out that kind of thing because it's pure polyester," she said, pointing to a bright turquoise headscarf. "I pick this stuff up, and feel ... yeah, it's pure trash."

What's better – cotton or polyester clothing?

Metzger has noticed a decline in the quality of secondhand clothes since fast-fashion brands like Primark and Shein started flooding the market.
But the garments she sells are a bit beyond my budget. Analyst Saunders told me the real business happens online, where 88% of US resale money was spent in 2024. So, I pick up my phone — and discover a realm of endless choices.
How big fashion jumped on the resale trend
Ten years ago, the online used apparel space was mainly peer-to-peer sales platforms like eBay and Poshmark, said Saunders.
"Then, a lot of retailers started taking notice. They wanted a piece of this growth," he explained. Retailers from fast fashion brands like Zara  and Shein to outdoor companies like The North Face and shoe business Dr. Martens now all have online resale space.
Browsing here feels just like any other online shopping experience. The sites list items in different sizes and colors depending on availability. They give me a little boost too. I can "put things to better use" and contribute to "a better world to explore." Weirdly, it kind of makes me feel like a hero — for shopping?

How big fashion risks undermining thrifting's environmental promise 
But I notice some resale platforms are closely tied to the brand's core business model of new apparel. US sportswear retailer Lululemon, for example, offers in-store credit for used items. A shirt gets you $5 and a jacket $25, but the credit can only be spent on new products.
For seasoned online shoppers, some of the sales techniques feel very familiar — full of countdown timers and "last chance" alerts, designed to create urgency. Sellpy, a Swedish secondhand platform majority-owned by H&M, uses influencer marketing on social media. 
These mechanisms often aim to increase basket size, said Martin Reimann, a marketing professor at the University of Arizona in the US. 
"These same tools — borrowed from fast fashion and e-commerce playbooks — can reintroduce overconsumption habits into a space that was initially framed as more sustainable," he told DW. "In some cases, the line between mindful reuse and algorithmic overconsumption becomes very blurry."


How could brands stop fueling overconsumption? 
In a survey of UK consumers, British NGO WRAP found that only three out of five secondhand purchases on peer-to-peer platforms like eBay or Vinted replaced new items. The other two were additional purchases that contributed to overall consumption.
To make sure resale doesn't become just another stream of revenue, experts are calling on brands to set "displacement targets." For example, a brand could pledge to replace 10% of new clothes with used apparel, which would mean a 10% cut in fresh production.
But first, companies need to be transparent about how much they're producing. Brands are often opaque around their production volume, according to The Or Foundation, a Ghanaian nonprofit seeking sustainable alternatives to the current fashion system.
Wearing a new item can be more sustainable than thrifting
So, does secondhand always deliver on its sustainability promise? Researchers from Utrecht University in the Netherlands suggested the best way to reduce emissions is to wear items longer.


The study compareddifferent types of shoppers and their emissions. They found that a fashionable secondhand consumer — someone who buys a used shirt but only wears it 10 times before moving onto the next trend — creates more emissions than a firsthand shopper who is really attached to their shirt and wears it 80 times. 
The environmental cost of making and discarding a shirt stays with it throughout its lifecycle, no matter how many owners it has, said the researchers. For heavier items like dresses, which are typically worn less, the impact is even greater. 
So, secondhand is a great way to give something a new lease of life if the item is worn a lot and consumers and retailers don't end up repeating the same patterns that have made fashion so polluting in the first place. 
But in the end, my journey left me wondering whether I even needed a new shirt. The other ones in my closet might also do.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[International Equal Pay Day, on September 18, highlights gender inequalities across employment sectors. But sport has a series of circumstances that make it a particularly tough nut to crack.

At a glance, women's sport seems to be accelerating towards equal pay at a quicker rate than ever before. A 2021 report by the BBC found that 90% of sports now offer equal prize money at their major championships,  and packed out stadiums for women's matches in major sports like football, tennis and cricket have become commonplace. But it's not as simple as that.
"Sport does rank rather badly against all sorts of other sectors when it comes to equal pay and conditions," Lombe Mwambwa, the interim CEO of the Global Observatory for Gender Equality and Sport, told DW.
Though little sport-specific data exists, the consensus is that elite female footballers earn 15-25% of their male equivalents. While there are exceptions like tennis, which is moving towards equal prize money for men and women at all tournaments, the gaps are significant across the top end of most sports.
There are almost as many reasons for that as there are sports: the historical banning of women's sports in many countries, a lack of willingness to invest in them, a lack of professional pathways and maternity provisions and, perhaps most enduringly, the perception that sport is for men and there is only a commercial appetite for men's sports.

Alex Culvin, a former footballer who now works for global players union FIFPRO, said comparing the salaries of the top earners in the sport does the equal pay argument a disservice — it only looks at a tiny, distorted fragment of the picture.
Salary floors and grassroots changes
"I think the men's top 5% earners really inflate the market. If you're a lower league player, you're not earning that €400,000 ($470,000) a week, you're probably earning €4,000 a week. And some women's players are on that."
Culvin advocates for so-called salary floors in the women's game and a more organic approach to growth. These collective agreements, which are in place in the top leagues in the USA, UK and Spain, operate similarly to a minimum wage while female footballers successfully battled to win limited maternity rights in 2024.
"I think the smart business thing to do is invest in your women's team, provide environments in which they can thrive. Revenues will come into the game, and salaries will increase as a consequence," Culvin added.
For Mwambwa, simply equalizing pay instantly across all athletes is not realistic. Instead, she wants to see changes at the grassroots, and not just on the pitch.

Equal pay in football- just a crazy dream?

"We know women comprise a large part of the sports workforce that is voluntary, underpaid or not recognized as work. In many cases, for a long time, women have even worked as coaches and referees and all these other roles but have had lack of opportunities to progress due to various barriers like costs or lack of courses.
"If we are to think about in sport, we need to think broader than just the paycheck."
Conditions matter too
At the top level, conditions are often significantly worse for women, even where prize or appearance money is equal.
"There are federations who do window dressing to say they're an equal employer,” Culvin said, referring to national teams who have equalized match fees in recent years.
"But everything else is unequal — how they travel to games, the facilities or level of chef that they have and that kind of thing. All of the factors that enable players to perform are so disparate and unequal that really the match fee almost becomes irrelevant."
Jasmina Covic, one of a small number of female football agents told DW that while clubs at the top of football are investing in their women's team, it is not a universal policy.
"There are clubs who have big difficulties with it, and who say ‘No, the men's team always have priority. If they don't need to use the pitch, then the women's team can use it."
But a more existential threat to women's sport comes from the lurch of many countries, particularly the USA, to the political right. The introduction of legislation known as Title IX in 1972, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in any government-funded education setting, led to a surge in female participation. That is widely accepted to have contributed to the US' pre-eminence in both the women's football World Cup and the Olympics, the two largest sporting events in the world. 


Political picture gloomy
Days after returning to office, US President Donald Trump made changes to the law, which has numerous strands, banning transgender athletes from competing in women's events. Some see this as the first signs of a creep towards diminishing women's sports under the banner of his dismantling of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies.

"The Trump administration's broader assault on what it refers to as DEI – efforts to redress inequities based on historical and current forms of racism and other forms of discrimination – is having a deeply chilling impact. Even the word gender seems to be an anathema to the US government, with, for example, the US mission to the UN (United Nations) seeking to remove this word from every UN resolution," wrote Heather Barr, the Associate Director, Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch, earlier this year.
"What happens in schools is bound to affect sport, because lots of people start out sports engagement in the school system or connected to the school system," added Mwambwa. "So if we are seeing changes influenced from right wing or right wing leaning politics that do not value the idea of equality, then that's going to really have a big impact on sport."
Big events in big stadiums and the grand gestures from grand organizations undoubtedly have an impact — both on those playing and the next generation. But on International Equal Pay Day, it seems clear that sport must make greater efforts to address structural and historic inequalities in both pay and conditions as well as navigate global and local politics if it wants to move closer to parity.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Author Ayelet Gundar-Goshen writes to challenge fear and prejudice, taking a humanist perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Her new novel is a plea for empathy and self-reflection.

At first it felt barbaric to be writing a book after October 7, 2023, the Israeli author Ayelet Gundar-Goshen said, "especially while we have the hostages kept there, away from their families in Israel, and destruction going on in Gaza — and you will allow yourself the privilege of escaping into a different world, into a world made of your own words? It felt wrong."
Then came the turning point that dispelled her hesitations: when Israeli government officials called for a boycott of books and films that portray Palestinians in a human way. "For me, this was a moment where I thought, 'Wait a minute. The right wing, the fascists, are scared of words. They truly believe that words can change something.' I thought, 'Well, if fascists fear words so much, then maybe it can also be used as a weapon,'" she said. "Not to escape reality with words, not as escapism — quite the contrary: as a way to face reality."
Psychological profile of Israel
Gundar-Goshen then resumed work on a novel that she had begun long ago. "Ungebetene Gäste" (Uninvited Guests) was published in German this summer.

In the novel, an Israeli toddler drops a hammer from a balcony, killing a teenage boy. A Palestinian construction worker who had been working on that balcony is arrested. The little boy's mother remains silent. What follows is a drama about guilt, denial and revenge — a mirror of Israeli society, which Gundar-Goshen sees as trapped in a fatal cycle of fear of the "Other."
Gundar-Goshen isn't just a novelist; she's also a psychotherapist. In her writing, she traces hidden mechanisms — ones she has also discovered in herself. A few years ago, while she was a young mother, she had a Palestinian laborer working in her home. Suddenly a news report came on: A Palestinian worker had murdered his Israeli employer. "The room became charged with fear," she said. "Like, you can smell the fear. And, after a minute, I realized he's scared of me just as much as I’m scared of him, because he knows that I can call the Israeli police and say, 'Listen, I have a worker here and I don’t feel safe.' They'll come in two minutes and take him."


'The terrible trauma'
"Ungebetene Gäste" illuminates psychological dynamics that shape everyday Israeli-Palestinian life. "The fact that you think of yourself as a potential victim," Gundar-Goshen said, "makes you ready to be an aggressor."
Gundar-Goshen carries her therapist's perspective over into her work as a writer: not judging, but rather trying to understand why people act as they do. "I'm thinking about how difficult it is for people to acknowledge at the same time the terrible trauma of October 7 — which cannot be justified, never can be justified — but at the same time to acknowledge the terrible trauma committed right now towards the Palestinians, while the trauma to the hostages' families continues," she said. "It is as if one side has to be deleted in order for people to be able to stand."

Gundar-Goshen is fairly alone in extending empathy to both sides. Voices like hers are drowned out in the global noise of an ideologically overheated debate — fought at times with violence, but more often with protests, political litmus tests and the canceling of artists, intellectuals and musicians.
In Israel, the kind of critical self-reflection Gundar-Goshen practices has virtually no chance of making a breakthrough — yet that's what makes it all the more important. She says she's trying to explore her own blind spots, "And quite often I find that my blind spots are universal blind spots that we have," she says. "If we do not go through this painful moment of truly looking at ourselves in the mirror, we will never be able to change anything."

Writing isn't enough
Gundar-Goshen regularly takes part in demonstrations against the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , for the return of the hostages and for an end to the war. Shje said writing could be an act of resistance, but one that is insufficient on its own. "I'll say: No, this is not enough," she said. "And you have to combine your legs in the street, your shouting in the street and your writing hand — and your entire body has to work in this."

She has not given up hope for reconciliation. "I'm not pessimistic — because I'm thinking," she said. "I'm looking at history. I'm looking at the fact that I'm in Berlin right now: OK, we're having this interview in Berlin, and, if I told my grandparents a few years ago that I would be sitting here talking with you, then they wouldn't believe it, right? Things can change in history. They can so easily change for the worse. But things can also change for the better."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[US tariff policy is having unexpected consequences for consumers — in some places. Coffee is becoming cheaper in Brazil, and in Mexico tomatoes are less expensive. US shoppers, meanwhile, are facing rising grocery bills.

Customers at a supermarket on Avenida Rua Bolivar in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, are positively surprised at the price changes they've been experiencing over the past few weeks, as they are now paying significantly less for coffee and meat, for example.
"Finally, some good news in these difficult times," says shopper Julienne Freitas, while speaking with DW.
Her experience is not anecdotal but rather echoed by a recent survey from Brazil's Inter-Union Department of Statistics and Socio-Economic Studies (DIEESE) — a research institute affiliated with trade unions that produces scientific studies.

Compiled with the collaboration of government agency CONAB, the survey found that food prices fell in 24 of Brazil's 27 regional state capitals in the month of August, compared with July, with basics such as tomatoes, rice, meat and coffee all becoming cheaper.
Tariffs and agricultural cycles
Part of the decline comes from natural cycles typical for agriculture, says Leandro Dias from the agricultural commodities trading platform AgroDeri in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
"Coffee had a strong harvest, which increased supply and pushed down prices. With beef, the livestock cycle is in a phase with plenty of cattle ready for fattening, which the domestic market is now feeling," he told DW.
But US tariffs on Brazilian imports are also playing a role, he added, referring to US President Donald Trump's 50% tariff rate on most goods earlier this year. Such excessive tariffs would generally cause "inflation at home and slow competitiveness abroad," said Dias.

As a result, US consumers would face rising prices on foods targeted by Washington's trade measures, while prices for those same goods were falling in producing countries.
Economist Douglas Eustaquio of Grupo Boticario — one of the largest cosmetics companies in Brazil — argues that tariffs are reshaping supply and demand in Brazil.
Products that were partly or entirely intended for the US market, he told DW, are now staying in Brazil and "supplying the domestic market," he said, noting that beef prices are adjusting more slowly but are also trending downward currently.


Political fallout over Bolsonaro trial
Donald Trump's tariffs imposed on Brazil are linked to the trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who was sentenced by Brazil's Supreme Court to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup. Washington imposed punitive tariffs in response to the trial, citing concerns over the suppression of opposition and free expression.
Brazil's government, however, insists its judiciary is independent. The country's leftist president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has criticized the tariffs as unfair, pointing out that the US already runs a trade surplus with Brazil.
Between January and July 2025, Brazilian exports to the US totaled $23.7 billion (€20 billion), the highest ever for that period. At the same time, imports climbed 12.6% to $26 billion, pushing the US trade surplus with Brazil to $2.3 billion.

Economic risks from falling prices
A similar slump in food prices is currently unfolding in Mexico, where tomatoes, for example, have become significantly cheaper recently.
"In the region, there is high production, and producers in the north of the country are selling to central [Mexican] states instead of exporting to the United States, so the price is falling," Javier Reyes Escamilla, president of the Livestock Association of the Mid-North Region of the State of Mexico, told multiplatform news group Milenio.

But while consumers in producing countries are benefiting in the short term, the outlook may not be so bright in the longer run, says Brazilian economist Dirlene Silva.
"If producers lose access to an important market like the American one, they no longer have an incentive to invest. That means less technology, lower productivity, and even losses in quality," she told DW
Eventually, production could shrink, she warned, sending prices back up — this time to the detriment of local consumers in Brazil and beyond.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[A look at the evolution of the Italian protest anthem, from its opaque origins to TikTok remixes and feminist marches.

It wasn't penned as a romantic farewell, but "Bella Ciao" — meaning "goodbye beautiful" in Italian — is a song that has come to symbolize a parting with oppression.
When the phrase was discovered etched on an unspent bullet casing linked to the man accused of killing conservative US activist Charlie Kirk, it wasn't just some cryptic clue.
It was a refrain bearing history, drawn from a century-old Italian protest song, which has long been a global tune of resistance.
While its connection to Kirk's death remains moot, this find has cast fresh light on a melody that has evolved from partisan movements to pop culture playlists.

Divergent origin stories
Widely labelled an anti-fascist anthem, "Bella Ciao" is sung annually on April 25 during Italy's Liberation Day to mark the end of Benito Mussolini's fascist dictatorship and the Nazi occupation in Italy. Its most widespread version tells the story of a partisan with unspecified political leanings, who dies for freedom, asking to be buried "under the shade of a beautiful flower."
But the song's origins are anything but clear. Some historians have traced its melody (without lyrics) to a 1919 recording by Odesa-born klezmer accordionist, Mishka Ziganoff.

Others point to a separate folk song sung by "mondine" — female rice paddy weeders in Northern Italy — protesting against harsh labor conditions. That version, also titled "Bella Ciao," shares little with the partisan anthem beyond its title.
The partisan version known today was solidified in the early 1960s, notably through a rendition by Italian-born French actor Yves Montand. As Utrecht University researchers Daniele Salerno and Marit van de Warenburg noted in their 2023 study of the song, its power lies not in its fixed origin but in its adaptability.
They described "Bella Ciao" as a "portable monument" — a cultural artifact that carries memory across time and space.
"Bella Ciao is continuously rewritten, reused, and relocated in different and new contexts and media, and for a range of causes," they wrote.

From resistance to remixes
Though not widely sung during World War II itself, "Bella Ciao" defined how Italians stood up to fascism after the war. Over the decades, it has been adopted by leftist movements across Europe and beyond.
In January this year, left-wing activists in Germany sang the song at a protest against the far-right party AfD.
In 2024, left-leaning members of the European Parliament sang it to protest Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's policies — prompting Parliament President Roberta Metsola to then quip, "This is not Eurovision."
In 2021, demonstrators in Jerusalem, opposed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hold on power despite an indictment and corruption allegations, sang "Bibi Ciao" at the prospect of his departure back then — "Bibi" being Netanyahu's nickname.
Carlo Pestelli, who authored the book "Bella Ciao: The Song of Freedom," told AFP in 2022 that the song's appeal lies in its adaptability and melodic simplicity.
"It wasn't a communist song but a manifesto for freedom… it represents apolitical values that everyone can understand and share," Pestelli said. "It is also an easy song to sing, with a catchy chorus that even non-Italian speakers can pick up."


Feminist protests and balcony choruses
Feminist activists have also repurposed the catchy ditty to fight their causes. Pro-choice activists in both Argentina and Poland repurposed the song in 2018 and 2020 respectively, calling out their governments for legislating unfavorably against women's reproductive rights.
On September 16, 2022 — the day 22-year-old Jina Mahsa Amini died following her arrest by Iran's morality police for wearing an improper hijab — sisters Samin and Behin Bolouri sang a Persian version of "Bella Ciao" in a social media post that went viral.

These localized adaptations reflect what Salerno and van de Warenburg call "transnational activism," where the song — also used by both the Occupy Wall Street and Fridays for Future movements — becomes a vessel for new struggles without losing its historical weight.
Its reach however, has extended far beyond politics. It was belted from balconies in Italy during COVID-19 lockdowns and has even been reworked by soccer fans in support of their clubs.
Digital reworking
"Bella Ciao" owes much of its recent popularity to Netflix's Spanish crime drama "La Casa de Papel" (or "Money Heist" in English), which introduced the song to a global audience.
The series' version, remixed by electronic dance music producers El Profesor and Hugel, has to date garnered more than 200 million views on YouTube. Dozens of versions, including indie interpretations, can also be heard on Spotify. 

It has also surfaced in gaming culture, featured in "Far Cry 6" and used on TikTok to score highlights from "Call of Duty: Warzone."
A legacy transcending ideologies
"Bella Ciao" has been used by movements across continents and ideologies — from anti-fascist and feminist activists to climate protesters and pop culture creators.
Its adaptability has made it a fixture in moments of dissent, solidarity and remembrance.
Whether sung in protest, remixed online or referenced cryptically on a bullet casing, "Bella Ciao" continues to serve as a signal — not of any particular ideology, but perhaps of resistance itself.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The widely expected cut of a quarter percentage point comes amid economic pressures ranging inflation and tariffs to sluggish job growth. Two more cuts are expected before the end of the year.

The US Federal Reserve , commonly known as the Fed, lowered its benchmark rate Wednesday by a quarter percentage point, the first such cut since last year.
It cut the benchmark lending rate to a range between 4.0% and 4.25%.
The Fed paused its easing cycle in January due to uncertainty over how President Donald Trump's import tariffs might affect inflation and the overall economy.
It said Wednesday's cut was warranted as, "downside risks to employment have risen" even as inflation has "moved up and remains somewhat elevated."
Although inflation remains slightly above the Fed's target rate of 2%, data shows hiring has slowed to a halt in recent months, while the unemployment rate has risen. 
Lowering interest rates, and reducing borrowing costs, is tool used by central banks to boost hiring and increase consumer spending. 

Tension between the White House and the Fed
The new Fed Governor, Stephen Miran, formerly an economic adviser to Trump, voted against the decision, favoring a deeper cut of 50 basis points. 
Miran was sworn in earlier this week, amid criticism from Democrats that he would not separate economic decision making from political pressure.

The other 11 voting members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted for the quarter-point cut.
Trump has been pushing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who acts independently of the White House, to cut interest rates for months.
He has tried to pressure Powell to resign and has openly considered firing him.
Powell said Wednesday the Fed was "right to wait and see how tariffs and inflation and the labor market evolved" before lowering rates.
He added the the central bank was "strongly committed" to maintaining its independence from politics.
On Tuesday, Democrats introduced a Senate bill aimed at reinforcing the separation between the White House and the Federal Reserve, just hours after Miran was sworn in as a Fed governor.

Meanwhile, an appeals court upheld an injunction allowing Governor Lisa Cook to participate, despite ongoing efforts by the Trump administration to remove her.
Fed officials signaled that they expect to reduce their key rate twice more this year, but just once in 2026.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Kenya's pension and health insurance systems were meant to bring people dignity in old age. But fraud, delays and broken promises have left retirees and patients paying with their savings — and even their lives.

For decades, Kenya's public pension and health insurance systems have promised workers security in retirement and protection during illness.
But for many citizens, these promises have now turned into frustration and betrayal as the money they faithfully contributed has ended up in the pockets of fraudsters within the system.
In 2024, a report by Auditor General Nancy Gathungu revealed more than 260,000 cases of fraudulent activities targeting pension schemes in Kenya.
Between 2013 and 2020, over 67 billion Kenyan shillings ($515 million, €442 million) were lost through fake pension scheme payments.
Meanwhile, legitimate retirees have been left empty-handed, and older people are passing away while still waiting to receive the pensions they worked so hard for.

One person DW spoke with declined to be quoted for this story, fearing that speaking out would doom any remaining chance of ever receiving what their family is still owed.
John Wachira, the secretary general of the Kenya Association of Retired Officers, however, does speak out.
"When you join the pension scheme, you're promised that when you retire, you will get your pension. And it will be regularly reviewed, so that if salaries are increased, your pension will also be reviewed. But that does not happen," he told DW.
Instead of enjoying the fruits of their labor, retired Kenyans are still facing chronic delays, requests for bribes and opaque processes that leave them feeling powerless.

Public deductions, private burdens
Payments to the country's pension and health insurance schemes are mandatory for Kenyans; you cannot opt out. Pension contributions are made through the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), and health insurance is provided via the Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF).
However, many Kenyans feel forced to pay for private insurance on top of the public insurance to ensure they receive the care they need when required. But this option is mostly limited to the middle and upper classes, as many Kenyans can't afford to pay twice.
Wachira argues people expect a pension to ensure that "when you leave the service, you maintain a certain standard" — the same standard, he said, when you are in service, and which shouldn't "drop down because of inflation."
If contributions are mandatory and consistent, but payouts aren't, where does the money go?


How pension frauds drained funds
The 2024 Auditor General's report painted senior officials managing the pension scheme as fraudsters who colluded within the National Treasury to steal from the fund through nonexistent persons and double payments to duplicate accounts.
Around 15,000 people benefited from fraudulent pension payments totaling over $15 million, according to the report.
Some of these payments went to individuals who started receiving pension payments even before they had officially retired. Some received payouts despite not following the right procedures. Others were given a payout without being registered at all, as they were only added to the system later to cover their tracks in case they were audited.
The report also highlighted issues with delays, bureaucracy and systemic data weaknesses, like a lack of proper identification and missing records.
Auditors found serious systemic loopholes in the pension scheme, with irregularities found in nearly all major ministries, including those for foreign affairs, social protection and the judiciary.
For those who do end up receiving their pensions, they claim that the pay does not reflect the inflation situation in the country.

The scale of the problem is difficult to measure, as there are no concrete formal records of those affected, and most cases go unreported. But based on multiple accounts, the issue affects people across different segments of society from the lower to the middle class.
In a recent case that sparked nationwide anger, a retired teacher, Violet Akoth Nyatol, lost over 2,400,000 Kenyan shillings in pension payouts after corrupt pension officials colluded with bank staff to divert her benefits.
In Kenya, this would have been enough to buy a small plot of land in her hometown.
Health insurance funds also blundered
In what's been another devastating blow to government credibility, Health Cabinet Secretary Aden Duale has recently admitted that the health insurance scheme was also the target of fraud.
On July 1, Duale announced that 35 hospitals across the country are accused of stealing over $804 million from the health tax fund to which Kenyans contribute.
Fraud and corruption within Kenya's public health insurance system have been ongoing issues since the establishment of the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) in 1966, with various scandals over the decades highlighting systemic weaknesses and mismanagement.
In 2024, NHIF was replaced by the Social Health Authority (SHA), which aimed to introduce a more comprehensive health insurance system with multiple schemes to improve access and affordability.
But the new authority is already grappling with cases of corruption, fraud and mismanagement.

In a post on X in late August, Duale noted that the fraudulent claims to the SHA included "falsifying records, inflating and phantom billing, upcoding (when a provider bills for a more expensive procedure) and converting outpatient visits into costly inpatient claims."

Geoffrey Mwaniki feels cheated after an experience at an Kenyan hospital.
He was admitted to Moi Referral Hospital in Eldoret on July 1 and was forced to cover his own bills out of pocket despite making monthly contributions to the SHA fund.
Speaking with DW, Mwaniki said that SHA denied him the code he needed to release the necessary funds, telling him that "the system was down," which was why "the password to release the funds could not be generated."
When the system came back on, he said, SHA acknowledged his request but argued they would "not be handling cases that had been submitted while the system was down."
The problem was not "by coincidence, but it was by design," said Mwaniki, suspecting the frequent breakdowns of the system were meant to "keep patients from accessing their money."

"It really killed me, because I had to borrow some money to offset my bill so that I may be discharged from the hospital," he said.
If he had a choice, he wouldn't have SHA insurance, he added but unfortunately, "it is mandatory."
Is digitalization a possible fix or another empty promise?
To end widespread delays and fraud targeting retirees, the Kenyan government promised to fully digitize the pension payment system from July 1, 2025.
Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi told Kenyan Senate lawmakers that the current manual system not only delays pension disbursements but also exposes retirees to sophisticated fraud schemes.
However, the public unrest that began earlier this year shows that many Kenyans have already lost confidence in the government's policies, including in the social security systems that are mandatory to pay into to but don't always pay out.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Anti-Trump protesters in the UK get creative as King Charles III hosts Donald Trump for his second UK state visit.

US President Donald Trump landed in the United Kingdom late Tuesday for his much-touted second state visit that comes amid criticism of Trump's policies and his murky past with the late financier and abuser Jeffrey Epstein.
Creativity in protest
The political campaign group Led By Donkeys, who combine art and activism, confirmed that they were behind the public stunt which saw several images of Trump and Epstein projected on to a tower, while a soundtrack questioning the relationship between the two men was played on a speaker.
"Trump is being welcomed to our country, being given the unique honor of a second state visit, and it's being housed at our expense at Windsor Castle," a spokesperson for the group told British newspaper The Guardian, adding that they felt that US president's "incredibly close links to America's most notorious child sex trafficker" shouldn't be left out of the discussion. 

Trump is under increasing pressure following the release of a note that he allegedly signed, in which he wishes the sex offender happy birthday and alludes to "wonderful secrets."
Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in a federal jail in New York in 2019 after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges, which he'd denied. His accomplice, former British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, is serving a 20-year prison term for crimes related to procuring underage girls whom Epstein sexually abused.
After the images of Trump and Epstein were projected on to Windsor Castle, four people were arrested on suspicion of "malicious communications following a public stunt in Windsor." They remain in custody, according to Thames Valley Police.
"We projected a piece of journalism on to a wall and now people have been arrested for malicious communications. I think that, frankly, says a lot more about the policing of Trump's visit than it does about what we did," added the Led By Donkeys spokesperson.

An activist group called Everyone Hates Elon also unveiled what they call the "world's largest photo" of Trump and Epstein just outside Windsor Castle ahead of Trump's stay. The massive banner display has since been removed.
'Donald Trump not welcome here'
About 70 protesters from the Stop Trump Coalition also gathered outside Windsor Castle on Tuesday to demonstrate peacefully against Trump; it was the first in a series of planned demonstrations against the US president throughout his stay, which ends on Thursday.
People held up placards and banners condemning the president, chanting "Trump out" and "Say it loud, say it clear: Donald Trump not welcome here."

Speaking to The Guardian, Jake Atkinson, spokesperson for the Stop Trump Coalition, said: "Donald Trump's politics are politics of fascism and authoritarianism. Not only are we making our voices heard in opposition to Trump and his politics, but we want to send a signal to our government, that this is not how the British people feel, it's not what the British people want."
"We want to stand in solidarity with people in the US, with people in Palestine, with people in Ukraine, and with people all over the world who are seeing Trump's politics do damage to our democracy and to our planet."

As with the protests that took place in London during Trump's first state visit in 2019, placards have shown both creative word play and downright directness. Some have even capitalized on Trump's propensity to describe favorable things as "great," while others simply let the pictures do the talking.


Absent Windsor resident
Some placards featured references to Prince Andrew, King Charles' younger brother, who lives at the Royal Lodge located at Windsor Great Park. He will however be a notable absentee during this state visit and is reportedly also not on the guest list for the lavish state dinner.
Commentators have said that the palace wants to distance itself from Andrew, given the possibility of more incriminating evidence being revealed as the US House Committee releases thousands of Epstein files. 
Some protesters made jokes about Trump's relationship with Britain's Prince Andrew, who just like Trump was connected to Jeffrey EpsteinImage: Kin Cheung/AP Photo/picture alliance
The late Queen Elizabeth II had stripped him of his His Royal Highness (HRH) and military titles and removed him from public-facing duties after his 2019 bombshell interview with the BBC, where he detailed his friendship with Epstein, which led to legal action in the US. 
Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's most prominent accusers, who took her own life this year, had alleged that Epstein had introduced her to Prince Andrew when she was 17, and that the latter had sexually abused her three times.
The prince, who has denied all claims against him, reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022, which contained no admission of liability or apology.

'Not a laughing matter anymore'
Meanwhile, one of the most recognizable artifacts of the protests during Trump's 2019 state visit will not be making an appearance this time. 
The "Trump Baby" blimp, created by Leo Murray and co-designed by artist Matt Bonner, was an orange inflatable that depicted Trump as an angry baby wearing a nappy and holding a mobile phone.
It first floated over London's Parliament Square in July 2018 when people protested the planned Trump visit; it was flown for a second time during his state visit in June 2019 that also witnessed mass protests.

Speaking to The Independent, Murray explained: "Back in 2019, Donald Trump was a figure of fun for the British public. Most people thought he was an idiot, and we were amazed that the American people had elected this guy to be the president."
But the man behind the "Trump Baby" blimp feels that the political climate is different today, and it is "not really a laughing matter anymore," adding that after the 2019 protests, people involved with the blimp had received death threats and were tracked down at their places of work by far-right activists.
The blimp now belongs to the Museum of London, and will be unveiled next year when the museum opens its new home.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Germany's national basketball teams are enjoying a golden era, but are there concerns domestically that NIL money from US colleges might impact future generations.

After Germany beat Turkey to win the Eurobasket crown on Sunday, there can be no doubt that the country is enjoying its greatest-ever era of basketball.
Just two years after winning the World Championship and one year on from Germany's women winning gold in the 3x3 at the Paris Olympics, the glory days continued as NBA stars Franz Wagner and Dennis Schröder helped Germany take the EuroBasket. The success was Germany's second-ever EuroBasket title, and Schröder was named the tournament MVP for his efforts.
While eight of the 12 players in Germany's title squad play for professional teams abroad, including three in the NBA, domestic basketball in Germany has gone from strength to strength in recent years. The Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) has become one of the continent's most stable and exciting domestic leagues, and German teams are slowly establishing themselves in European competitions, too.


But there are concerns that four years after colleges and universities in the United States introduced the NIL (Name Image Likeness) provision for student athletes, the landscape is rapidly changing for European basketball teams.
The impact of NIL on European basketball
After a long-standing resistance to allowing student athletes to profit from their own image, the dam was broken in 2021 when NIL was introduced. The policy allows US college athletes to earn money through sponsorships, endorsements and social media without affecting their amateur status.
As a result, amateurism, a longtime hallmark of US college sports, has slowly become a thing of the past. In June, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the organization that operates college sports, reached a settlement with the House of Representatives that opened the door for colleges to pay their student athletes directly. 
The money on offer at many of the top sports colleges in the US is, in a basketball context, akin to the salaries in the EuroLeague, Europe's top club competition. This is changing the entire structure of basketball development across Europe and poses serious challenges for the future of German basketball.
The BBL has the 6+6 regulation, which requires at least six German players to be on the 12-man roster. Robert Wintermantel is head of sports and finance for the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL). The former player was instrumental in implementing the rule and remains a staunch supporter of it even in the face of a changing landscape.
"Of course, some talented players are currently leaving clubs to join the NCAA. This will be a transitional phase because many of them will come back," Wintermantel told DW. "I am definitely in favor of leaving the 6+6 rule as it is."
Hannes Steinbach, a 19-year-old forward who last played for the Würzburg Baskets, is a great example. Just seven months after making his Bundesliga, he announced he was opting to play for Washington University, the same university German basketball legend Detlef Schrempf attended. Steinbach, one of the Germany's most promising players, will not be the face of the new Bundesliga season, instead honing his craft on the other side of the world.

Wintermantel recognizes that talent leaving to the US presents a positive opportunity for young players to play, study and learn more of the American basketball mentality.
"I think these are all very positive things for the individual players, and as a league, we should not try to put obstacles in their way," Wintermantel said.
Should US colleges compensate European clubs for players?
At the same time, Wintermantel also favors clubs receiving compensation for the players they develop.
"The clubs have excellently trained these players, and the league has also made an important contribution to this development by introducing standards in the youth sector."

FIBA, basketball's global governing body, is reportedly seeking to sit down with the NCAA to try to reach a deal regarding compensation for European clubs. Whether that is possible and what this might look like remains unclear.
"There is so much money in the NCAA system that a solution for training compensation must now be found together with FIBA," Wintermantel said.
Part of the issue is; where would the compensation come from? There are over 360 division one colleges playing in 31 conferences. There isn't one governing body to negotiate directly with. 


Domestic basketball in danger?
Wintermantel described the development of basketball as "incredible" and said that the BBL has been growing steadily for decades. He admits that it is not ideal for the league to lose a talent like Steinbach, but that will not change the solid foundation that German basketball has built for itself.
"I believe we have a very good time ahead of us, as there are already many other exceptional talents who will follow in the footsteps of this golden generation. It is important for us that we are now a basketball nation that must be taken very seriously," he said.
Wintermantel hopes the current boom in German basketball will lead to increased media coverage, which in turn would lead to more sponsorships — and more money. Then the BBL could offer more to keep players at home a bit longer or bring them back sooner. 
"Basketball deserves it," he said.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[DW's Berlin Fresh and The Washington Post Universe's TikTok teams collaborate to explore the perks of living in Berlin and Germany.

Considering a move to Europe?
The German capital has long been an attractive destination for young Americans wanting to try a new life abroad. Now even more of them are flocking to Berlin as they seek an alternative to living in the US under the Trump administration.
Washington Post Universe TikTok host Carmella Boykin teamed up with DW's Berlin Fresh to explore the perks of living in Germany. 


Here's more on some of the benefits they mention in the video:

Are universities in Germany free? 
While tuition fees in the United States can cost tens of thousands of dollars per year, public universities in Germany generally offer tuition-free education to both domestic and international students, even for many English-taught programs. Students are typically required to pay a small semester fee (around €100-€300) to cover administrative costs.
As a registered student, you also get access to free or discounted public transportation, so the semester fee truly feels like a symbolic sum.

There are exceptions, however. Some German federal states, such as Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria, charge tuition fees to non-EU students, going up to €1,500 ($1,750). 
There are also specialized master's programs, as well as other programs offered by private universities, that require tuition fees.
How does health insurance work in Germany?
You need to get health insurance in Germany; it's mandatory.
The costs can vary according to whether you choose a public or private health insurance. Generally speaking, public health insurance covers necessary healthcare, and is considered the safest option.
As mentioned in the TikTok reel, if you're an employee, a contribution to your health insurance is paid by your employer and another part directly comes off your paycheck each month. The standard contribution is 14.6% of your salary, and there are supplementary contributions depending on the insurer; these contributions are split equally between employer and employee.
If you are studying and under 30 years old, you will pay the student tariff, which is around €140 per month.
If you are self-employed, you will also pay the standard rate of 14.6% on your income plus the insurance provider's additional contribution, with minimum costs of around €230 ($272) per month and going up to a maximum of €1,200. The sum is paid by bank transfer every month.
10 fun facts about health in Germany

Young and healthy people might be tempted to sign up with a private insurance provider. Their contracts can be more affordable than a public plan on a monthly basis. But keep in mind that even though basic private health insurance programs can work well for short-term expats, they often lack coverage for health services for pre-existing conditions, psychotherapeutic treatment, treatment related to sexually transmitted diseases, gender reassignment treatment, and more.
It is basically impossible to switch back to public health insurance later on if you are self-employed, so this is an important decision to take. Who knows, your short-term German adventure as an expat might lead to a permanent home!


How much paid vacation do you get in Germany?
The US has no national requirement for paid holidays, vacation days or paid sick days.
Meanwhile, in Germany, the legal minimum of paid vacation days for full-time employees is set at 20 days, making it one the countries with the most days of annual leave in the world. Many employers offer even more days off per year.
The European Union has ruled that all employees are entitled to at least four weeks of paid holiday per yearImage: Stefan Sauer/dpa/picture alliance

On top of that come between 10 to 13 paid public holidays per year, depending on the federal state.
And with all those days off, you might find more time to party. The Washington Post's TikTok host Carmella Boykin already started exploring the clubs she should visit in Berlin. In an upcoming video, she learns about clubbing options beyond the legendary Berghain.
Correction, September 19, 2025: This article did not properly state the standard contribution to public health insurance, which is of 14.6%. We apologize for the error.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The Eurovision Song Contest is supposed to be apolitical. But Israel is now at the center of calls for boycott and protests, due to the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.

Following announcements from Ireland, Slovenia, the Netherlands and Iceland, Spain became on Wednesday the first country among the "Big Five," the five largest contributors to the Eurovision Song Contest, to officially declare its decision to boycott the 2026 event to be held in Vienna from May 12-16, if Israel's participation goes ahead as planned.
The "Big Five" countries are Spain, Germany, the UK, France and Italy.
The country's withdrawal was approved by a majority of the board of directors of Spanish state broadcaster RTVE, with 10 votes in favour, four against and one abstention.
The vote came after Spanish Minister for Culture, Ernest Urtasun, stated last week that Spain should withdraw from the event if Israel remained on the list of participating countries.
Dutch public broadcaster AVROTROS also stated that it could "no longer justify Israel's participation in the current situation, given the ongoing and severe human suffering in Gaza."
A decision on Israel's participation in the 2026 event is expected in December.

Why is Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest?
Israel made its debut at Eurovision in 1973, when it was still called the "Grand Prix d'Eurovision de la Chanson." That was when the country became a member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), an association including 73 active members of broadcasters from 56 countries and 35 associate members from 21 countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.


Israel isn't the only non-European participant in the contest. There's also Armenia and Azerbaijan — and since 2015, Australia has become the "most exotic" Eurovision competitor. The show has a huge fan base there, and Australia was accepted into the EBU as an associate member. 
The inclusion of broadcasters and countries beyond the borders of Europe is also the reason why the event is called the "Eurovision Song Contest" and not the "European Song Contest." 
With four first places, Israel is one of Eurovision's most successful participants.
But the Israel-Palestine conflict has impacted the contest several times over the past five decades.

Security for Israeli contestants 
In 1973, Ilanit was the first artist to compete for Israel. Strict security measures were implemented because, only a few months earlier, Palestinian terrorists had killed 11 Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village in the German city of Munich.
Ilanit was supposedly wearing a bulletproof vest, and the audience had to remain seated throughout her performance. Photographers had to take a picture pointing at the ceiling to prove that their cameras were not disguised firearms.
In 2024, Israeli contestant Eden Golan also performed under special protection.
Several participating countries had also called on the EBU to exclude Israel from that year's contest. The EBU considered it, but not because of the Gaza war itself.
EBU officials feared the original title of Israel's entry, "October Rain," was too explicit a reference to the event that triggered the Gaza war: the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, in which around 1,200 Israelis were killed and 240 were taken hostage in Gaza. Once the lyrics of the song were changed, Golan's participation was allowed to go ahead.

Fines for pro-Palestinian protests
The repeated use of protest symbols and slogans by the audience or by artists hasn't gone unpunished. This became particularly clear during the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest, which was held in Tel Aviv, Israel.
On the evening of the final, the Icelandic band Hatari held up scarves with Palestinian flags to the camera, causing controversy. The EBU fined the Icelandic broadcaster RUV the sum of €5,000 ($5,900).
During a performance by global superstar Madonna that same evening, a male dancer and a female dancer — one carrying the Israeli flag and the other carrying the Palestinian flag — walked up the stairs arm in arm.
Madonna later said that this was a "message of peace and unity." But the EBU was less enthusiastic about it.
Although there was no fine in this case, the contest organizers released a statement saying the act was not cleared with them and that Madonna was aware the contest was non-political.  
The competitions in Malmö, Sweden, in 2024 and Basel, Switzerland, in 2025 also witnessed protests critical of Israel. In the hall, audience members whistled and booed the Israeli performers.

The organizers of the Flanders Festival Ghent in Belgium were open about why they decided to cancel a planned concert by the Munich Philharmonic: The reason, they said, was that its Israeli conductor, Lahav Shani, had not sufficiently distanced himself from the actions of Israel's government.
By canceling the event, the organizers say they wanted "to maintain the serenity" of the festival and that it is their "deepest conviction that music should be a source of connection and reconciliation." 
But instead of serenity, the move has triggered a wave of outrage — especially in Germany.
Munich Philharmonic cancellation 'deeply antisemitic act'
Many German politicians and antisemitism experts swiftly condemned the music festival's decision.
Germany's Minister of State for Culture, Wolfram Weimer, called the move "a dangerous precedent," describing it as "pure antisemitism and an attack on the fundamentals of our culture."
The German Commissioner for Antisemitism, Felix Klein, also sharply criticized the decision. "I consider the cancellation, based on the stated reasons, to be a completely unspeakable and deeply antisemitic act," he told the German dpa press agency.
The former President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Charlotte Knobloch, called the cancellation one of the "most blatant examples of current Jew-hatred."
"Anyone who fails to hear the historical echo in this situation is turning a deaf ear," she told dpa, referring to the anti-Jewish boycotts under the Nazis.
Conductor Shani calls Gaza war a 'catastrophe'
In a statement sent to the press five days after the cancellation, Lahav Shani criticized the festival's "regrettable decision" through which he was "involuntarily drawn into an unexpected public storm that quickly escalated into a diplomatic incident."
In his statement, he also reiterates his position on the situation in Gaza.
"Like many Israelis, I have not abandoned my human values. The images and reports from Gaza are deeply disturbing, and it is impossible to remain indifferent in the face of the catastrophe that this war has brought upon the civilian population in Gaza," he writes.

"Everything must be done to end the war as soon as possible and begin the long process of healing and reconstruction for both societies."

Other theaters continue with Philharmonic concerts
In reaction to the cancelled performance, the Berliner Konzerthaus organized a last-minute concert held on Monday. 
"We can never let the program of European stages be dictated by antisemites," Culture Commissioner Weimer said in a speech at the concert.
"We are the Europe of the Enlightenment, not the Europe that the Nazis betrayed 90 years ago," he added, referring to the Nuremberg laws to introduced in 1935 to discriminate against Germany's Jewish population, which culminated in the Holocaust. 
Other European theaters scheduled to host the Munich Philharmonic and Lahav Shani in the same week as the Flanders Festival have said they won't follow Ghent's example. 
The Philharmonie Luxembourg, which is hosting a concert directed by Shani on September 17, said in a statement to DW: "We uphold our position of continuing to work with artists from all over the world. We do not wish to associate ourselves with a boycott of individuals based on nationality, as we do not believe that all artists support or are tied to the policies of their government."


Who is Lahav Shani?
Born in Tel Aviv in 1989, Lahav Shani is considered one of classical music's brightest young stars. A conductor, pianist and double bassist, he succeeded Zubin Mehta as director of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra in 2019.
Since 2016, Shani has also been chief conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic.
Although he is already directing concerts with the Munich Philharmonic, he will officially become the new chief conductor of the German orchestra starting in September 2026. He will then step down from the Rotterdam position but remain director of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.

Shani called in the past for peace
For much of his career, Shani was cautious about making political statements.
In a 2024 guest essay for German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, he explained that as the conductor of the Israeli Philharmonic orchestra — with musicians from diverse backgrounds and with often opposing views — he didn't feel it was his role to speak out on behalf of any one side. 
But that changed in March 2023, he wrote in the essay, when mass protests against planned judicial reforms by Benjamin Netanyahu's government could be heard outside a Tel Aviv concert hall where Shani was about to perform. That night, he voiced his concerns onstage about the future of Israeli democracy. 
Shani also wrote about the shock of realizing that Jews couldn't feel safe even in Israel after the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023 — a fear shared by many other Jewish people around the world. 
Yet he also expressed hope "that on both sides very courageous people will soon come forward, people who think about the future and dare to take the difficult steps towards peace." 

Are cultural boycotts constructive?

While the Flanders Festival Ghent acknowledged that "Lahav Shani has spoken out in favor of peace and reconciliation several times in the past," the organizers argued that he had not gone far enough "in the light of his role as the chief conductor of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra." 
PEN Berlin, the local branch of an international writers' association dedicated to free expression, strongly disagrees.
In a statement, PEN Berlin spokesperson Thea Dorn said: "Freedom of expression is not only the right to express oneself freely and without fear of reprisal; it also includes the right not to be forced to express one's beliefs. Coercion to confess is a hallmark of authoritarian and even more so totalitarian regimes."

Can Shani's case be compared to Valery Gergiev's?
The debate over Shani Lahav has sparked comparisons with Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, who was dismissed by the Munich Philharmonic in March 2022 after refusing to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
Jewish pianist Igor Levit, a globally renowned artist known for his outspoken stance against xenophobia and antisemitism, rejected the comparison.
"Valery Gergiev is an artist who has been an open, committed supporter, collaborator and profiteer of the Russian imperialist dictator's machinations for years. Comparing this man to Lahav Shani — a conductor who, with his German orchestra, only got into this situation because he is an Israeli Jew — is, in my view, a sign of intellectual bankruptcy," Levit noted in an interview with German news service Tagesthemen. 
Gergiev had long been a vocal supporter of the Kremlin, appearing in a 2012 campaign advertisement for Vladimir Putin and endorsing the annexation of Crimea. Gergiev is currently the director of the Mariinsky Theater and the Bolshoi Theater in Russia.

Even so, PEN Berlin highlighted some similarities, with its spokesperson Dorn noting: "Gergiev and Shani may have very different levels of closeness to their respective governments, yet the accusations leveled against them are similar: It's not about things they said, but about things they didn't say. Cancel culture and forced political affiliation are fundamentally to be rejected, and not just when they fit one's ideological concept." 
'A cultural boycott is always wrong'
The Shani affair is part of a wider international debate. Many public personalities have been hesitant to speak out on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — both because of its complexity and the fear that criticizing Israel publicly could have professional consequences.

In Germany, there has been a rise in cancellations of artists and intellectuals whose stance on Israel's policies was seen as too critical. This practice has also impacted a large number of Jewish voices. 
Jewish-Austrian author Eva Menasse has been a vocal opponent of such boycotts. She told DW that "cultural boycotts are always wrong." She argued that they are used by groups to reaffirm their respective moral stances, but they're only a distraction from the political steps that need to be taken.
"Will a disinvited orchestra prevent the ongoing, monstrous destruction of Gaza? Will it save a single child from starvation? No, of course not. Only politics can do that," Menasse said. "At the same time, cultural boycotts always lead to more polarization and division in society."

Menasse also pointed to a double standard, asking why those who are now condemning the Ghent cancellation were silent when Jewish intellectuals and artists who were critical of Israel were disinvited elsewhere.
She cited Israeli-German philosopher Omri Boehm, whose speech for the 80th anniversary of the Buchenwald concentration camp's liberation was canceled after objections by the Israeli ambassador, and the controversy over awarding the Hannah Arendt Prize to Masha Gessen, after the journalist compared Gaza to Nazi-era ghettos in an article for the New Yorker magazine. 
The controversy over the Ghent festival's cancellation has shown once again how quickly culture and politics become entangled — while some view boycotts as a legitimate form of protest, others warn that they often deepen divisions and risk silencing important voices.
Navigating the complex debates over artistic expression and political accountability will likely remain a major challenge for cultural institutions in a deeply divided world.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Clean, green hydrogen energy has long been hyped as the key to decarbonizing big industries like steel. But as projects are cancelled and investments dry up, what went wrong?
    Green hydrogen has been hyped as a clean solution for long-distance trains that often rely on diesel fuel Image: Tim Schauenberg/DW   
In 2022, the Australian mining and energy company Fortescue signed a deal with E.On, a German energy network and infrastructure operator, to supply up to five million tons of low-emission green hydrogen to Europe annually.
"The race for large-scale production and transportation of green hydrogen has taken off," said Robert Habeck, then German minister for economic affairs and climate action, of the deal, adding that it would be the start of a "future without fossil fuels."
climate-wrecking coal power, hydrogen has been the subject of plenty of hype.
But three years after reaching agreement, the German-Australian deal is dead. E.On has since retreated from investment in large-scale green hydrogen infrastructure and has slashed import targets.
"International hydrogen imports, hydrogen production, and midstream activities will be deprioritized," E.On spokesperson Alexander Ihl told DW.

And it's not the only sign of a mismatch between ambition and reality. The EU was planning to produce 10 million tons and import another 10 million tons of renewable hydrogen per annum by 2030. But Jun Sasamura, hydrogen manager at energy research company Westwood Global Energy, said in a statement that only 17% of the bloc's planned hydrogen projects will be realized by decade's end.
"The gap between ambition and reality in Europe's hydrogen sector is widening," he said.
The broader retreat from green hydrogen was typified in late July, when oil and gas giant BP cancelled its $36 billion (€31 billion) investment in a renewable energy and green hydrogen project in Western Australia.
"This decision reflects BP's recent strategy reset, which will see BP grow its upstream oil and gas business, focus its downstream business, and invest with increasing discipline into the transition," a BP spokesperson said in a statement.


So what went wrong?
Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, is a colorless, odorless and nontoxic gas consisting of a single proton and a single electron. It is also highly combustible, with each kilo containing about 2.4 times as much energy as natural gas, hence its manifold uses.

The green variation, as the name suggests, is made with renewables. But there has always been a catch. Because it takes so much green or renewable power to produce, it is very expensive to generate at scale.
"Most of the cost of green hydrogen comes from the cost of electricity, and while the cost of green electricity has been falling fast, it has to fall a lot further before hydrogen is cost-competitive with other fuels," noted Alison Reeve, program director, energy and climate change at Australia-based think tank, the Grattan Institute.
Part of the problem is a reliance on dwindling government subsidies and support to build enough renewable energy to power the technology, she explained. Competition from cheaper alternatives like natural gas is further depressing demand.
One example is Luxembourg-based steel conglomerate ArcelorMittal. The company recently withdrew from a plan to make its two German steelworks carbon-neutral by 2050 using green hydrogen, and even handed back €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) in subsidies due to a blow-out in costs.

"There's no question that scaling green hydrogen, particularly as an export product, presents real challenges," Dino Otranto, Fortescue Metals and Operations CEO, told DW. "We are operating within a system with limited infrastructure, policy uncertainty and a regulatory environment that is still evolving."
"Until we invest in low-cost, large-scale electricity infrastructure, we won't unlock the full potential of hydrogen," he added.
Does green hydrogen have a future?
Fortescue, one of the world's biggest miners of iron ore used to create steel, is now focusing its renewable hydrogen business on green iron and ammonia — a fertilizer created by mixing hydrogen and nitrogen.
"Green hydrogen remains the most viable pathway to produce green iron at scale," said Otranto, adding that no other technologies can deliver "the emissions reductions we need."
But Alison Reeve says green hydrogen will likely only ever occupy a "niche" in the clean energy mix. 
"There are some advances in ore smelting using electricity directly, rather than turning it into hydrogen first," she noted.
And in terms of long-distance transport, batteries are becoming a viable option, as are several different fuels for long-distance shipping such as e-methanol. 
"So the role of hydrogen is not going to be the 'everything, everywhere, all at once' fuel," she said.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[If strong enough, solar storms could wipe out our internet infrastructure. They disrupt aviation signals and, for example, the smooth running of petroleum pipelines in Nigeria.

The intensity of solar storms is classified into five levels by the US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): G1-G5. The G stands for the geomagnetic effects triggered by the plasma cloud. Level 5 corresponds to a very strong effect, while level 1 corresponds to a "minor" effect.
Now and then, a solar storm rushes to Earth, prompting a barrage of articles warning about potential disruption of the global power supply and phone and satellite communication.
These claims can be overhyped. But it would be a mistake to fully dismiss them as mere alarmism.

Peak in 2025
The sun has an 11-year solar cycle, with the current one peaking in 2025. When the sun's cycle peaks, flares become more intense and extreme.
Our internet communication structure is vulnerable to violent solar storms, according to a 2021 University of California-Irvine study.
According to author Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi, if a particularly strong solar storm crashed into the Earth, it would have the power to not only disrupt power grids and satellites, but also to paralyze the internet long term. She said our internet infrastructure is not designed to withstand severe solar storms.
Communication via unprotected satellites (like GPS navigation systems) and undersea cable repeaters, which are installed every 50 to 150 kilometers to amplify communication signals over long connection routes, is especially vulnerable. A very strong electromagnetic interference could completely paralyze the sensitive system.
And should the internet go down for just one day in the United States, the damage would be an estimated $7 billion (€6.9 billion) in the US alone.


What happens during a solar storm?
During a solar storm, the sun ejects large amounts of electrons and protons, causing a cloud of cosmic rays to fly toward the Earth.
By deforming the Earth's magnetic field, solar storms amplify the polar lights visible on the edges of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The charged particles of the solar wind are derived from the Earth's magnetic field and flow along the field lines to the Earth's poles, where they cause light bands or arcs of different colors north or south of the polar circles.

Earth hasn't seen the full impact of solar storms
As early as 1843, astronomer Samuel Heinrich Schwabe discovered that solar activity follows certain cycles, peaking about every 11 years.
The strongest solar storm measured on Earth to date was the so-called Carrington Event in 1859, when the arrival of the charged particles caused failures in North American and European telegraph networks and polar lights could be observed as far as Rome and Hawaii.
More than a hundred years later, in March 1989, a solar storm in the Canadian province of Quebec paralyzed the entire power grid. Flashovers in electrical distribution systems left some 6 million people sitting in the dark for nine hours.

In July 2012, an extremely powerful "Carrington"-caliber solar storm narrowly missed Earth, according to NASA.
"If the solar flare had happened just a week earlier, Earth would have been right in the line of fire," the NASA study said.

Suggestions for a more robust internet
An eruption like the Carrington Event could paralyze the digital infrastructure in large parts of the world within a few minutes. For months, if not years, Jyothi estimates, large areas would be without communications and power supply.
Jyothi also provides concrete suggestions on how the internet infrastructure could be made more robust. One possibility, she said, would be to shift the internet infrastructure to the south, for example to Central and South America, because the northern latitudes are more susceptible to solar storms.
She also suggests shorter and therefore more resilient internet connections, such as in Europe and Asia, and the implementation of additional overhead cables, which are less vulnerable than long submarine cables requiring many repeaters.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[新能源汽车充电的速度正在不断逼近燃油车加油的速度。
 
从慢充“进化”到快充，一辆车的充电时长从近十个小时缩短到一小时以内。如今，更高功率的充电设施让充电时长开始以分钟计。
 
缩短充电时间，这被认为是缓解新能源汽车里程焦虑的关键，也是当前车企“内卷”的主战场之一，而更大功率的充电设施是实现更短充电时间的基础。
 
在企业、地方政府已经对大功率充电设施投入极高热情的情况下，今年6月，国家发展改革委、国家能源局等部门印发《关于促进大功率充电设施科学规划建设的通知》 （下称《通知》），这是国家部委层面第一次针对大功率充电设施出台文件，其中最受关注的是，提出“适度超前”布局大功率充电设施，到2027年底，力争全国范围内大功率充电设施超过10万台。
 
“适度超前”的“度”如何把握，让大功率充电设施更好发挥其作用，同时避免过度投建，这可能是当前的焦点。
 



2023年6月30日，广东深圳市，2023国际数字能源展期间，南方电网与华为打造的会展中心全液冷超充示范站，为人们带来“一秒一公里”“一杯咖啡，满电出发”的超快充体验。图/IC
 
250千瓦充电桩，超前吗？
 
充电桩充电功率的高低，是影响充电速度快慢的关键因素。比如人们购车时获赠的充电桩，适配家用场景，使用交流电，充电功率多为7千瓦，给一辆装有70度电池的车充电，理论上充满需要十小时。
 
公共充电桩前期铺设的也是这样的交流慢充桩，随着直流快充桩逐步推广，功率从几十千瓦到上百千瓦不等，甚至达到兆瓦级别。这些被称为快充、超充、闪充的技术正在迅速落地。
 
重庆、广州、深圳等城市近年提出打造“超充之城”。深圳在2023年就明确了“超充之城”的短期目标：力争到2023年底，建成不少于150座公用超充站；2024年3月底前，建成不少于300座公用超充站。不过，何为超充，并没有统一定义。北京、深圳认定超充设备单枪额定功率不低于480千瓦。
 
当下人们究竟需要多大功率的充电设施？答案并非一味追求“大功率”。因为实现大功率充电，一方面取决于充电设施，另一方面也取决于车辆与电池技术。
 
“桩的能力可能会被车限制，反之亦然。比如车端充电承载能力，在很大程度上取决于电压平台。”清华四川能源互联网研究院光储直柔应用技术研究所副所长李立理告诉《中国新闻周刊》。
 
深圳将超充门槛设定在480千瓦就比较高，深圳市城市交通规划设计研究中心研究院副总工程师朱宏佳解释，这是由充电设施、新能源汽车、电力等领域专家基于技术条件、服务水平，以及电网承载力等因素综合讨论确定。
 
在他看来，深圳大功率充电设施技术条件比较成熟。2023年，深圳部分充电设施龙头企业，如华为数字能源、英飞源等均已推出600千瓦级别的充电桩产品，充电场站运营商也已开始配置120千瓦、240千瓦，甚至更大功率的充电设施。
 
反而是新能源汽车没有准备好。“据统计，今年5月全国基于800V平台打造的新能源汽车车型累计近180款，而2023年时仅有约30款，规模增长近5倍。”朱宏佳表示，800V高压平台能够匹配四五百千瓦功率的充电设施，更多车型与电池能够适配大功率充电设施。
 
受访者普遍认为，如果将充电设施视为一种基础设施，应该稳定提升充电设施功率，关注与市场多数车辆能否适配，服务尽可能多的车辆。
 
对于前述《通知》将250千瓦确定为大功率充电设施的充电功率门槛，国家发展和改革委员会能源研究所助理研究员付毕安告诉《中国新闻周刊》，这一规定主要是参照了2015年版充电国标和后续升级版（即“2015+”版）的相关技术指标。2015年版国标最大充电功率为250千瓦，而“2015+”版则将上限提升至800千瓦。
 
250千瓦功率充电设施究竟处于怎样的水平？50度电池，半小时左右可以充满。经历数轮技术迭代，目前越来越多的充电桩以及车辆与电池都能够支持250千瓦的充电功率。
 
付毕安告诉《中国新闻周刊》，当下正处于充电基础设施更新的节点。“相比于人们熟悉的一些铁路、公路等传统基础设施，充电基础设施使用寿命更短、技术迭代更快，一些2020年前投放的充电设施，其实已经来到更新换代的时点。”
 



2024年8月11日，在北京丰台丽泽商务区超级充电站，国网北京市电力公司技术人员示范液冷充电枪的使用方法。


建多少？建在哪里？
 
尽管从技术角度来讲实现没有难度，但依然存在大功率充电设施需要建多少的问题。《通知》特别提出，避免资源浪费和无序投建。
 
“车企每年新推出的车型，适配的充电功率不断提升，特别是中高端车型，普遍达到200千瓦以上。技术会从中高端车型向市场主流车型渗透，比如当前一些10万元左右的经济型车型，适配的充电功率也达到120千瓦以上。”李立理判断，在明后年，一些经济型车型的充电倍率也会达到3C、4C的水平，这意味着能够适配大功率充电设施，充电设施向大功率升级是必然趋势。
 
但问题的关键是升级的节奏，对于约四千万辆的存量新能源车而言，其中大部分难以享受到大功率充电设施的服务。李立理认为，“在过渡阶段没有必要将存量充电设施全部改造”。
 
充电设施过度投建，并非没有前车之鉴。“此前充电场站一度无序发展，出现‘僵尸站’‘僵尸桩’，以及一些场站利用率较低，充电桩每天平均利用时长可能只有一个多小时。”李立理认为，这与企业此前“跑马圈地”有关。他建议，政府未来需要引入总量动态调控机制，类似对于平台投放共享单车进行总量控制的政策。比如上海最近根据每个街道、乡镇的“车桩比”，将不同区域的充电设施饱和程度划分为三类进行总量管理。
 
截至今年6月底，深圳已建成1057座超充站，单站服务半径约一公里，基本能够覆盖全市八成以上建设用地。但是超充站的充电设施多是快充、超充结合，甚至快充设施可能占比更高。
 
朱宏佳表示，2023年，深圳开展超充规划时，测算了全市超充场站总规模。在此基础上，根据各区新能源汽车保有量、经济、人口等数据，确定了各区超充场站发展规模。同时，弹性化预留了升级扩能条件，未来随着特高压平台技术发展、电池技术提升，运营商可结合需求升级改造。
 
有业内人士向《中国新闻周刊》表示，超充车型多，不代表超充车多。超充车多，也不代表其进行超充的频次高。“其实在确定究竟该建多少大功率充电设施时，应该调取一些超充车辆的充电行为，关注这些车辆使用超充设施的频率，但是调取这些数据比较困难。”
 
大功率充电设施建设并非要颠覆现有的充电设施网络。截至2024年底，国内公共充电基础设施保有量达到357.9万台，《通知》提出的目标也并不激进，即到2027年底力争大功率充电设施超10万台，占比有限，而优先新建、改造的场景包括高速公路服务区、重大节假日期间利用率超过40％的充电设施等。
 
在当前，不同功率的充电设施各有其角色。深圳在布局超充设施时，居住、工作场景仍以慢充为主，在商业中心、交通枢纽等地超快充和慢充相结合，在城市公共停车场则以超快充为主。朱宏佳介绍，从实际使用情况来看，公共充电场站超充设备的使用率高于快充、慢充，特别是位于商业综合体、公园周边的超充设施。
 
朱宏佳认为，智能有序的慢充仍是主体，超充快充更多作为辅助。“从新能源汽车车主的补能习惯来看，人们还是习惯晚上到家后利用家充桩，在电价较便宜的夜间充电。在公共充电场站更多满足临时补能需求，更需要大功率充电设施减少等待时间，但是这并非主体。”
 
“从规划的角度来讲，希望形成慢充为主、超快充为辅的格局，这样对于电网的冲击可控，否则随着大功率充电设施的进一步普及，如果出现车辆到超快充站集中充电的情况，对于局部配电网的冲击比较大。”朱宏佳说。

土地与电网容量的挑战
 
充电设施建设需要土地和电网容量两个关键要素支撑。尤其是后者，常常被忽视。
 
比如，一些老旧小区规划时没有预见到新能源汽车充电需求，而小区电网容量有限，这意味着电网公司需要升级电网容量，或通过有序充电的方式提供充电服务。家用充电桩的功率多是7千瓦，几乎没有家用电器能够达到这样大的功率。按照现行《住宅建筑电气设计规范》，一套60至90平方米的住宅用电负荷是4千瓦。
 
“大功率充电设施可能会对电网造成较大的瞬时冲击。从实际情况来看，除去用电资源本就比较紧张的部分台区（指电力系统中由一台配电变压器供电的区域），深圳已经建成的1057座超充站对电网的冲击尚可承受。”朱宏佳表示，2023年深圳提出建设超充站时，南方电网曾评估站点建设对电网的影响。运营商申报建站时，电力部门会基于场站的报建功率，对所属台区的电网情况进行评估，减少其投运后对电网的冲击。
 
尽管从深圳的经验来看，当下的影响尚可控，但李立理认为，未来随着适配大功率充电设施的车辆越来越多，考虑单站满充情况，需要提升电网容量。如果场站容量在2兆瓦以内，现有配电网能够支撑，就可以降低充电场站接电成本。但是如果单站容量过大，就需要新建供电线路，这就涉及在城市建成区协调新的土地、管廊等资源。因此，需要控制单站规模，鼓励容量适中，如1兆瓦左右的场站分散布局，也能提高服务半径。
 
更大的难题是，在城市之外的高速公路服务区布局大功率充电设施，可能面临更多挑战。
 
李立理认为，高速服务区此前用电需求主要来自商业用电，充电需求使得服务区用电需求提升了一个数量级。特别是一些流量较大但远离城区的服务区，供电能力比较薄弱，充电需求又比较旺盛，考虑到未来重卡充电的需求，有必要将电力规划与物流通道规划协同考虑。
 
此次《通知》也提出，电网企业要积极开展大功率充电负荷特性对区域配电系统的影响研究，分层分级评估电网对大功率充电设施的接入能力。
 
重卡超充：真正的难题
 
“当前充电网络主要服务乘用车，而重卡补能其实是大功率充电设施一个非常重要的应用场景。”李立理表示。
 
随着重卡新能源转型加速，满足其充电需求正变得愈发重要，但是无论土地、电网容量，还是相关技术的投入，目前均有不足之处。
 
能源基金会交通项目主管杨佩佩告诉《中国新闻周刊》，针对重卡充电设施应该进行专项规划，特别是货运干线重卡充电设施规划。“在货运干线建设大功率充电设施，需要统筹场地用地条件和电力条件，场站选址也需要与物流枢纽、货运干线协同，通过制定重卡充电设施专项规划可以统筹协同各类资源，并且与相关电力规划、交通规划相衔接，将重卡充电对于电力、交通设施用地的需求纳入各自的相关规划中。”
 
这是因为，相比于乘用车，重卡充电设施所需的功率、分布、场站设计等存在显著差异。一些地方政府开始提出重卡大功率充电设施发展目标。比如，此前天津印发了国内首个电动重型货车充（换）电基础设施领域政策文件，提出到2025年，建成满足不少于1万辆电动重型货车需求的充（换）电基础设施；到2027年，建成满足不少于2万辆电动重型货车需求的充（换）电基础设施的发展目标。
 
从2024年开始，深圳开始推动建设以超快充为主的重卡充电设施，这是现实倒逼的结果。
 
2018年，深圳政府曾给予补贴，推动三四千辆燃油泥头车更换为电动泥头车。2024年下半年，深圳港口内的拖车，以及疏港集装箱货车开始电动化转型。一方面因国家实施了货车“以旧换新”补贴政策，另一方面，深圳物流特点与电动重卡的性能比较匹配。深圳的重卡主要服务于疏港运输，平均每天的运输距离为200—300公里，与当下主流搭载400度电池的重卡续航里程匹配。
 
朱宏佳告诉记者，“根据深圳市交通运输局反馈的数据，截至今年8月，深圳约有1000辆电动牵引重卡，近一年迎来可观增长”。
 
土地对于重卡充电设施建设是重要瓶颈。城市一般不会为重卡留出停车空间，重卡更多停放于物流园区、工厂，或是在港区周边的道路临时停放。
 
朱宏佳表示，在深圳电动重卡快速增长后，从充换电服务的角度来看，深圳服务于大型车辆的充电场站并未完全匹配。当前，深圳共有近20座充电站主要服务于重卡，主要服务2018年更换的电动泥头车，泥头车长约9米，牵引重卡带货柜后长度近20米，现有场站规模难以匹配牵引重卡需要。
 
目前充满搭载400度电池的重卡大约需要一个半小时，在深圳，一些车主会在晚间把重卡交给充电场站运营方，他们先将车辆停放在场站周边的停车场，等一批车辆完成充电后再进场充电。在场地有限，而且深圳地价较高的情况下，一些重卡充电场站在以这样特殊的方式运营。
 
此外，重卡大功率充电设施对于电网的冲击可能更为显著。“乘用车超充站装机功率在四五千千瓦的水平，而重卡超充站可能达到两三万千瓦的水平。而且乘用车充电不一定集中在某个时段，但是重卡充电集中在夜间，可能会对台区造成较大冲击。”朱宏佳表示。
 
李立理认为，重卡大功率充电设施对于电力容量的需求，相比于乘用车高出一倍以上，而且难以像乘用车充电场站那样，直接接入存量配电网。重卡充电场站往往在郊区等电网比较薄弱的地区，需要新建配电线路，甚至更高等级的变电站供电，因此配电网的升级改造是未来兆瓦级重卡充电场站建设的重要前提。
 
此外，重卡超充技术层面仍然有待突破。杨佩佩表示，《通知》提到，开展单枪兆瓦级充电技术研究与试点应用，但是产业界目前对于单枪兆瓦级充电技术并未过多投入。其对于车侧、桩侧的技术都提出更高要求，对于一些元器件的耐受程度也提出更高要求，电池也需要更高的充电倍率。
 
“再比如重卡充电接口的位置能否统一，国内缺少相应规范，位于车辆左侧、右侧，甚至后方的情况都有，应该尽可能统一，这样充电场站在设计时也能够统一布局。”杨佩佩说。
 
李立理认为，重卡正在重走乘用车走过的路，车侧与充电侧都处在技术升级、成本下降的进程中。乘用车充电基础设施走过的弯路，最好应通过科学规划，避免在重卡充电建设上重现。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[An email death threat marked the beginning of the end of one meteorologist's job. Experts say climate misinformation and conspiracy theories are fueling online hate.
    Gloninger enjoyed his job and sought to make the changing climate understandable to his audiences Image: privat   
One morning, Chris Gloninger opened his emails to find a message from a viewer asking for his home address, saying they wanted to give him a welcome he would remember.
"My heart raced, and I felt paralyzed," said Gloninger, who at the time was presenting the weather on a TV station in Des Moines, in the Midwestern US state of Iowa.
The email referenced the case of a man who had been arrested for attempted murder of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, after showing up at his house with a gun and zip ties.
For Gloninger, it was the final straw after a string of harassment since taking the job as chief meteorologist. He called the police and rushed to a hotel with his wife. 
Rise in online hate targeting weather forecasters
As some of the most visible faces of climate change communication, TV weather forecasters have come to face heat from the rise in misinformation and conspiracies fueling online hate. 
Viewing climate change as the most important issue of our time, Gloninger had actively championed its prominent inclusion in his TV work.

After taking the Des Moines job, he tailored coverage to the more climate-skeptical leanings of Iowa, a state which been a conservative stronghold since the first election of President Donald Trump in 2016. He tried to link it to everyday experiences such as how drought might impact farmers in the largely agricultural area. 
It was then that the emails started arriving in his inbox — at first the usual pushback and then ramping up to more aggressive threats. He noticed viewers were politicizing the science.
"They were saying, we're tired of this liberal agenda," said Gloninger. "It should never be about politics, because this is a science that has the support of 99% of its academic community."
A long history of misinformation 
Today, climate misinformation and conspiracies are rampant online. This is despite overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is causing more extreme weather that will only further escalate as global temperatures continue to rise. 
The roots of this can be traced back to the middle of the last century. Despite major fossil fuel companies uncovering the link between burning coal, oil and gas and global heating as early as the 1960s, many pursued an active strategy of denial and playing down the science.

But as glaciers have melted, sea levels have risen and dangerous weather has intensified, that denial has become a harder sell. So instead, experts say misinformation has shape-shifted into a form of "delayism" — either by casting doubt on climate solutions or greenwashing companies to give the false impression that they are environmentally friendly. 
Research in 2024 showed how fossil fuel and petrochemical companies spent millions on advertising that included misleading claims about their commitment to renewable energy. The sector actually spends just 1% of global investment on clean power and is actively exploring new oil and gas fields.

Complex web of misinformation actors 
The networks behind climate misinformation have become very intricate, said Ece Elbeyi, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.
It not only involves those with a vested interest in slowing climate action working with lobbyists and think tanks, but can include media outlets, trolls, Russian bot-farms, and influencers amplifying misinformation on social media platforms, where algorithms favor emotionally charged messaging.

Political actors, particularly those with nationalist or conservative platforms, have exploited misinformation to mobilize their base, said Elbeyi. "They might not explicitly deny climate change, but they frame climate solutions, like for instance international agreements or carbon regulations, as threats to national sovereignty or economic freedom."
Rallying against climate action has become an identity issue and therefore more difficult to challenge, said Elbeyi. Political identity, they added, is one reason a person might share misinformation or send angry messages to someone like Gloninger. 


Fertile ground for conspiracy theories 
Sometimes misinformation can veer into wild conspiracy theories, which can be particularly attractive to people with high levels of paranoia, insecurity or egocentricity, explained Daniel Jolley, an associate professor in psychology at the University of Nottingham.
Jolley said conspiracies can often make people feel more valued or comforted by painting another powerful group as "evil," adding that they often spike after disasters. 
In the wake of deadly flash flooding in Texas this summer, conspiracies surged online accusing scientists and government agencies of causing the disaster by manipulating the weather using cloud seeding.

"People are trying to explain issues that are massive, issues that make us feel uncertain, anxious and perilous," said Jolley. 
Jolley expects that because our climate is changing, misinformation and weather conspiracies will become increasingly prominent. 
Meteorologists are among the most visible when it comes to communicators of climate science and therefore often come to bear the brunt of attacks, he said. 
What can be done to stop misinformation? 
Both Jolley and Elbeyi see education as key to identifying misinformation.
Elbeyi said this must involve vulnerable groups in debates because the misinformation tends to thrive when groups feel decisions are made without, or even against, them. "And this exclusion can directly erode public trust in scientists and science more generally."
When it comes to conspiracy theories, building trust and being empathetic to why people may have those beliefs is a better tactic than debunking, said Jolley. He said support is also needed for those, like Gloninger, on the receiving end of abuse.

In the aftermath of the death threat, Gloninger sought therapy and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder — or PTSD. He couldn't sleep and his health deteriorated, leading to a skin condition.
The police caught the perpetrator and fined him $150 (€129). Meanwhile, back at the TV station, Gloninger continued his work. But after management received a flood of emails from what he calls a loud minority, he was told to stop mentioning climate change.
Gloninger made the choice to leave his job rather than stay and ignore climate change. He said he still finds the decision hard to talk about. 
Yet he did feel he made some impact in bringing climate change awareness to a new, conservative audience. He has kept a large folder filled with positive messages from viewers. 
He thinks it would be a mistake if climate communicators and weather reporters backed off now because of online hate. 
"I do think that there's less coverage of climate change because of the fear of retaliation," said Gloninger "And I encourage meteorologists to double down."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Europe's energy crisis may be fading, but Donald Trump's tariff threats on Russian gas buyers loom large. With no gas transiting through Ukraine this winter, can the continent afford to breathe a sigh of relief?

Brrrrr! Autumn’s chill is creeping in across much of Europe, hinting at the deep freeze to come this winter.
Fortunately, Gas Infrastructure Europe, the gas operators' association, reports that European Union gas reserves are at just over 80% [September 15, 2025] — lower than the 90% cushions of the last few years but stronger than 2021. So will this winter glow with warmth or flicker with uncertainty?
Having diversified energy supplies from Russia following Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, EU countries pivoted to liquified natural gas (LNG) from Norway, the United States and Qatar, while continuing to boost the rollout of renewable energies, including solar and wind.
Over the past two years, thanks to that extra capacity, Europe was able to ensure its gas reserves were almost full by September, providing an additional cushion for the coldest months of the year. Gas stocks should remain robust this winter, too.


Gas refill race seen as less critical
With the EU no longer in an acute energy crisis, Brussels is being flexible in giving EU gas stocks an extra month, till December 1, to reach 90% capacity, if required. Europe also used up more of its gas reserves last winter, leaving less of a surplus than usual.


Petras Katinas, energy analyst at the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air, says current storage levels and alternative supplies provide a "solid buffer" against supply disruptions. "But rapid withdrawals and weather volatility could still cause temporary price spikes or localized shortages," he told DW.
Complementing Europe’s internal resilience, global supply conditions and stable prices are also supporting the bloc's energy preparedness for winter.
According to Tom Marzec-Manzer, from the global research and consultancy house Wood Mackenzie, global energy supply is up this year, while demand — especially for gas — is likely weaker.
"That has been a real benefit to refilling Europe's storage units this summer, which are continuing at a nice clip," the consultancy's Director Europe Gas & LNG told DW.
Despite this, the bloc remains vulnerable to geopolitical shocks, not least those stemming from US President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Russia's energy tariffs create new uncertainty
 Trump is pressuring Brussels to put sanctions on buyers of Russian energy, arguing that it will pile additional financial strain on Moscow to end the three-and-a-half-year conflict.
Last week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the EU and the Group of 7 (G7) wealthy nations that they should join Washington in imposing "meaningful" tariffs on China and India over their energy deals with Moscow.
Trump has told Brussels that the US would "mirror" such tariffs, with a rate of 100% being considered.
Trump has already imposed 50% tariffs on India — 25% baseline plus 25% for striking a deal with Moscow in 2022 to buy discounted hydrocarbons. 
However, China — which has also ramped up purchases of Russian energy — holds a significantly stronger negotiating position with Washington over Trump's tariff threat. As a result, the US president has yet to outline plans for energy-related tariffs on the world's second-largest economy, while negotiations remain ongoing.

Ukraine gas transit deal had limited impact
The expiration of the Ukraine-Russia gas transit agreement on January 1 marked another layer of geopolitical pressure on Europe’s energy supply. Kyiv's decision not to renew the deal was also aimed at cutting off a revenue stream that helps fund Russia's war effort. 
The five-year agreement, which had allowed Russian gas to flow westward via Ukrainian pipelines, effectively closed one of the last major routes into the EU.
Initial fears of price spikes and supply disruptions were widespread, particularly in countries like Austria, Slovakia and Hungary, which had remained more reliant on Russian pipeline gas. Benchmark gas prices rose nearly 50% at points last year amid concerns about cold weather and reduced flows. 
Yet the actual market impact was muted. Western Europe had already diversified its energy sources, while underground storage levels remained strong heading into winter.
"The drop-off in volumes [via Ukraine] hasn't been huge, although some countries, particularly Slovakia, had to reorient some purchases," Tom Marzec-Manzer said. "Because it was well-anticipated, the end of the Ukraine gas transit deal didn't have a huge price or supply impact."


2 year target for energy independence from Russia
Having ridden the energy crisis, the EU is now in a stronger position to diversify the last of its supplies of Russian hydrocarbons. The bloc has already cut Russian gas imports from 45% to 19%, while Russian oil imports have shrunk from 27% at the start of the war to just 3% last year, according to the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm.
In May, the Commission published a detailed roadmap to completely ban all remaining imports of Russian gas and liquefied natural gas by 2027. The plan requires EU states to submit national plans for the phaseout of Russian gas by the end of the year, but this could still prove tricky for some.
"The Baltics have done an excellent job moving away from Russian fossil fuels, while Poland has largely phased out Russian gas," Katinas told DW. He said progress has been "uneven" in other Visegrad countries due to a lack of diversification efforts and investment in renewables.

The EU's strong gas stocks and varied supply lines are bolstering the bloc's winter readiness, yet Trump's tariff moves and unpredictable weather cloud the horizon. Natural gas prices won’t likely climb to 2022's nearly €340/MWh ($400) extremes, but isolated shortages could spark temporary spikes.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The new Champions League season is here and with it new teams, new kick-off times and a new chance for the Bundesliga.

What do I need to know about this season's Champions League?
The new format of a 36-team league with eight matches continues this year, but perhaps the most exciting news comes about kickoff times.
The final will be held at 18:00 CET rather than 21:00, a first in the competition's modern history. UEFA hopes the move will make the final more family-friendly, improve local transport options for traveling supporters and, pivotally, also reach more eyeballs in key markets around the world. 
The Champions League group stage makes history by setting new distance records, as Europe's biggest tournament grows into the continent's furthest corners. This season, the easternmost (Kazakh team Kairat) and northernmost European teams (Norway's Arctic Circle-based Bodo/Glimt) will compete in the group stage. It's also the first time in 20 years that a Ukrainian team has not qualified for the group stage. Cypriot side Pafos and Belgian team Union Saint-Gilloise will debut in the tournament, and the tournament will see six teams from one nation, England, for the first time.
Speaking of the newly named and formatted league stage, there are some exciting games to look forward to. Bayern Munich host Chelsea in a rematch of the 2012 final on September 17. Newcastle United and new signing Nick Woltemade are dropped into the deep end as they face Barcelona. The Spanish side play defending champions Paris Saint-Germain on October 1, Liverpool and Florian Wirtz play Real Madrid on November 4, Arsenal host Bayern Munich on November 26 and Manchester City travel to the Spanish on December 10 to play Real Madrid, the most successful team in the competition.


Do the German teams have a chance?
From a German Bundesliga perspective, all eyes will naturally be on Bayern Munich. They have three particularly tricky games during the league phase against Chelsea, Arsenal and defending champions Paris Saint-Germain. Otherwise, they should feel confident about finishing in the top eight and qualifying directly for the round of 16.
For head coach Vincent Kompany's team, the goal of winning the Champions League is ever-present. They currently might not be favorites, but after missing out on the final in Munich last season, Bayern will be hoping they can go better than the quarterfinals this time.
Borussia Dortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt might have a tougher time of finishing in the top eight as they face tougher opponents. Frankfurt though, have great recent history in European competition, memorably winning the Europa League just three years ago. This season, they have the makings of being a real surprise package, so they are worth keeping an eye on. Dortmund remain unpredictable, and it's unclear what to expect of Bayer Leverkusen after they changed coaches just two games into the Bundesliga season.
Freiburg and Stuttgart will hope to shine in the second-tier Europa League this season, while Mainz will aim to make the most of a possible home advantage by reaching the third-tier Conference League final on May 27, 2026, which will be played in Leipzig.


What are the key dates?
The group stage starts on September 16 and runs until January 28. The knockouts begin in the middle of February (17-18 and 24-25) and run with two games every month following that until the final on May 30 in Budapest. It's the first time a European Cup/Champions League final will be held in Hungary.
It's also worth noting that the 2026 World Cup will start just 12 days after the Champions League final. Questions about load management will likely resurface at the start of 2026 as players cycle through a particularly busy New Year schedule and face the prospect of the biggest World Cup ever (48 teams, 104 games) just five months later.
The Europa League Final is in Istanbul on May 20, 2026, and the women's Champions League final will be in Oslo on May 22, 2026.

Robert Redford, the Oscar-winning director, and actor, has died at the age of 89.
Redford died "at his home at Sundance in the mountains of Utah, the place he loved, surrounded by those he loved," his publicist Cindi Berger said.
He passed away in his sleep at his home in the mountains of Utah, according to his publicist Cindi Berger.
Redford rose to fame in films like "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "All the President's Men," using his star power to spotlight American culture and politics.
He later became a champion of independent cinema and was a vocal advocate for environmental causes.

Sundance Kid becomes indie champion
Born on August 18, 1936, in Santa Monica, California, Redford has always been independently minded. His fame and success never drove him from one Hollywood party to the next.


Redford focused on doing his own thing, by consciously choosing roles that had meaning for him, as well as the directors he worked with.
Initially written off as "just another California blond," Redford defied expectations with his rugged charisma and enduring appeal, becoming one of Hollywood's most bankable leading men and a beloved global icon for over 50 years.

Redford was one of the biggest stars of the 1970s with such films as "The Candidate," "All the President's Men" and "The Way We Were."
Redford capped off the decade with the best director Oscar for 1980's "Ordinary People," which also won best picture that same year.
His roles ranged from Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward, a mountain man in "Jeremiah Johnson," and a double agent in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
He used the money from his acting to co-found the Sundance Institute for aspiring independent filmmakers, from which the renowned annual film festival gets its name.   
"The industry was pretty well controlled by the mainstream, which I was a part of. But I saw other stories out there that weren't having a chance to be told and I thought, 'Well, maybe I can commit my energies to giving those people a chance.' As I look back on it, I feel very good about that," Redford told the Associated Press in 2018.

Tributes to Redford pour in 
Actor Marlee Matlin was one of the first to pay tribute to Redford, stating that her Oscar-winning film "Coda" would never have received the attention it did without the Sundance festival.
"Our film, CODA, came to the attention of everyone because of Sundance. And Sundance happened because of Robert Redford. A genius has passed," she wrote on X. 

Meryl Streep, who starred with Redford in "Out of Africa," said in a statement, "One of the lions has passed. Rest in peace my lovely friend." 
Superman Director James Gunn said he grew up with Redford's movies. 
"He was THE movie star, and will be greatly missed," he wrote on Instagram.

A committed environmental activist, Redford also fought to preserve the natural landscape and resources of Utah, where he lived.
Former US President Barack Obama awarded Redford the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, saying he was admired not just for his acting, "but for having figured out what to do next."
"He has supported our National Parks and our natural resources as one of the foremost conservationists of our generation," Obama said at the time.

Although he never showed an interest in entering politics, he often espoused a liberal viewpoint.
In a 2017 interview, during the first presidency of Donald Trump, he told Esquire magazine that "politics is in a very dark place right now" and that Trump should "quit for our benefit."
Despite this, Trump on Tuesday said, "I thought he was great."
"Robert Redford had a series of years where there was nobody better," Trump told reporters as he left the White House after a journalist told him that Redford had died.
Redford leaves behind his wife, Sibylle Szaggars, and two daughters.

In cricket, Pakistan and India share a deep love and a deeper rivalry, but this week, the attention of both nations turns to a much simpler and shorter sporting event.
At the World Athletics Championships in Japan, men's javelin throwers Neeraj Chopra and Arshad Nadeem are expected to compete against each other for the first time since the 2024 Olympics in Paris.
On that occasion, Nadeem of Pakistan took gold, ahead of Chopra, his Indian rival, who settled for silver after having won gold at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
In 2025, Julian Weber of Germany has had the longest throw, at 91.51 meters, and while Chopra has reached over 90 meters, Nadeem's best was 86.40 in May. This, however, came at his only event since the Olympics but fans don't seem too concerned.
"He had [calf muscle] surgery in July, so he has not been able to compete as much as he wanted," Farid Khan, a Karachi-based sports fan, told DW.
"We are not worried about his form because as long as he is fit, he can always produce one or two big throws out of six."


Popularity
The two athletes are huge stars back home partly because both countries have been starved of Olympic success. India may have 1.4 billion people, but Chopra's triumph was only its third gold medal since 1964. Nadeem's gold was Pakistan's first in 40 years and when his plane landed back in Lahore from Paris, there were thousands waiting to greet their new sporting hero. Chopra has been the face of international brands such as Samsung, Visa and Coca-Cola.
"We had never had much success in athletics, so Neeraj's gold was big," Sumit Pandey, a sports fan from Mumbai, told DW.
"He is a well-spoken guy and a decent looking man too; he has become one of the biggest sporting icons."
In Pakistan, Nadeem is similarly popular.
"We had watched Olympics after Olympics and seen other countries win gold after gold," said Khan.
"Then we had our hero, and something to celebrate. It is hard to explain how big it was."
'Not only friends, but brothers'
The fact that the two most recent Olympic champions are neighbors gives their relationship an extra edge.
"One hundred percent that Neeraj's rival comes from Pakistan makes it all feel bigger," said Pandey.

There seemed to be a shared South Asian pride after the 2024 Olympics. Chopra's mother Saroj Devi told Indian news  agency ANI that she was proud even though Nadeem won.
"We are very happy with the silver, the one who got gold is also our child and the one who got silver is also our child," she said. 
Nadeem's mother echoed those sentiments.
""They are not only friends but brothers," Razia Parveen told Islamabad newspaper Independent Urdu.
"Neeraj is also like our son and I pray for him that he wins medals. Winning and losing is part of sport but they are like brothers."
In December, Nadeem wished his rival a happy birthday in a warm message on social media.
"The comments from the mothers is the good part of it," said Pandey. "There are other times especially when India and Pakistan are going through difficult times, when it is not so good."
"Not so good" may be something of an understatement, given that the two countries have taken up arms against each other several times since their partition as they gained independence from Britain in 1947.

Invitation canceled
Earlier this year, the Indian athlete had invited his Pakistani rival to compete in the Neeraj Chopra Classic, an event held in July in Bengaluru. In April however, 26 people, mostly Indian tourists, were killed by terrorists in Pahalgam in India-administered Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan for the attack and the two sides exchanged fire.
Chopra subsequently cancelled the invitation
"After all that has taken place over the last 48 hours, Arshad's presence at the NC Classic was completely out of the question," he wrote on social media.
"Along with the entire nation, I am both hurt and angry at what has taken place."
He also criticized social media users over their attacks on his mother's comments about Nadeem.
"When my mother – in her simplicity – had made an innocent comment a year ago, there was an outpouring of praise for her views. Today,the same people haven't held back from targeting her for that very same statement."

Tokyo is the first time the two are to meet since that attack and any signs of tensions between them will be discussed at length.
"Relations between our countries are not good, that is just the reality," said Khan.
"I don't expect there to be any issues between them, however. They are professional athletes, will be focused on the event and there is a mutual respect."
Lasting legacy
Of course, it is not just about the two South Asian stars in Tokyo.
"Julian Weber is in very good form and will surely want to win gold," Ali Ahsan, a Pakistani sportswriter, told DW.
"Anderson Peters of Grenada and Keshorn Walcott of Trindad and Tobago also would want a medal finish. So the competition for medals will always be tough."
Win or lose, however. Their legacies are already secure.
"Neeraj showed for the first time that there is a possibility for Indians to win a medal at the highest stage for track and field. He has galvanized other Indian athletes and given them confidence that they can compete” said Pandey. "Because of Neeraj, there will be more.”
It is the same in Pakistan.
"Arshad has been an inspiration to us all," said Khan. "Whatever happens, he will go down in history, but it will be great if he wins gold in Tokyo."
Update: September 18, 2025. Both Neeraj Chopra and Arshad Nadeem turned in disappointing performances at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, with Chopra finishing 8th and Nadeem coming in 10th place. Keshorn Walcott of Trinidad and Tobago won gold, Anderson Peters of Grenada took silver and American Curtis Thompson won the bronze medal. Germany's Julian Weber had to settle for fifth place.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[在今年夏天，海洋公园已经命悬一线。7月中旬，海南富力海洋欢乐世界开发有限公司（下称“开发公司”）被合作方申请破产重整，项目已身陷诸多诉讼纠纷，负债累累；湖北小梅沙文化旅游发展有限公司的国企大股东披露了拟转让51％股权的意向，该项目今年上半年净亏损约900万元。
 
曾经是城市旅游“流量密码”的海洋公园，何以至此？

明星项目身陷困境
 
仅9万元的技术服务费，竟被海南富力海洋欢乐世界拖欠了三四年。海南一家环境科技公司的业务负责人告诉《中国新闻周刊》，公司在三四年前为海南富力海洋欢乐世界提供水土保持的技术服务，但对方从首付款开始便一直拖欠。
 
2010年，海南富力海洋欢乐世界项目计划落地海南省陵水黎族自治县黎安镇，它既是富力集团进军文旅产业的标志，也是改变黎安镇3个村庄命运的转折点。当时大概没有人想到，15年后，这个明星项目将债务缠身，身陷困境。
 
据全国企业破产重整案件信息网信息，7月15日，海南省第一中级人民法院审理通过，开发公司被合作方广州威能机电有限公司申请破产重整。
 
开发公司已无力偿付欠款。一批在去年10月审结的、开发公司与其他合作方的合同纠纷执行实施执行裁定书显示，合作方申请强制执行，法院查证了开发公司名下的财产，也前往陵水黎族自治县不动产登记中心调查，均未发现其有可供执行的财产。
 
六七年前，海南南洋水务工程有限公司开始为海南富力海洋欢乐世界提供污水处理设施，游泳池、水景池设备及安装服务。一位业务负责人告诉《中国新闻周刊》，公司总计被欠款近400万元，对方给出的解决方案是将欠款打7折，折算成公司旗下房产。“从未想过会差那么多钱。如果换成房子，卖出去估计还得再打7折。”他感叹。
 
关于被申请破产重整，富力集团副总经理兼海南海洋欢乐世界董事长刘小鸥此前对媒体回应，这是前期开发遗留问题，正在和政府一起积极化解。
 
资料显示，海南富力海洋欢乐世界是海南省重点规划项目，总投资约150亿元，一期投资约65亿元，规划占地2000亩，分为5大园区、9大场馆、5家酒店。一期项目原计划2013年开业，但在2019年才启动试营业，2021年才全面开业，一度引发争议。而在2021年开业后，该项目不仅要直面疫情的影响，还迎来了更多竞争对手，如海花岛海洋乐园、海棠湾亚特兰蒂斯、三亚海昌梦幻不夜城等。
 
中国主题公园研究院院长林焕杰告诉《中国新闻周刊》，早年间，房企与地方政府存在一种合作模式：房企承诺投资地方政府规划的项目，以换取低价拿地、政策优惠等支持。海洋公园是典型的“敲门砖”之一。
 
“这理论上是双赢，主题公园往往规划在城市边缘，房企拿地开发后能带动区域价值，也利于房地产项目。但如果开发方只是为了拿地，并不用心、专业地投入公园的建设与运营，项目也难具备市场竞争力。”他说。
 
快速扩张的后遗症
 
伴随房地产行业近20年的高速发展，国内水族馆行业也经历了一段快速扩张、技术粗放的时期。
 
随着投资规模的增加，“水族馆”的名称转变为海底世界、海洋馆、极地海洋世界、海洋公园等。总量上，2005年仅有80家，2013年增长到100家，截至2021年已有约260家。“8年间，每年开业20家，在全世界没有先例。”亚洲水族馆技术研究院联合创始人师哲告诉《中国新闻周刊》。据他统计，目前国内约有300家水族馆；除去微型水族馆，仅统计有引进保护动物并在政府备案的，则约230家。除了个别有国企背景，九成以上由私人运营。
 
“增速过快导致同质化严重，行业整体质量不仅没有提升，还有所下滑。”师哲指出。首先是催生了很多无设计、运营经验或资金投入的“三无水族馆”，超四成的市级地产水族馆可以归纳为这一类型。理论上，水族馆的设计、建设需要3—5年的周期，许多生物要提前半年至一年预订，鱼类等生物需要40天以上的检疫周期。
 
师哲提到，地产背景的投资方往往追求“多快好省”，重视短期投资效益，要求快速回笼资金。因而，相比于通过提升维生系统、饲养技术以降低生物损耗的具有较高展示质量的水族馆，三无水族馆更习惯将海洋生物视作消耗品。
 
“在开业前通常购买大量廉价且少数几类鱼，例如黄金鲹、鳐鱼、银鼓鱼、燕鱼等，在节假日期间不出现大量死亡就算成功，生物的完全损耗时间基本不超过半年。由于养不活，鱼的种类就逐步降级，数量逐渐减少。”他说。经测算，三无水族馆的开业生物损耗率在50％以上，稳定后，生物年损耗率在30％以上。相较之下，国内第一、第二梯队的水族馆能分别保持2％以内、5％以内的生物年损耗率。
 
大型海洋动物的养护更为不易。例如，2023年5月，湖北荆州小梅沙海洋馆内一只雌性白鲸“苏菲”被曝死亡，寿命为30岁，而白鲸的寿命通常在40—60岁。
 
其次，与地产关联性强的水族馆也更习惯在地产体系里寻找设计和施工方。“大部分预算变成了钢筋混凝土，追求场馆外立面的‘高大上’。但对于水族馆而言，更考验专业性的是后场设计与施工，不同海洋生物的过滤系统、生态系统、策展方式等，都涉及复杂的工程计算和生物知识。”师哲说。
 
同质化严重的背后，是专业人才缺乏，行业技术断代的现实。他表示，在1990—2005年中外合资发展旅游业时期成立的水族馆，不少馆长是“专业人员”，自身精通养殖技术。行业高速扩张后，集团下派、投资方背景的经理加入，与馆长争夺管理权，也逐渐导致技术断代。
 
不能“拉闸”的公园
 
当水族馆自身经营情况不景气，资产长期亏损，逐渐从地产公司的“敲门砖”，沦为被甩掉的“包袱”。
 
7月21日，国企深圳特发集团在深圳联合产权交易所披露了对湖北小梅沙文化旅游发展有限公司51％股权的转让意向，后者为湖北荆州小梅沙海洋馆项目的运营主体。海洋馆是荆州海洋世界一期项目的重要组成部分，于2018年正式开业。据转让公告，湖北小梅沙文化旅游发展有限公司于2024年净亏损617.3万元，今年上半年净亏损892.7万元。
 
这种经营压力普遍存在，即便是中国最大的海洋主题公园运营商也不例外。海昌海洋公园（下称“海昌”）目前在国内自持并运营7家大中型海洋文旅项目。据其财报，2020年度，企业净亏损14.5亿元；2022—2024年间，企业分别净亏损13.96亿元、1.97亿元和7.40亿元；今年上半年，亏损仍在持续。截至去年底，集团的净负债比率约329.4％，2023年底这一数值为182.5％。不乐观的盈利能力和负债水平，使之持续面临财务风险。
 
“大投入、大运营、大产出”是水族馆运营的基本特点，这也削弱了其抗风险能力。
 
水族馆多采用重资产运营模式，一个大型项目的投资支出会对当年的财务报表产生较大影响。2018年，投资50亿元建成的上海海昌海洋公园正式开业。2020年，海昌又以13.3亿元竞得三亚市海棠湾林旺片区一地块的土地使用权，用于开发三亚不夜城项目；2021年，海昌再投资42亿元进军郑州，打造郑州海昌海洋公园度假区。2020年，其净负债比率升至228.0％。
 
海昌也在2021年开始割肉求生，将其位于武汉、成都、天津、青岛的四座主题公园出售给韩国私募基金MBK Partner，获得了65.3亿元的资金流入。
 
“遇到危机，迪士尼、环球影城等陆上公园可以拉掉电闸、给员工放假以节省成本。但对于海洋公园而言，即便一分钱收入都没有，也不能拉闸，尤其不能省去动物养殖、保育和训练的成本。”林焕杰解释。
 
一家中型水族馆的负责人对《中国新闻周刊》透露，其员工最多的部门是养殖部、餐饮食堂和动物部，均需40人以上；其次是工程部，有20人以上，单人薪资在4300—5500元/月。电费方面，以中型水族馆为例，若选择以重力沙滤为主的成熟过滤方式，年电费为100万—300万元；若选择砂缸过滤为主，则更加依赖设备耗能，年电费达200万—600万元。
 
饵料方面，中型水族馆的年支出达20万—80万元，大型海洋公园的年支出达200万—300万元。包括水电、饵料、人工成本，养一头海豚、白鲸和虎鲸的年支出分别为50万—70万元、70万—90万元和500万元。
 
海昌2024年年报称，其生物总保有量超过17万只，其中大型极地海洋动物有30余种、1000余只，包括企鹅、海豹、海狮、海豚，以及虎鲸、白鲸、伪虎鲸、鲸鲨等，累积繁育大型珍稀海洋动物超千只。
 
师哲表示，一家水族馆“没钱”之后，首先会削减人员数量、以更低廉的价格进行社招，继而影响场馆卫生、生物健康，降低维护质量、延缓设备的维修与升级，取消策展，影响游客体验，从而陷入恶性循环。
 
如何破局？
 
为了继续活下去，有的寻求“卖身”，有的仍不断寻找“白衣骑士”，寻求资本输血。
 
海昌的艰难转型，是国内水族馆困境的一个典型缩影。6月2日晚，海昌发布公告称，公司以每股0.45港元向祥源控股集团旗下企业发行51亿股新股，总代价22.95亿港元。交易完成后，祥源控股集团将间接持有海昌海洋公园38.6％股份。由于其认购价较当日收盘价折让46.4％，业内普遍评价这是一次“抄底”级的收购。
 
事实上，海昌更早就意识到了水族馆重资产投入模式的风险，2015年，公司开始提出轻资产模式，轻资产业务在2021年更名为OAAS（Operation As A Service）业务。具体看来，主要表现为与区域小型海洋馆合作，输出管理能力和品牌；与有实力的投资方、地方国资平台等合作，打造围绕海洋主题的大型项目；以海洋文化为核心，从乐园向酒店等其他出行场景延伸等等。
 
目前，正在推进中的北京、福州、宁波前湾新区的海昌海洋公园项目均采取了轻资产运营模式。以北京项目为例，预计总投资约42亿元，由通州城市建设运行集团有限公司负责土地获取和投资建设，海昌则负责运营管理。
 
IP运营业务是海昌转型的另一条路径。海昌与奥特曼等国际级IP合作，将IP商品化与主题公园、景区、生活方式酒店、商业物业等地面消费娱乐场景融合。财报指出，上海公园的奥特曼主题酒店2024年的入住率超过70％，“持续地引入优秀IP，将大大拓展公园板块的收入高度，并优化收入结构”。
 
为了降低长期运营维护成本，海昌海洋公园还推出仿生海洋生物产品，如上海公园火山鲨鱼馆展缸中的仿生鲸鲨，身长4.7米、重约350公斤。海昌海洋公园高级副总裁李珂晖曾表示，从长期看，仿生机器人在能耗、饵料、养护、人工、运输等方面成本远低于活体生物展示的运营成本。
 
消费端也有挑战，林焕杰指出，游客的消费越来越理性，“钱包收紧了”。
 
据海昌年报，2024年，海昌旗下公园的入园人次共计约1079万人，同比增长16％；公园运营板块的收入为16.85亿元，同比下滑约0.1％，这意味着人均消费金额的下降。
 
师哲指出，水族馆同质化严重的问题也表现在二次销售方面。他建议，参考国际成熟水族馆的经验，有一定基础的水族馆应重视发展二销业务，如围绕馆内动物的故事进行文创开发，与流量联动。“只要会设计，即使是围绕一种鱼类，例如金枪鱼，也可以扩大成一个展馆，设置剧场，而非只能是大型动物。”
 
综合看来，他认为，出现危机的项目仍是个例，行业仍有发展潜力。从市场密度看，美国人均200万人有一家水族馆，欧洲人均400万人有一家水族馆，在中国市场，以230家水族馆计，这一数据为600万—700万人，市场仍未饱和。
 
不过，海洋馆饲养鲸豚、鲨鱼等大型海洋生物，长期存在动物福利争议。中国海洋大学未来海洋学院院长李建平在接受媒体采访时曾表示，海洋馆养殖大型海洋动物还存在一些问题。“首先是打破了生态平衡和物种遗传多样性，导致基因瓶颈；其次，在人工环境，因空间不足和自然行为受限，大大影响其健康和寿命。”
 
但从长期看，行业竞争持续加剧，将倒逼创新与转型。“我们应清楚，发展旅游地产的时代已经过去了，‘做旅游是为了做地产’的产品将会死一大片。”CTDU中旅联董事长符奕斌告诉《中国新闻周刊》。未来，他更看好小而精的海洋旅游产品，例如跨界打造复合型消费场景，融合科技、演艺和IP创意的特色产品。
 
海洋公园的“明星”，早已不是虎鲸了，甚至也不是海洋生物。
 
前不久，上海海昌海洋公园庆祝了奥特曼主题馆开业3周年，近年来，园区内不仅有身高12米的赛罗奥特曼这一“金字招牌”，也用奥特曼演出、藏品和主题酒店吸引游客。打开香港海洋公园的官网，近几年宣传力度最大的是大熊猫家族，公园围绕熊猫推出了超400款限定周边。在大多数水族馆，美人鱼等NPC也不逊色于海洋动物表演，已成为游客打卡分享的首选。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[近日，殡葬业龙头福寿园发布2025年中期业绩。这家长期以高利润著称的公司，一度被外界称作“殡葬茅台”，却交出了自2013年港股上市以来的首份亏损报告。
 
公告显示，今年上半年，福寿园实现营收约6.11亿元，同比下降44.5%，净利润由盈转亏，亏损额达2.61亿元，这一反转令外界意外。
 
福寿园成立于1994年，是国内最早进入殡葬服务的民营企业之一。公司业务涵盖墓地销售、殡仪服务等，从上海起步，已扩展至全国40多个城市，主要面向中高端客户群体。
 
凭借特殊行业的壁垒，叠加老龄化趋势加剧，殡葬行业长期被认为是一门赚钱的生意，福寿园更是其中的“优等生”。2010年至2023年，公司营收从3.5亿元一路攀升到了26.28亿元，利润翻数倍，最高时利润达到近8亿元。
 
但另一面，“天价墓地”、居民购买商品房存放骨灰盒等现象在近年来屡屡引发争议。近年来，多地出台墓地限价、限制经营性墓地占地面积等政策，整个殡葬行业开始调整，主攻高端市场的福寿园首当其冲。

墓穴单价接近腰斩
 
在福寿园的收入结构中，约八成来自墓园服务，其余来自殡仪服务等业务。过去几年，福寿园的高端墓穴价格一路攀升，2018年至2023年，平均售价从10.25万元涨到了11.95万元，2024年进一步升至12.12万元。
 
但在2025年上半年业绩报告中，墓地业务成了亏损的主要原因。
 
截至2025年6月30日，福寿园墓园服务收入约4.77亿元，同比下滑47.35%，在总营收中的占比降至78%左右。经营性墓穴作为主要产品，上半年销售了6253个，仅比去年同期减少451个，但总收入却缩水了约4亿元，降幅达到51%，平均售价从12万元骤降至6.3万元，几乎腰斩。
 
福寿园在公告中解释称，公司为适应不同地区的经济环境、消费行为和竞争格局，不得不下调产品均价，通过调整高、中附加值产品供给结构，增加中价位产品类别，叠加墓穴销售服务增值税等多因素，拉低了整体销售均价。
 
作为大本营，上海市场的表现尤其明显：上半年墓园及殡仪服务收入仅2.4亿元，较去年同期下降54.2%。此外，河南、黑龙江等地跌幅也超过50%。
 
这背后，与地方政策有一定关系。因土地资源稀缺、经济发展水平高等，上海的墓地价格普遍高于许多城市。上海民政部门近年来积极推行墓穴小型化，倡导海葬、草坪葬、花坛葬、壁葬、室内葬等节地生态葬式，要求公墓丰富葬式品种、降低价格水平。今年2月，上海还发布《殡葬服务项目清单》，明确提出对价格进行规范和引导。
 
事实上，直到2023年，福寿园的墓地售价仍在持续上升。由于早期土地多为划拨，成本极低，上海福寿园原始土地收购价仅190元/平方米，直到2016年，福寿园公开的墓地毛利率超过80%。2024年，福寿园遭遇上市以来的首次利润“腰折”，归母净利润降至3.73亿元，同比下滑52.8%，为今年的亏损埋下伏笔。
 
除了高价墓地销售受阻外，2025年上半年，公司还确认了约2.18亿元的资产减值，涉及4个公墓项目的商誉和其他长期资产，也是造成业绩亏损的原因之一。福寿园高层在业绩会上解释，受宏观经济和增值税等影响，这些项目的运营效率和现金流预期在短期内未达原有评估水平，因此基于会计准则和谨慎性原则，计提了相应的减值准备。
 
先把骨灰寄存起来
 
值得注意的是，福寿园并非孤例。
 
2025年上半年，多家殡葬企业营收下滑甚至亏损。成立于2003年、总部位于南京的万桐园，同样面向中高端客户群体，2015年在港股上市。其半年报显示，上半年收益仅1106万元，同比下降54%，由盈利转为亏损。此外，安贤园、中国生命集团等公司也在半年报中提示殡葬收入承压。
 
周之远在西南地区一家福寿园做了10年墓园销售，过去两年，他明显感觉到客户变了。高消费仍在，但伴随经济转型，不少中产群体对买墓地的态度发生了转变：以前的客户都觉得，买墓地是必须的，并愿意承担高价，但如今不少人倾向于观望。
 
重庆一位殡葬从业者关万芬也有同感。他从2018年进入殡葬行业，近期注意到，在重庆，骨灰寄存量近年来在明显上升。过去客户都会选择“热葬”，客户会在逝者去世三天内办完丧事，其间一定会定下墓位，销售抓住这个心理，交易非常容易。但近两年他接触的不少客户，会选择先把骨灰寄存起来，一年寄存费用只需要不到300元，逝者安葬的周期被无限延长，销售员的快速成交路径失效。
 
新冠疫情在一定程度上成为行业分水岭。关万芬回忆，2020年之前，当地骨灰堂有8000个存放格位，却一直没满；2020年以后，新建了15000个格位，却依然供不应求。
 
此外，受访的销售普遍提到，近几年客户购买力下降。周之远在推荐高端墓位时，听到最多的回应是“钱不好挣，能办丧事就行了，不用追求太高档的墓地”。
 
相比之下，中低端市场受影响较小。受访墓地销售提到，低价客户的诉求很简单，只要便宜够用，比如壁墓只需3000元左右，一些生态葬价格更低，还能拿到政府补贴。
 
中高端墓位的需求并未消失，但政策调控给行业带来不确定性。近年来，殡葬行业监管不断收紧，各地纷纷开展殡葬领域专项整治行动，同时推广多种节地生态葬形式。
 
关万芬发现，高端客户对墓位未来的担忧明显增加。人们通常会把买墓穴和买房子作比较，但两者背后的购买逻辑并不相同。买房可以多地置业，但墓园涉及地段、环境、风水等因素，一旦选定，客户往往不愿再改变位置，这在高端客户中体现得尤其明显。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[中药企业里，提到济川药业，和同仁堂、片仔癀、云南白药这些耳熟能详的老字号相比，认知度或许差了不少。
 
但如果提到蒲地蓝消炎口服液和小儿豉翘清热颗粒这两个产品，有印象的消费者立刻就多了起来。尤其是孩爸孩妈，几乎无人不识这两大呼吸道领域的“国民级神药”。
 
卖得有多好？多年以来，蒲地蓝消炎口服液销售额都保持在20亿元以上，小儿豉翘清热颗粒也是10亿级别的大单品。
 
只不过近年来，两个“大单品”销量开始承压，连带着也影响到了济川药业的业绩。近日济川药业发布的2025年半年报显示，报告期内实现营业收入为27.5亿元，同比下降31.9%；归母净利润7.24亿元，同比下降45.9%。
 
对此，济川药业在半年报中给出的部分原因是：“公司蒲地蓝消炎口服液、小儿豉翘清热颗粒销售收入同比减少。”
 
“呼吸神药”，究竟怎么了？
 
两大单品，造就一个富豪家族
 
和许多动辄有几百年历史的中成药品种相比，济川药业的两大主力品种出现得都比较晚。
 
资料显示，蒲地蓝消炎口服液2003年获批上市，主要成分为蒲公英、板蓝根、苦地丁、黄芩，常被用于治疗感冒、咽炎、扁桃体炎等上呼吸道感染疾病。作为济川药业的独家剂型，其自上市以来，累计销售额已经超过百亿元。
 
小儿豉翘清热颗粒（同贝）则是2005年获批上市的产品，主要成分为连翘、淡豆豉、薄荷、荆芥、栀子、大黄、青蒿、赤芍、槟榔、厚朴、黄芩、半夏、柴胡、甘草等，主攻领域同样是呼吸道适应证，如小儿风热感冒等。
 
两大单品，是济川药业最为重要的营收支柱。早在2018年，蒲地蓝消炎口服液就拿下了32亿元营收，占当年济川药业总营收的40%以上。
 
据米内网数据，2024年，蒲地蓝消炎口服液在全国城市公立医院清热解毒用药中成药市场份额为13.6%，排名第二；在中国城市药店清热解毒用药中成药市场份额为7.54%，排名第二，仅次于扬子江药业的蓝岑口服液。
 
据行业媒体测算，小儿豉翘清热颗粒的累计销售额在去年突破了百亿大关。另据济川药业年报，小儿豉翘清热颗粒占2024年全国公立医院儿科感冒用中成药市场份额为46.55%，占中国城市药店儿科感冒用中成药市场37.32%的份额，均稳居第一。
 
有市场分析人士评价，这两大单品，都采用“直接搞定医生，间接搞定病人”的策略，即早年主攻院内渠道，医生推荐使用意愿强。等到占据了儿童家长等消费者心智后，药店等院外渠道也就不缺主动上门求购的消费者了。
 
在两大单品的助推下，济川药业在2013年借壳洪城股份成功登陆资本市场。上市第一年，公司实现营业收入24.47亿元，其中蒲地蓝消炎口服液的销售额就已经超过了10亿元，占比接近一半。

随着公司产品的大卖，公司创始人曹龙祥也顺势登上了胡润富豪榜。2024年胡润全球富豪榜显示，曹龙祥父子身家达到了225亿元，排名1132位。
 
市场竞争加剧
 
然而近两年，这两款药的销量相继出现了下滑，导致济川药业的业绩连续承压，继去年营收利润双降之后，今年上半年降幅又进一步扩大。
 
对此，济川药业在半年报中给出的部分原因是“受终端市场需求变化”。
 
湖南省药品流通行业协会原秘书长黄修祥告诉中国新闻周刊，“终端市场需求变化”或许指的是前些年的超高基数。
 
2021年到2023年，全国性的呼吸道疾病反复来袭，济川药业接住了需求，实现了业绩爆发。其间营业收入从76.3亿元增至96.55亿元，归母净利润从17.19亿元增至28.23亿元。高基数难以维持，近两年自然有所回落。
 
不过拉长时间维度，其实早在2019年，济川药业就出现了上市六年来首次营收净利双降局面，直到2021年才短暂遏制住了继续向下的趋势。
 
究其原因，还是市场竞争压力过大导致的。
 
虽然蒲地蓝消炎口服液一直是独家品种，但“蒲地蓝”这个大类却有许多竞争者。中国新闻周刊检索国家药监局官网发现，包含“蒲地蓝”关键字的结果共有30余条，剂型多为消炎片剂，生产商中不乏达仁堂、健民药业、云南白药等大企业。
 
中国新闻周刊走访线下药店发现，各品牌蒲地蓝消炎片的价格相对较低，仁和药业、华润三九的产品标价均在30元以下，且是药店工作人员首推的产品。只有在被问及“有没有口服液”时，工作人员才指出济川药业的产品，还特意提醒“价格比较贵”，约46元一盒。
 
并且在“清热解毒”这个领域中，也不光有蒲地蓝类制剂，除前述扬子江药业的蓝岑口服液外，还有板蓝根、黄连上清片、牛黄解毒片、银翘解毒片等，这些都会分流走济川药业的部分市场。
 
与上述中成药横向对比，蒲地蓝消炎口服液的价格也偏高。按10支装价格46元、日用3支计算，其日用药成本高达13.8元。相比之下，各品牌的20袋装板蓝根颗粒价格平均不到15元，按日用3袋计算，日用药成本还不到3元。
 
此外，早在2021年，蒲地蓝消炎口服液就已经陆续被多地省级医保目录清退。据不完全统计，蒲地蓝消炎口服液已被调出河北、安徽、山东、黑龙江、江苏、湖南等多地医保目录，并且至今仍未纳入国家医保。
 
黄修祥对此解释道，自2019年国家医保目录调整以来，由于缺乏严格的循证医学证据，价格相比同适应证化药更高等因素，中成药被调出医保的现象较为普遍。
 
中国新闻周刊梳理发现，除了蒲地蓝消炎口服液，小儿感冒宁糖浆、柴黄清热颗粒等产品也相继被多地医保调出。
 
这在客观上，意味着患者需自费购买产品，从而在一定程度上影响购买意愿。
 
济川药业的另一大品种也没能“幸免”。
 
去年，上海市医药集中招标采购事务管理所公布了一批重点监控药品幅度靠前且有一定采购金额的品种，其中小儿豉翘清热颗粒赫然在列。有分析人士认为，若被列入监控名单，医疗机构可能因价格审查或替代品选择而减少采购，导致销量短期下滑。
 
当合计收入占比超过六成的两款药品都出现下滑，济川药业想保住增长也就不太现实了。
 
创新效果还需观察
 
当原有的两大支柱先后进入增长瓶颈后，济川药业坐不住了。
 
2019年前后，济川药业围绕“蒲地蓝”打造了产品相当丰富的矩阵，其中包括牙膏、抑菌含漱液、抑菌口喷、抑菌口腔膏、抑菌喷剂、抑菌洗手液等。
 
中成药企业跨界日化和药妆并不鲜见，近年来片仔癀、白云山等企业都有类似动作，不过多年来，只有云南白药在这条路上取得了较好的成绩。2023年，济川药业年报显示其日化品业务取得了8900余万销售收入，2024年该项目未在财报中单独列示。

其二是进行剂型改良。
 
济川药业在年报中提及，由于小儿豉翘清热颗粒口感欠佳，为提高儿童用药依从性，公司决定对该药剂型进行改良，并于2023年11月取得国家药品监督管理局核准签发的小儿豉翘清热糖浆（金同贝）《药品注册证书》。该药是新版《药品注册管理办法》实施以来首个上市的中药改良型新药，满足了儿童差异化的用药需求。
 
不过对于这一动作能带来多大的业绩提振，黄修祥颇为担心。他指出，糖浆新品的出现不一定能拿下太多新市场，却有可能替代掉颗粒剂型的部分销量，“分流销量大概在5%—10%”。
 
想象空间真正比较大的策略，还是往创新药方向的转型。
 
今年7月，国家药监局官网信息显示，由济川药业与征祥医药战略合作的抗流感1类创新药济可舒（玛硒洛沙韦片）获批上市。
 
该合作成果与济川药业近年来践行的创新药战略有关。商务拓展（BD）方面，济川药业2022年前后开始引进创新药，当年的股权激励中还出现了“一年BD至少4个产品”的描述。
 
济川的BD动作不局限于儿科、呼吸等与原本业务契合的赛道，除与征祥医药的合作外，还包括与天境生物合作的长效生长激素，与恒翼生物合作的PDE-4抑制剂（适应证为中重度斑块型银屑病和轻中度特应性皮炎）、蛋白酶抑制剂（用于改善选择性肠切除术患者肠道功能的恢复、减少术后肠梗阻）等。
 
自研方面，目前济川药业有两个中药1.1类项目已进入临床三期阶段，其中一款为小儿便通颗粒，另一款仍属于济川药业的传统优势领域，主治急性上呼吸道感染（风热感冒）引起的发热、头痛、咽痛、四肢酸痛症状。
 
然而值得注意的是，济川药业的创新管线布局中，许多都是原本就竞争激烈的领域，能否突出重围，仍未可知。
 
例如刚上市的济可舒，竞争对手有罗氏的奥司他韦（达菲）和玛巴洛沙韦片（速福达），以及东阳光药的磷酸奥司他韦颗粒（可威）等，面对这些“元老”，济川药业的渠道和品牌优势似乎都不明显。
 
去年年底，济川药业与天境生物合作的长效重组人生长激素已申请上市，这一赛道竞争亦颇为激烈，龙头地位长期被长春高新旗下的金赛药业所把持。此外今年5月，特宝生物的长效生长激素（益佩生）获批上市，维昇药业的隆培促生长素已完成三期临床，上市许可申请已于去年获国家药监局受理，预计也将在今年获准上市。
 
黄修祥建议，对于济川药业这种规模的大型药企，转型动作可以是多元化的，不必囿于某个特定方向，“在进一步发力拓展产品矩阵和多元化产品管线之外，还可以考虑同步进行国际化与品牌升级工作，迎合当下中成药出海的大趋势，进一步开拓海外市场”。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[业绩向上，股价却急转直下。最近，顺丰股价跌得就是如此猝不及防。
 
时间拉回到8月28日晚间，顺丰公布半年报，营收同比增长9.26%至1468.58 亿元，归母净利润同比增长19.37%至57.38亿元。
 
不过，在业内遥遥领先的营收规模、与行业平均水平相当的增速以及还不错的盈利增长，并没能带动市场信心。
 
次日开盘，顺丰股价快速跳水，且下跌之势持续至9月12日收盘。过去的11个交易日中，其累计跌幅近14%，市值已蒸发超300亿元。
 
这不禁令人好奇，顺丰到底怎么了？

激励有错？
 
在中央财经大学副教授刘春生看来，顺丰近期公布的“共同成长”持股计划（A股），是投资者近期关注重点之一。
 
这是一次长期激励安排。顺丰公告显示，该计划的股票来自其控股股东明德控股的无偿捐赠，总数不超过2亿股，总价值近百亿元，激励对象覆盖董事、监事、公司高管及核心骨干员工（包括收派员、运作员等基层员工）等，锁定期长达十年。
 
考虑到顺丰董事长王卫持有明德控股99.9%的股权，这相当于王卫自己要拿出真金白银来赠予员工。
 
这听起来是个对公司长期发展有利的事儿，但市场的解读却有争议。
 
一个不小的争议在于，顺丰“共同成长”持股计划设置的行权条件过于宽松。
 
根据公告，该计划在公司层面的业绩考核目标是年度净利润增长率为正。在不少投资者看来，这意味着极低的门槛。
 
“员工本就无须出资，业绩考核门槛极低，（这一计划）被质疑为‘福利’而非激励，可能滋生‘躺赢’心态，难以真正激发员工积极性。”中国企业资本联盟副理事长柏文喜对中国新闻周刊表示。
 
同时，该计划可能给股东的利益带来一定冲击。
 
一方面，该计划或无法避免侵蚀顺丰的利润。柏文喜指出，根据股份支付会计准则，无偿赠与的股份需按公允价值在等待期内计入相关成本或费用；今年顺丰计划首次授予虚拟股份单元8114.4万份，预计未来11年的总摊销费用约4.25亿元；随着激励股份全部完成发放，其面临的累计摊销费用可能高达数十亿元。
 
另一方面，该计划可能对顺丰未来的股价带来较大影响。刘春生解释，这种担忧缘于待十年锁定期一过，员工手中的股票解禁，可能导致大量低价股票入市冲击股价。
 
如是种种可能对股东利益的潜在稀释，也就引发了投资者的担心。
 
业绩质量待观察
 
不过，综合多位行业分析人士观点，更深层的原因，还要在顺丰的业绩中寻找。
 
一方面，行业普遍的价格战困局，顺丰也无法幸免。
 
宏观来看，快递市场量增价跌的现象已成常态。国家邮政局数据显示，今年上半年，国内快递业务量累计完成956.4亿件，同比增长19.3%，快递业务收入累计完成7187.8亿元，同比增长10.1%；由此计算，单票平均收入为7.5元，较去年同期下降7.7%。如果将时间拉得更长，当前的票均价格已不足2007年（平均单票价格28.6元）的零头。
 
顺丰的单票收入也在持续下降。据其披露，今年7月，其单票收入为13.55元，相比于去年同期的15.76元下降14.02%。而在2018年，顺丰的票均收入为23.18元。
 
虽然降价为顺丰换得了市场份额的提升——行业数据显示，其今年上半年市占率较去年提升0.6%至8.2%，中通、韵达、申通等则有小幅下降，但在柏文喜看来，这种增收不增利，可能导致投资者对其可持续性存疑。
 
另一方面，顺丰速运物流业务之外的部分还没能真正支棱起来。
 
尤其是供应链及国际业务，虽然今年上半年为顺丰贡献342.34亿元营收，占比提升至23.31%，半年亏损约2.96亿元，但是剔除KEX亏损、并购KLN融资利息等因素，该业务净利润同比增长178%。
 
外部环境的变化也为其雪上加霜。柏文喜认为，美国取消800美元以下进口包裹免税政策，直接推高了跨境物流成本，这也引发了市场对其海外业务布局的担忧。
 
而这些因素也导致顺丰的盈利质量并不尽如人意。
 
“虽然归母净利润同比增长19.37%，但扣非净利润增速只有 9.72%，到了二季度更是只有3.46%，远低于市场预期。”柏文喜分析说，这显示其核心业务的盈利能力在下滑。
 
刘春生进一步指出，顺丰核心利润在一定程度上依赖子公司处置，主业盈利质量并没有看起来那么强。顺丰半年报显示，其来自处置子公司的投资收益为7.78亿元，这也为其拉高了当期利润。
 
顺丰盈利能力承压，从毛利率的变化上亦可见一斑。今年上半年，顺丰的毛利率较去年同期下降0.6%至13.22%，第二季度单季更是同比下降1.4个百分点。
 
虽然在当下行业“反内卷”的政策引导之下，顺丰有望提升单票价格，从价格战压力中得到部分解放，但柏文喜指出：“若行业涨价导致电商客户成本上升，可能引发短期业务量波动，顺丰需平衡价格与量的关系；同时，中通、圆通等对手仍具成本优势，若‘反内卷’执行不到位，价格战可能反复。”从这一点来看，顺丰单票价格回升空间或许有限。
 
如此形势，难免令投资者担忧。
 
归根结底，投资者在意的不只是顺丰当下的增长数字，更是对未来增长质量的疑虑。
 
因而在刘春生看来，顺丰想要重新获得市场信心，关键在于提升时效快递等核心业务的盈利能力，加快供应链、国际业务调整以改善亏损，强化同城业务优势。
 
“反之，若价格战持续，顺丰的市值需要进一步观察。”柏文喜判断。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[At pro-Palestinian demonstrations, the symbol of the watermelon is everywhere. Artist Sliman Mansour explains how the idea for the symbol goes back to the 1980s and was inspired, ironically, by an Israeli officer.

Watermelons are grown throughout the Middle East, and they're a staple of Palestinian cuisine. They owe their political significance to their colors; with their green-and-white rind, red flesh and black seeds, they recall the colors of the Palestinian flag. 

'Why don't you paint flowers?'
"We were not allowed to paint in red, green, black and white: The Palestinian flag was forbidden. And the colors of the Palestinian flag were forbidden," recalled Palestinian artist Sliman Mansour in a 2021 interview with Al Jazeera, referring to Israeli policy in the occupied Palestinian territories during the 1980s.
'We were not allowed to paint in red, green, black and white: The Palestinian flag was forbidden,' said Palestinian artist Suleiman (Sliman) MansourImage: DW/S. Hofmann

After some paintings were confiscated from Mansour's gallery in Ramallah, he and a group of artists met with an Israeli officer, who delivered the order that exhibitions first needed to be approved by the Israeli censorship office before being shown in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. 
"He was trying to convince us not to do any political art, saying, 'Why don't you paint nice flowers or a nude figure? … I will even buy from you.'"
"If I paint a flower with these colors, what will you do?" asked one artist. "Even if you paint a watermelon, it will be confiscated," the officer replied.
And that was how, according to Mansour, the watermelon idea actually came from an Israeli soldier. 
Fruit becomes a statement
In the Palestinian territories, the watermelon took on a life of its own. It appeared on walls, T-shirts, posters and in art galleries.


"This drawing is from [a] Palestinian children's folklore stories book, and it talks about the story of a mythical toddler who gets out of a watermelon and can speak and act as an adult," Mansour wrote on Instagram in October 2023. "It seems that this is not a myth; the children of Gaza are being forced into being adults, adults who are living through hell." 


Palestinian flag dates back to 1916
According to the Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs, the Palestinian flag was designed by Sharif Hussein bin Ali, emir of Mecca, in 1916. At the time, the area known as the Palestinian territories was part of the Ottoman Empire, and the flag became a symbol of the Arab revolt against the Turks.
Hussein dreamed of an independent Arab kingdom — stretching across today's Palestinian territories and into Syria, Israel, Jordan and Lebanon.

The Turks were defeated with British help, but the dream of a unified Arab kingdom never materialized. Until 1948, Palestine remained under British mandate. After the British withdrew, the flag of the Arab revolt was revived as the national flag of the Palestinian state.
Less than 20 years later, however, it was banned once more. After the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The flag was outlawed; even posters and old photos showing it were forbidden. Those who raised it risked arrest.

The ban was only lifted again in 1993. During the Oslo peace process, Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization agreed to coexist peacefully, and recognized each other. The flag was accepted as the symbol of the Palestinian Authority, which was set up to govern Gaza and the West Bank.
In January 2023 — nine months before Hamas attacked Israel — Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir instructed police to remove Palestinian flags from public spaces.
"I ordered the removal of flags supporting terrorism from the public space and to stop the incitement against Israel," said the far-right politician. The move effectively reinstated the ban.

Popular on social media
Today, protesters around the world are using the watermelon as a political statement at pro-Palestinian demonstrations. After Israel's invasion of Gaza following the Hamas attack, use of the symbol also grew on social media. To avoid having posts deleted, many users replaced the Palestinian flag with the watermelon emoji.
Artist Khaled Hourani has been painting watermelons for years. On Instagram, he posted one against a golden background; the artwork was auctioned off to benefit a UK-based foundation supporting health care for Palestinians.


A racist stereotype in the US
But the history of the watermelon as a symbol is all but straightforward.
In the United States, long before it became a widespread Palestinian symbol through social media, the fruit has had racist connotations. As the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia documents, white Americans have used it to mock Black people.
After the abolition of slavery in 1865, many freed Black people earned a living growing and selling watermelons. The fruit grows quickly, requires little labor and is easy to cultivate. White racists twisted those aspects in an attempt to stereotype Black people as lazy.
Caricature images were disseminated depicting Black people with outlandish red lips, biting greedily into melons with juice running down their faces, to imply they were childish and unclean. Such imagery circulated widely in the southern US, with the aim of insulting and demeaning the Black community.
That history resurfaced a year ago, when the Democratic Socialists of America used the image of a watermelon in fliers calling on Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to show solidarity with Gaza. But in this case the two different symbolic meanings of the watermelon collided, as it targeted an African American politician, and the flier triggered controversy.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Donald Trump has made billions from the Nasdaq debut of crypto startup World Liberty Financial. With his sons in charge and favorable policies in play, critics see a troubling mix of presidential power and personal gain.

US President Donald Trump and his family are pocketing billions from cryptocurrency ventures since his return to the White House, capitalizing on a loosely regulated market he has actively shaped.
From meme coins to stablecoins, digital currencies designed to stay at a fixed value, the financial windfall is estimated at over $5 billion (€4.25 billion) on paper, sparking accusations of unprecedented profiteering by a sitting president.
Two companies drive the Trump family's crypto profits: World Liberty Financial (WLF), a decentralized finance platform that lets users with $WLFI tokens help shape the platform’s lending rules, and American Bitcoin Corp. (ABTC), a Nasdaq-listed bitcoin mining company.
WLF has earned millions from $WLFI token sales tied to Trump’s name, while ABTC, backed by his sons, holds significant bitcoin assets and saw its stock jump 110% on its debut, before settling 16.5% higher than the opening price of $6.90.
Reuters news agency reported that a Trump business entity owns 60% of WLF and is entitled to 75% of revenue from coin sales.


Concerns over influence and access
Critics believe the Republican president’s dual role as crypto beneficiary and policymaker undermines public trust and blurs the line between governance and self-enrichment.
Ross Delston, an independent American attorney and expert witness, thinks the crypto ventures could offer unscrupulous actors the chance to buy influence with Trump just by investing in his digital coins.
"This is a new avenue to allow the President to get money from anyone, including foreign individuals and states that would be prohibited by US [election] campaign laws, or someone convicted of a crime or under investigation," Delston told DW. 
Although Trump and his sons are barred from selling their own tokens in WLF for now, they are almost certain to profit big in the medium term. The White House insists, however, that there are no conflicts of interest.

How Trump has changed on crypto
Trump's favorable policies toward crypto after his return to office have come as a surprise to some after he called digital currencies like bitcoin a "scam" and a threat to the dollar during his first term. Now he wants to make the United States the crypto capital of the world.
Before returning to the White House, Trump nominated longtime crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US financial markets regulator. He was confirmed in the position in April.
One of Trump's first Executive Orders, signed in January, banned any US agency from creating or promoting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), a government-issued crypto version of the dollar.
In March, he established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, funded by cryptocurrencies seized by US authorities, and a Digital Asset Stockpile of other currencies. These assets are now treated as national reserves.
This summer, Trump signed the Genius Act, the first federal framework for stablecoins.


Lavish dinners and political perks
The embrace of crypto has extended beyond policy into high-profile social events, most notably the White House-hosted dinners for digital asset moguls. These gatherings, often featuring lavish menus and exclusive access to the president, have drawn scrutiny for blending political power with private financial interests.
One standout event was the May 2025 Crypto Kings dinner at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where the top holders of Trump’s meme coin, $TRUMP, were invited after collectively spending $148 million. 
The top 25 investors received private access to the president, while the four largest holders were gifted luxury Trump Tourbillon watches. Justin Sun, a China-born crypto billionaire and adviser to World Liberty Financial, was the top guest, spending $18.5 million.
Critics argue that such events serve less as forums for innovation and more as showcases for influence-peddling, where proximity to the presidency appears to be a perk of investment.
"This is maybe just one more step that this administration has taken of combining public office with private gain," Richard Briffault, a professor at Columbia Law School, told DW. "This includes making regulatory decisions, but also using the prestige of the White House and the presidency to advance the Trump family's fortunes."

How US regulators are handling crypto
US federal regulators have taken a markedly hands-off approach to crypto oversight, largely due to a sweeping executive order issued in January that dismantled many of the Biden-era guardrails and replaced them with a framework designed to promote innovation and accelerate adoption of cryptocurrencies.
Washington has removed some confusing rules about how crypto companies should report their finances, which made it hard for businesses to show crypto assets on their balance sheets or work with banks. By rolling them back, the administration is making it easier for crypto firms to operate and grow.
Before, the SEC was very strict, especially under its former leader, Gary Gensler. It launched many investigations and lawsuits against crypto firms. Those actions have mostly stopped under Trump 2.0.
While Biden’s approach was more about caution and control, Trump's was described by one industry insider as "crypto capitalism on steroids." While the crypto sector is now booming, the latest US policies are raising serious questions about ethics, transparency, and long-term stability.

Purge of officials sparks alarm
Concerns over political loyalty within federal agencies have also intensified, with critics pointing to a growing pattern of dismissals targeting career officials seen as out of sync with the Trump administration’s agenda.
They include Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, CDC Director Susan Monarez, railroad regulator Robert Primus and, most notably, Erika McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"The administration has had no compunctions about firing people, including ordinary civil servants who are just doing their jobs, if they are politically out of step with the administration," said Briffault. "There's no greater signal than the firing of the head of the Bureau of Labour Statistics. If they're willing to do that, they're willing to fire anybody."
This climate of fear and retaliation has made regulators increasingly cautious about challenging Trump’s crypto ventures, even when ethical concerns arise.
US lawmakers are now pushing Congress to bring back stronger oversight and tighten control over the latest crypto policies. They're calling for clearer rules on digital currencies, more transparency from companies like WLF, and limits on officials who hold crypto themselves. Critics warn the current setup benefits insiders and puts everyday users at risk.
"The most likely outcome is a huge increase in criminal prosecutions, regulatory enforcement actions, as well as economic dislocation following in the wake of this presidency," warned Delston.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[When the African Space Agency opened in April, spacefaring countries like Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa came together for the first time. But they have been collaborating with Europe and China for decades.
    For space scientist Temidayo Oniosun, 'space is nothing new in Africa' Image: Zoonar/picture alliance   
For Temidayo Oniosun, the story is the same as it ever was: "Space is nothing new in Africa." But the dimensions have changed, said the space scientist and founder of Space in Africa , a think tank in Lagos, Nigeria.
During the early space race in the 1960s, African countries played an important role in the Apollo moon missions, Oniosun told DW. They hosted critical infrastructure, without which, "the missions wouldn't have been possible."
"But nobody talked about that," Oniosun said. "When America sent [NASA astronaut] Neil Armstrong to the moon, it wasn't like, 'This is good for America, and we thank Africa and other regions for their contribution.' But Africa played a role in that. And the reason we tell this story is to provide the context that space isn't a brand new thing in Africa."
What has changed, however, is that African countries don't just host infrastructure these days — they build and own the infrastructure, design and launch satellites, with space technology specific to the continent's needs.

Space science in Africa is 'niche'
According to Oniosun, it's important to understand that "space is a means to an end" in Africa. It is technology that people use to make their lives better.
"These guys are not thinking, 'We want to go to the moon or Mars.' They're thinking, 'I can use this satellite to provide connectivity to my village. I've got flooding issues, drought issues, my farm is not yielding, and I can use this satellite data to improve that.'"

A lot of satellite data is freely available. But African countries have needs that are specific to the equatorial region, and European and other satellite programs often don't cater to those needs.
Olugbenga Olumodimu, a space program manager at the University of Portsmouth in the UK, thinks African space science is "very niche."
"If I try to replicate [what I do here] in Africa, it is not going to work," he told DW. "So, I have to learn the physics of the equator. You need to understand what they do, to make what you know, applicable."
Sometimes it's a matter of using different instruments to measure region-specific data, or positioning a satellite at a particular angle to achieve the best measurements. But ultimately it comes down to the data people in Africa need.
Take, for example, solar storms — or space weather — which is a global threat. A severe solar storm has the potential to knock out national power grids, and that effect may be the same in more than one region at the same time.
Other effects may vary from region to region. In northern latitudes of the planet, solar storms are considered a threat to radio signals, such as communications between airplanes and ground control stations. In Nigeria, solar storms are considered a greater threat to the performance of petroleum pipelines, a major factor in its hydrocarbon economy.
But put both sets of data together and everyone gets a fuller picture of the effects of solar weather.
"If parts of the Earth are not sufficiently covered like other places, then the science is not complete," said Olumodimu. "We work together to make the science effective."
Olumodimu noted there were plans for a collaboration to design a satellite that will measure space-weather effects in the high- and mid-latitudes and in the equatorial region at the same time.
"When we have that sort of data, it is easier to do what we call global science," he said.
In South Africa, meanwhile, the military is also concerned about the effects of solar weather. It shares that data — for instance, with the European Space Agency — which then in turn makes the data available as a global service.
"Such services usually go on for decades," said Thomas Weissenberg, an external relations Africa expert at the European Space Agency. "A solar storm could hit satellites and simply destroy them. It could be the end of many Earth Observation satellites, communication satellites, Starlink and so on."
Europe and Africa have collaborated on space projects for 30 years. In January 2025, the European Commission recommitted with a new Africa-EU Space Partnership Programme worth €100 million ($117 million).
"[Our partnership] has gotten more intensive, especially in the past five to eight years due to developments in Africa and in Europe as well. Geopolitical reasons might play a role as well," Weissenberg told DW.


African Space Agency marks a new chapter
When the Africa Space Agency (AfSA) was inaugurated in April 2025 in Cairo, Egypt, it may well have marked a new chapter in Africa's space story. AfSA aims to bring countries together to work together, share infrastructure and data.
"You've got countries like Egypt, Nigeria, Algeria and South Africa — some of their national space programs are more than two decades old," said Oniosun. "Then you've got relatively young space programs — the Kenyan Space Agency was founded in 2017, Ethiopia and Rwanda. Countries like that are at a different level. Now, everybody is talking with each other."

Olumodimu distinguishes between "spacefaring" and "space-aspiring" countries, without wishing to offend any of the younger space countries, as he added.
"When we started in Nigeria with the first communication satellite, part of the work was done at the Surrey Satellite Centre, UK, and the launch was done from Asia," said Olumodimu. "But right now, there is quite a lot going on within the African continent itself."
It's hoped that AfSA will aid the transfer of knowledge and technology on the African continent, no matter a country's level of expertise. And it seems to be working: everyone is looking to collaborate with Egypt, AfSA's host country.
"Egypt's ambition is to be at the forefront [of space in Africa]," said Olumodimu.
How AfSA's fortunes will develop, is, however, "uncertain," said Weissenberg. "Africa is even more complicated in Europe." Chances are they will succeed — if alone for the fact that they have the backing of China.
"One word on Egypt," said Weissenberg, "they are smart. They launched a strategic partnership with China."
Weissenberg stresses that China built the whole AfSA site, from the buildings to the technical infrastructure. And in return for their investment, "they get control over Africa. It's that simple."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[As King Charles III hosts Donald Trump for his second UK state visit, expect pomp, protocol and perhaps even meme-worthy missteps.

If there's one word that springs to mind when one hears "state visit," it's probably "protocol." Especially when it involves the House of Windsor, whose namesake castle is where King Charles III will host US President Donald Trump during his second state visit to the United Kingdom this week. Due to renovation work, the gilded halls of Buckingham Palace are off-limits this time.
Typically, US presidents serving a second term are not offered a state visit. Instead, they are invited for tea or lunch with the monarch.
With Trump becoming the first US president to be offered a second state visit, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has described the event as "truly historic" and "unprecedented."
Altogether, there have been less formal state visits from US presidents than one might think: During Queen Elizabeth II's reign from 1952 to 2022, only three such events were held — with George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Trump.

Carriage procession included
Trump — who earlier this year ruffled some American feathers for tweeting "Long live the King" in reference to himself — will be welcomed to Windsor by Prince William and Princess Catherine on Wednesday and treated to a royal carriage procession. This had been avoided on his previous state visit, as security logistics were deemed too complex for the event held in London.



According to Sky News, this week's itinerary includes a military parade, laying a wreath at Queen Elizabeth's tomb in St George's Chapel, a flypast by the Red Arrows and F-35 jets, a formal dinner and plenty of ceremonial flourishes. 
It's a schedule steeped in tradition, but behind the polished silver and ceremonial swords lies a minefield of royal protocol — an etiquette labyrinth where even seasoned statesmen have stumbled.

(In)famous protocol breaches by presidents — or their spouses
During his 2019 visit, Trump famously walked ahead of Queen Elizabeth, leaving the diminutive monarch momentarily obscured behind his hulking figure — a flub that launched countless headlines.
To be fair though, Trump, is hardly the first American leader to fumble the royal rule book.
His predecessor, Joe Biden — wearing his signature Ray-Ban aviator sunglasses — had etiquette experts tut-tutting when he greeted the queen in 2021.
"If you're meeting the queen face-to-face, there's no sunglasses or anything like that at all because eye contact is quite important with any introduction," Grant Harrold, who served as a royal butler to then-Prince Charles, told Newsweek.
Former first lady Michelle Obama once placed a friendly arm around the queen's shoulders in 2009, a gesture that warmed hearts but raised eyebrows.

She later explained in her memoir "Becoming," that the moment was born of sore feet and shared humanity: "Forget that she sometimes wore a diamond crown and that I'd flown to London on the presidential jet: We were just two tired ladies oppressed by our shoes. I then did what's instinctive to me anytime I feel connected to a new person, which is to express my feelings outwardly. I laid a hand affectionately across her shoulder."
She added that if her action was considered "improper" protocol-wise, "I had at least done the human thing."
Going further back to Washington's Camelot era, Jackie Kennedy's 1961 visit with President John F. Kennedy also apparently stirred royal waters. As dramatized in Netflix's "The Crown," her dazzling presence reportedly unsettled the queen, who felt upstaged by the first lady's glamour and intellect. The episode may have taken creative liberties, but it captured the tension that can arise when British ceremony meets American charisma.

Maintaining that stiff upper lip
Queen Elizabeth, who hosted every US president from Harry S. Truman to Biden (save for Lyndon B. Johnson), had the diplomacy game down pat. She maintained her poise and sense of humor over the years, from Bush's 2007 gaffe suggesting she'd visited the US in 1776 to riding horses with Ronald Reagan at Windsor in 1982.
It became part of her mystique: Whether it was a late arrival, an overzealous gesture or a conversational misfire, the queen rarely flinched. 
King Charles has now stepped into her shoes to continue this delicate dance of hosting world leaders. His style is more conversational, less inscrutable — but the stakes remain high.

Potential for meme-worthy moments
As with any high-profile meeting, every handshake, step, glance or even fashion choice will be scrutinized, dissected or memed.
And Trump, never one to shy from spectacle, could deliver — be it his signature "clasp and yank" handshake or a comment that veers off script.
Just this past July at a press conference in Scotland, the president took another swipe at London Mayor Sadiq Khan, calling him "a nasty person" who has "done a terrible job," leaving Prime Minister Starmer, who was seated beside him, momentarily gobsmacked. 
Protocol hiccups notwithstanding, state visits serve to strengthen ties and reaffirm alliances. To be clear, state visits are extended by the British monarch on the advice of the government.
Thus, given the geopolitical state of the world and Trump's potential to either fan or douse flames, British media have referred to this visit as a "royal charm offensive" and "a schmooze fest."
"It's not just about carriages and tiaras. It's about the world agenda," Lord Simon McDonald, former permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office and head of the Diplomatic Service, told Sky News, referring to Trump's 2019 visit.
Yet, for the press and public, it's the pageantry — and the potential for missteps — that makes such visits tantalizing with the possibility of fodder for coverage, clicks and conversations.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[After cuts by US President Donald Trump forced the closure of the popular climate.gov website, experts have launched an independent successor. They say climate literacy is important in Trump's war against science.

US President Donald Trump is an avowed climate science skeptic who during his second term has followed through on promises to slash funding for renewable energies like wind, and to promote oil and gas.
But the administration has also gutted agencies that produce climate information used by millions of Americans. In February, only weeks after taking office, around 800 people were dismissed from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which monitors ocean and climate conditions and issues weather forecasts and warnings via its National Weather Service.
The firings also impacted the agency's climate.gov website, the premier platform for climate information in the US that informs readers about extreme weather, sea level and temperature rise, and much else. It had around 15 million page views in 2024, noted the AFP news agency.

Due to Trump cuts, 'public lost access to a trusted source of climate information'
Trump administration-appointed officials at NOAA not only terminated climate.gov staff, they redirected the homepage to a site controlled by political appointees, noted Rebecca Lindsey, the former manager of climate.gov who was also sacked in February. 
"Our project was likely targeted because of its high visibility," she said.
The site became virtually obsolete after nearly all its remaining staff were fired in early June.
"There is no longer a team to keep the mission going," Lindsey said of a once-dynamic climate portal that was updated weekly and monthly with explanations about the latest impacts of climate change.
"The public has still lost access to a trusted source of timely climate information," she added.
US climate community resists shutdown with independent site
But Lindsey is now leading an effort to relaunch climate.gov independently under the climate.us URL.
"At a moment when critical climate information is being deleted or distorted, we are stepping up to rescue key climate resources … and to ensure the public has continued easy access to the facts," states the recently launched website.

The successor to climate.gov is purposely outside the federal government domain to keep it free from political interference, and thus to protect the integrity of its climate information.
The plan is not only to revive and migrate all the climate data removed from the climate.gov site, but to platform the likes of the National Climate Assessment, the US government's flagship report on climate change impacts, risks and responses before its team of scientists were fired. 
The dismantling of this key climate study was also part of the general defunding of "renewable energy and climate resilience projects" that were financed by Congress during the former Biden administration, Lindsey explained. In March, for example, some $20 billion (€18.3 billion) worth of clean power and climate grants issued by the former government were terminated.
Meanwhile, experts say the shuttering of climate.gov will limit preparedness for extreme weather events. 
"Restricting the visibility of climate data blinds the country to climate effects and makes it that much harder to prepare," wrote the US-based Center for Climate and Security in a blog post in June.

"Without preparation, communities and the nation at large will be forced to react and rebuild, which is far more expensive than working towards prevention," it added, noting that the global economic cost of rebuilding after climate disasters in 2024 was $320 billion (about €272 billion).


What information was actually purged from climate.gov? 
The effort to reestablish a trusted source of climate information comes after much was purged from climate.gov because it referenced so-called "diversity, equity and inclusion," or DEI — a policy that was labelled "immoral" and "illegal discrimination" under a Trump executive order in January.
"Anything that had to do with the importance of diversity and inclusion in science, anything to do with equity, justice or the disproportionate impacts of climate change on historically disadvantaged communities," was deleted from the climate.gov site, Lindsey told DW.
Information mentioning the "Gulf of Mexico" that wasn't updated to "Gulf of America" was also erased after Trump signed another executive order — "Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness" — decreeing the name be changed in all federal agency documents.

These executive orders coincided with others related to climate and renewable energy: one paused offshore wind permits, while another promised to "unleash" high emission oil-, gas- and coal-fired electricity. Meanwhile, in the first weeks of the administration, any mentions of climate change were scrubbed from multiple federal agency websites, including the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency. 
Since it was not "technically possible" to remove all "forbidden" content from the voluminous climate.gov platform, Lindsey said whole sections were removed, including the latest version of the "Climate Literacy Guide," which was authored by the now-disbanded US Global Change Research Program. 
While much of climate.gov's original content remains online, Lindsey speculates that only information deemed "acceptable" — such as blogs about the polar vortex that do not directly relate to climate change science — will be migrated to a new online location before the rest of the site is potentially shut down.
Can climate experts go it alone? 
The first part of the plan for the nonprofit climate.us is to rebirth a complete version of climate.gov by restoring all censored content. 
Then, if it can acquire adequate funding, a new editorial and content team will continuously update the site with the latest climate data and information, including maps and graphics for reuse.
The platform has said it will counter the Trump administration's war on climate science through a collaboration between experts, educators, organizations, universities and civic leaders.
"They're hiding the truth. We're fighting back," runs the climate.us slogan.
But "public donations" — which have already hit $85,000 — will be the key for the site to become fully functioning, said Lindsey. 
"So many people are excited about this effort, so many people say it is giving them hope. And that gives me hope."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Reigning world basketball champions Germany have beaten Turkey in the final to win the European championship.

Germany came from behind in a tightly contested game to beat Turkey 88-83 and win the EuroBasket 2025 final on Sunday in Riga. This comes two years after Germany – with mostly the same players – won their first FIBA World Cup.

After German captain Dennis Schröder was presented with the EuroBasket trophy, he held it high under a shower of gold confetti – before handing it to ailing national team coach Alex Mumbru in a gesture of gratitude.
The Spaniard had been hospitalized with an inflamed pancreas at the start of the tournament and had been replaced as head coach by assistant Alan Ibrahimagic. Mumbru, visibly weakened, had returned to the sidelines for the knockout phase – but Ibrahimagic remained in charge through to the end.

Schröder takes charge in the fourth quarter
Turkey had held a narrow lead throughout most of the final, but Germany bounced back late in the fourth quarter.
The game had 15 lead changes and 11 ties, with the final lead change coming when Schröder scored on a drive to put Germany up by one with 1:15 left. He added a jumper with 18.7 seconds remaining and after Turkey's Alperen Sengun missed a 3-pointer that would have tied it. Schröder sealed gold with a pair of free throws.
Schröder, who finished the game with a total of 16 points and 12 assists was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the tournament – just as he had been when Germany won the FIBA World Cup in 2023.
"We never shy away from the big moments. ... Everybody is so confident," Schröder, who currently plays for the NBA's Sacremento Kings, said.
"Just big-time plays from big-time character people."

Former NBA player Isaac Bonga, who is now with Belgrade club Partizan, was the top scorer for Germany with 20 points.
"You realize how hard you work for this. As a child, you dream of hitting these baskets in such a match," Bonga told German broadcaster RTL.


Key injuries
Franz Wagner, who scored 18 points on the night, brought his brother Moritz to tears by donning his brother's jersey for the award ceremony. Moritz, kept out of EuroBasket by injury, was watching in from California and providing analysis of the match for German broadcaster Magenta. Both Franz and Moritz were members of the 2023 World Cup-winning team.
Also ruled out by injury had been Isaiah Hartenstein, who won the NBA championship with Oklahoma City Thunder in June – while David Krämer and Johannes Voigtmann were forced out just before and during the tournament.
"It was unbelievable," said German Basketball Association (DBB) President Ingo Weiss. "The boys really wanted it and fought until the end. Everyone fights for each other. The team is the star."

Alperen Sengun had 28 points for Turkey, who got another 23 from Cedi Osman and a 13-point, nine-assist, six-rebound game from Shane Larkin in a losing cause.
Germany now two-time European basketball champion
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz congratulated the team for the "sensational performance" in a post on X.

"We are proud of you, you are an inspiration for young female and male athletes," Merz said.
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier attended the final and took part in the awards ceremony in the Latvian capital.
While the team basked in the extensive victory celebration in Riga, congratulations came in from two of Germany's greatest sporting figure. 
"European champions!!!!" wrote  basketball legend Dirk Nowitzki on X.

Former tennis superstar Boris Becker chimed in with: “Yessssss!!!! We won and are European champions!”

Germany's men last won the European Championship in basketball in 1993 – and reached the final in 2005. They finished fourth at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympic Games.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[American influencer and self-styled "Real Tarzann" is being investigated for illegally wrestling wild crocodiles in northern Australia. Critics say animals are suffering to create viral content.

A backlash is growing against a spate of social media videos showing influencers tormenting Australian wildlife. 
Some involve bare-chested men with millions of followers who routinely grapple with and provoke dangerous animals. One recent video posted on Instagram by US citizen Mike Holston, the so-called "Real Tarzann," sees him hunt down and trap saltwater and freshwater crocodiles in Australia's northern state of Queensland. 
In one post, he enters the water and wrestles with a young crocodile before incapacitating it with a throat hold as blood streams down his arm. Within five days, the video had been viewed almost 5 million times.  
But backlash on his Instagram post of the video has been swift: "Respectfully, Australian wildlife are not your props to use for pushing your own 'influence'," read one comment.

The Queensland government said it was "actively investigating" the videos, while its environment department called the actions "extremely dangerous and illegal."  
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has called for Holston to be deported from Australia for his crocodile harassment, and banned from re-entry.  
"The American social media influencer visiting Australia regularly uses animals as props for content, including provoking them and engaging them in reckless, hazardous stunts,” said PETA's Australian branch in a social media post. 
In 2019, the Institute established by primate expert Jane Goodall responded to home videos of Holston interacting with a young chimpanzee, commenting that the influencer "promotes mishandling and inappropriate captive care." 


'A social media stunt' 
In July, another shirtless influencer, Canadian Colton Macaulay, posted a video of himself catching a juvenile freshwater crocodile in northern Australia that was clearly distressed. 
"This is cruelty for the sake of content," Ben Pearson, country director at animal rights group, World Animal Protection Australia, said in response to the Macaulay post. "Crocodiles are not playthings, they're not there to amuse us or be used for a social media stunt. This is exactly the sort of irresponsible behaviour that puts wildlife and people at risk." 
World Animal Protection is calling on social media companies to regulate content that exploits wildlife, saying platforms should "consistently remove harmful content and hold creators accountable."

"Animals will continue to pay the price for online popularity [without] stronger accountability," the animal rights group said in an online blog post. "Influencers who promote unethical and illegal wildlife encounters are fuelling an exploitative industry that thrives on suffering." 
Joey Clarke, senior science communicator with the Australian Wildlife Conservancy, which manages wildlife sanctuaries, also expressed concern about influencers harassing Australian wildlife.  
"We are privileged to have more species of reptiles than any other country, including hundreds of species of lizards and snakes, as well as turtles and crocodiles," he told DW. "It's really disappointing that influencers visiting Australia feel compelled to interfere with wild animals, just to boost their own following online."  
Another US influencer and self-described "outdoor enthusiast and hunter," Sam Jones, sparked outrage in March after posting a video in which she takes a baby wombat from its mother and shows it to the camera as the animal screeches. 
"This is not a situation where you should pick up an animal and brag about it and show it to the camera and stress it out," said US-based wildlife biologist, Forrest Galante, on his YouTube channel. "You're creating stress for the baby, stress for the mother." 
"To take a baby wombat from its mother and clearly causing distress  ... is just an outrage," said Australia's prime minister, Anthony Albanese, of the incident.
Penalties for cruelty to animals in Australia include fines of up to around $30,000 (€25,600) and one year prison sentences.

Viral videos to drive 'copycat tourism' 
World Animal Protection is concerned that these viral videos will have a "ripple effect" among the millions of social media users that view them, leading to "copycat tourism."
"It encourages others to see wild animals as entertainment and trivializes the stress and harm caused by such encounters," stated the wildlife group. 
Joey Clarke of the Australian Wildlife Conservancy also pushed back against people seeking to profit from illegal interactions with the nation's unique fauna.  
"Australia's incredible wildlife deserves to be in the international spotlight, but not grabbed and harassed for social media videos."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The world spends hundreds of billions yearly to punish offenders, with little return beyond more crime and less hope. DW examines how private contractors, organized crime gangs and inmates exploit prison for profit.

Crime may not pay, but prison does. Behind the locked doors and razor wire, a parallel economy thrives. But who's really cashing in?
Governments worldwide spend hundreds of billions annually to keep more than 11.5 million people behind bars — mostly men. The exact global cost is unclear, but in the United States alone — the world's biggest jailer — the prison budget is $80.7 billion (€69.1 billion) per year, versus Brazil at around $4 billion. India, with the world's fourth-largest prison population, spends nearly $1 billion.
Private corporations now profit from incarceration in many countries, from building cells to selling phone calls. Inside, organized crime syndicates run contraband empires and extortion rackets. Inmates, meanwhile, hustle for survival in an underground economy where ramen noodles are currency and labor pays just a few cents per hour.
As well as low rehabilitation rates, governments are also failing to curb another growing crisis — prison overcrowding. Penal Reform International reports that 155 countries struggle with prison overcapacity, with 11 at over double their limit. Facilities in Congo, Cambodia and the Philippines are operating at 300 to 600% occupancy.


Profiting from punishment, privatizing the pain
The private sector has been muscling into prison management since the 1980s, with the US, United Kingdom, Mexico and Brazil increasingly outsourcing operations and services to for-profit firms. Most European, Asian and African countries have so far resisted privatization, with some emphasizing the importance of public accountability.
The US government spends over $3.9 billion per year on private prisons, whose operators earn billions more from others services, including prisoner food, health care and telecommunications. These US prison essentials, known as commissary, are marked up by as much as 600%, while phone calls can cost families up to $16 for just 15 minutes.
While Indian prisons are entirely state-run, Brazil's pay-per-prisoner scheme is criticized as perverse, as it incentivizes private operators like Umanizzare to maximize inmate numbers rather than rehabilitate, leading to prison overcrowding and violence. 
This was seen in multiple prison riots throughout Latin America, including the 2017 riot that killed nearly 60 people at a packed prison in Manaus, the capital of Brazil’s Amazonas state. The facility was costing the government double the national average price per prisoner.

Private companies also build and manage entire prison facilities, supply surveillance tech, run prison labor programs and transport inmates between jail facilities and court. They tend to strip costs right back by understaffing facilities, which reduces inmate services. The results have been mixed.
One of the private sector's major successes is a prison run by British prison operator Serco in Auckland, New Zealand, which claims that just 13.6% of inmates reoffended within two years of release, local media reported in January. This is lower than the 34% rate for government-run prisons and even surpasses Norway's recidivism rate of 20%, considered the global standard for prison performance.
"[Private firms] tend to run prisons more efficiently than the state," Benjamin Lessing, a political science associate professor at the University of Chicago, told DW. "But they're not a panacea and require thorough oversight."

While private prisons get a bad rap for profiting from punishment, state-operated prisons struggle with mismanagement, security threats and inefficiency.
One example saw a New York judge  threaten to reduce a man's sentence for tax fraud to home detention if he were to be sent to a federally-run prison in Brooklyn. The judge described the conditions inside as "barbaric" after several killings, stabbings and severe beatings.


Crime networks thrive inside the walls
Beyond bureaucracy, a darker economy thrives behind bars. Organized crime gangs have embedded themselves deep within the prison system. These groups run drug trafficking, extortion and violence both inside and beyond the gates.
Smuggling contraband like drugs, phones and weapons into prisons is a major source of income. Brazil’s PCC gang, whose name translates as First Capital Command, sells drugs at 10–20 times their street value and smartphones for up to $1,500 on the inside, making millions each year.

The gangs sometimes run the prisons better than the state. Lessing said that when the Brazilian government tried to crack down on gangs, it led to higher incarceration rates and the building of more prisons. Ironically, those new prisons also came under gang control.
"In Brazil, the gangs didn't start as mafia families or drug cartels," Lessing, who is the author of the upcoming book "Leviathans: How Gangs Govern from Behind Bars," explained. "They began in response to brutal conditions in prisons. Their real innovation was to impose a baseline social order — outlawing prison rape, theft, and extortion while rationalizing violence."
Not all gangs are so honorable. In El Salvador, MS-13 ran extortion operations from inside prison, demanding monthly payments from shops, street vendors and taxi drivers, with threats of violence or death for noncompliance.
However, a major crackdown on gangs in 2022 significantly disrupted prison-based extortion operations. The country's murder rate has also plummeted, although the measures have been criticized for human rights violations.
In the US, many gangs operate on racial lines. The white supremacist Aryan Brotherhood profits from drug trafficking and scams involving prison grocery supplies. These schemes often involve inflating prices, controlling inmate purchases, or laundering money through prisoners' accounts.

India’s prison underworld, meanwhile, is also shaped by powerful criminal networks. In New Delhi’s Tihar Jail, extortion, contract killings, and drug trafficking are rampant. In western Gujarat, Sabarmati Central Jail has become a hub for transnational criminal activity, including narcotics smuggling and money laundering.

Convicts cash in on confinement
In overcrowded cells, inmates have built an informal marketplace driven by necessity. Everyday items — instant noodles, soap, cigarettes — become currency in a system where survival often hinges on trade.
Across many prison systems, a brutal borrowing rule applies among cons: take one, repay two or sometimes three. Sometimes known as "double bubble," this system is a form of high-interest credit for the basics in life and contraband, which can quickly trap inmates in cycles of debt and violent retaliation.
Inmates without family money or external funds often turn to dealing drugs to other prisoners just to pay for the essentials. They act as couriers, minders or lookouts in exchange for protection, food, or a cut of the profits. Relatives are sometimes coerced into hiding phones or drugs in body cavities during prison visits or paying off inmate debts.
In Brazil, the modal prisoner is a young, poor, nonwhite male from a favela [slum], affiliated with one of the gangs, who is put in a prison dominated by that gang, Lessing said. While inside, he may not choose to join the gang but will follow their rules and when released, he has contacts who can help him start a drug business or other criminal activity. 
"This is a key way that prisoners bring the gang's power back to the street," Lessing told DW.

Prison labor also helps cut operational costs, with US inmates paid as little as $1–$4 per day for kitchen work, cleaning and laundry. In Indian jails, inmates can earn as little as $0.10 per day, while Brazilian law ensures inmates receive at least 75% of the minimum wage, which is $10 per day.
US prisoners' families, meanwhile, spend $2.9 billion a year on groceries, phone calls and other expenses related to their loved ones' sentences, according to the Prison Policy Initiative. They're often called to pay court fees, restitution, or fines, too.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[A Canadian study has shown that cannabis can have a negative impact on female fertility and the success of IVF treatments. But German experts say more research is needed on factors like age and consumption habits.

Women who want to to get pregnant should refrain from using cannabis. This is the conclusion of a new study that examined the influence of the substance, and its active ingredient THC in particular, on female fertility and artificial insemination. Researchers found that cannabis can negatively affect both because it disrupts the development and stability of the egg cell.
During in vitro fertilization (IVF), egg and sperm cells are brought together in a laboratory. The authors investigated both the effects of THC on isolated human eggs in the laboratory and the IVF results of patients with detectable THC in their follicular fluid. This is the fluid in the ovary that surrounds the egg, where detectable THC means that the woman consumed cannabis before or during the IVF cycle, and that the THC reached the egg cell environment.
The study was conducted by a team supervised by post-doctoral research fellow Cyntia Duval at the CReATe Fertility Centre in Toronto, Canada, in collaboration with scientists from the University of Toronto and other institutions. It examined a total of 1,059 women undergoing IVF, 62 of whom tested positive for THC.

The rates of egg maturation, fertilization, and blastocyst development were examined in THC-positive patients. The blastocyst is the stage of development where the egg implants in the uterus, which is particularly important for a successful pregnancy.
The study also analyzed possible errors in cell division and the probability of an embryo having a healthy set of chromosomes (euploidy). An abnormal set of chromosomes (aneuploidy) is often the cause of miscarriages.
Disruption to egg development and genetic stability
The result was clear: THC-positive patients had a significantly lower rate of euploid embryos, which means that the probability of genetically healthy embryos and a successful pregnancy was reduced.
Although eggs mature slightly faster and more frequently in patients with THC in their follicular fluid, they had significantly fewer embryos with a healthy chromosome set (60% compared to 67% in control subjects). This can reduce the chances of a successful pregnancy and a healthy child.
In the laboratory, THC led to more errors in chromosome distribution and to a defective egg cell structure. Spindle malformations were observed significantly more frequently, especially at higher THC doses. The spindle morphology is important for correct cell division, where errors can result in miscarriages or developmental disorders.
Genetic analyses conducted as part of the study suggest that THC alters the activity of genes in the egg cell that are responsible for the correct distribution of genetic material during cell division. THC also influences genes that control the extracellular matrix — a network of proteins and other molecules that stabilizes cells and is important for embryo implantation and development.


Further research needed, German experts say
The findings on the spindle apparatus are significant, according to Dr. Artur Mayerhofer, head of a working group at the Biomedical Center at the Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU) of Munich, who was not involved in the study: "In my opinion, this is the best data available," he said, but added that he also takes a critical view. "Disorders of the spindle apparatus also increase with a woman's age. So far this has not been taken into account in the study — the number of cases is too small for meaningful statistics."

Dr. Wolfgang Paulus, senior physician and head of the reproductive toxicology center at the Ulm University Hospital, who was also not involved in the study, takes a similar view: "Patients with unfulfilled desires to have children and in vitro fertilization are older on average and more likely to have genetic predispositions, which is why successful pregnancies are often not recorded. THC may have fewer effects on reproduction in young women with no genetic abnormalities.” Future studies should therefore examine the effects of THC on different age groups, he said.
Paulus also criticized the study for lacking information on how much cannabis was consumed in each case: "One limitation of the present study is the lack of data on cannabis consumption habits, such as frequency, timing, dosage, and type of consumption," he said.
Despite the important findings, the mechanism of action of THC remains unclear, according to the LMU's Artur Mayerhofer. "Studies on one type of cell — such as oocytes in a clinical IVF setting — provide only limited information about systemic effects and thus their 'significance in everyday life,'" he said. Future studies should examine "influential factors that have not been taken into account, such as the consumption of other drugs," he said.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The former tennis superstar has written a book about his time in prison in the UK. Boris Becker uses "Inside" to write about his time behind bars, portraying himself as both a fighter and a victim.

The Delphi Filmpalast is a grand cinema located not far from Berlin's fashionable shopping boulevard, the Kurfürstendamm.
Boris Becker arrived clad in a light linen suit and black shirt, accompanied by his pregnant wife Lilian, son Noah, and sister Sabine and her daughters. As he enters the cinema, Becker is mobbed by fans and photographers, and it takes a while for him to get to the stage.
During the presentation his tone wavers between that of an untouchable sporting god ("I have no limits") and a poor wretch cramped in a prison alongside hardened criminals ("we are all equal").
But one central message stands out; Becker doesn't see himself as an intentional perpetrator, but above all as a victim – of a harsh British justice system, of a conspiracy he doesn't explain in detail, and of his sporting success.
A frightening, alien world
The book's title, "Inside," is something of a double entendre. The German tennis legend provides insight into the harsh daily life of a British prison, while also revealing his innermost feelings during this difficult phase of his life.

Becker takes the reader into what, for him, was a previously unknown world of life behind bars. He has no way of protecting himself and his lack of experience in such an environment leaves him with no idea about how best to conduct himself.
That first Wimbledon title
Becker repeatedly references tennis. The distant screaming of prisoners is an "endless rally between opponents who cannot see each other yet still want to destroy each other." The tennis court, he writes, is the same everywhere and offers "certainty in the form of straight lines and white-painted right angles." In prison, however, such certainties do not exist.
Becker traces everything that went right and later went wrong in his life back to July 7, 1985. On that day,as a 17-year-old, he won the men's singles title at Wimbledon – and his life changed overnight. According to Becker, that early success is part of the reason he wound up in prison.
"My 1985 Wimbledon victory is partly to blame for this," he tells fans and journalists at the book launch.

"When you're suddenly so famous at 17, it feels like you suddenly belong to someone else. The German press told me how I should live and what I should do," he writes in the book.
He also puts his later financial problems down to his early fame.
"If I hadn't won Wimbledon at 17, none of this would have happened. Then I wouldn't have had this trust in older men to handle my business, nor the habit of letting others manage my finances."
'Andre gets more love than I do' 
With tennis as the central theme of his life, Becker describes in "Inside" how he spent his months in prison. Surrounded by convicted drug dealers and murderers, Becker says he forged temporary alliances and even made friends. He also explains while being behind bars he encountered the philosophy of stoicism.
He also shares the thoughts that went through his mind during the lonely hours of his imprisonment. These initially concern his rivalry with Andre Agassi, who challenged Becker's status as the crowd favorite at Wimbledon in the early 1990s.
"I need the crowd. I need their support. But when I play against Andre, he gets more of their love than I do," Becker laments.

Later, he recalls how he met his partner Lilian and how the two became a couple. He also describes his long-standing business relationship with Hans-Dieter Cleven, who at one point demanded the repayment of loans totaling €36.5 million ($42.8 million) from Becker and in 2017, initiated insolvency proceedings against him in a London court. The proceedings ultimately led to Becker's prison sentence.


Experienced ghostwriter
Some of Becker's anecdotes from prison are new; others he already told on German television in December 2022, shortly after his early release. At that time, Becker's voice repeatedly failed him.
In the book, many things sound more serene and detached. This is certainly due to the time gap of three years, but possibly also to the work of British sports journalist Tom Fordyce, a ghostwriter who had previously co-authored successful sports biographies.
Personal responsibility, but no moral guilt
Becker doesn't admit to any moral guilt for his misconduct – neither in the book nor on stage in Berlin. He claims that he failed to declare assets to his insolvency administrator for two weeks and used money from the insolvency estate for maintenance, rent, and the costs of a knee operation.
"This can happen to anyone in my position," says Becker.

Becker's son Noah uses his brief time on the microphone to sum up his father's naive hubris.
"He's simply a champion. For champions, there are no defeats. You couldn't talk to him sensibly about it."
Lasting change for the better?
When reading the book, those who saw 17-year-old Boris Becker win at Wimbledon on July 7, 1985, and who followed his tennis career and later life, will find themselves reminded of their own memories of that time. While reading, you can almost hear Becker recounting it in his inimitable voice.
The book also marks the conclusion of a troubling phase of the tennis legend's life. He is now married to Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro. The couple live in Milan and are expecting a child in December. Following the conclusion of his insolvency proceedings in April 2024, Becker is considered debt-free. Whether he can permanently turn his life around – particularly when it comes to managing his finances – remains to be seen.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[HPV疫苗将纳入国家规划。
 
9月11日，国务院新闻办举行“高质量完成‘十四五’规划”系列主题新闻发布会，介绍“十四五”时期卫生健康工作发展成就。
 
据介绍，今年国家将推出面向适龄女生的HPV疫苗接种服务，并且将HPV疫苗纳入国家免疫规划，保护女性的健康。
 
消息一出，万泰生物、智飞生物、沃森生物等疫苗企业的股价都有了小幅上涨。
 
近年来，HPV疫苗赛道陷入了“价格战”，沃森生物、万泰生物的二价HPV疫苗中标价已经降至百元以下。
 
最高端的九价HPV疫苗方面也迎来了剧烈冲击。今年7月万泰生物公布了其国产九价HPV疫苗“馨可宁9”的定价，仅499元/支，价格不到默沙东的一半。
 
在一个越来越“卷”的赛道里，将HPV疫苗纳入国家免疫规划的消息，能否给行业带来利好？
 



2025年9月，北京市正式启动初一年级在校女生人乳头瘤病毒（HPV）疫苗免费接种工作。这也是北京首次推出针对HPV疫苗的免费接种民生项目。图为北京市统一招标采购的国产二价HPV疫苗。 图/视觉中国
 
从地方到全国
 
其实，类似政策并非首次出台了，不过此前的政策文件大都是从地方层面先切入。
 
早在2021年4月，国家卫生健康委就提出将消除宫颈癌行动作为健康城市建设的切入点，推进HPV疫苗应用，加大宫颈癌三级预防。
 
同年9月，首批15个试点城市（区）推动落实宫颈癌综合防控策略工作正式启动。广东、海南、福建等省份以及鄂尔多斯、济南、无锡等城市陆续出台了适龄女孩HPV疫苗免费接种政策。
 
2023年1月，国家卫生健康委等十部门联合印发了《加速消除宫颈癌行动计划（2023—2030年）》。该文件提出，国家层面对于符合要求的国产HPV疫苗要加快审评审批；地方层面鼓励有条件的地区开展HPV疫苗接种试点，探索多种渠道支持资源不足地区适龄女孩接种。
 
国家卫生健康委今年8月公布的数据显示，广东、海南、福建、江苏、江西等18个省份和郑州、鄂尔多斯、石家庄等城市已将接种HPV疫苗纳入政府为民办实事项目，为适龄女孩免费接种国产二价HPV疫苗。统计显示，免费政策已覆盖全国约60%的适龄女孩。
 
据悉，目前我国各地探索实施的HPV疫苗接种项目形式主要包括免费提供、定额补助和医保支付三种形式。具体而言，大部分地区实施国产二价免费、其他种类疫苗定额补助的补贴减免措施。
 
至于目标人群，则多为当地户籍或学籍的13—14岁适龄女孩，部分地区对年龄范围进行拓展或限定为初中某些年级适龄女孩，主要由学校组织动员。此外，少数地区将贫困女性也作为服务对象。
 
由此可见，关于HPV疫苗接种的支持政策其实一直都有，其间遵循着从地方试点到全国推行的发展规律。
 
北京中医药大学卫生健康法学教授、博士生导师邓勇告诉中国新闻周刊，将HPV疫苗纳入国家免疫规划对国民健康影响深远。主要好处有二，一方面是有助于进一步提升疫苗接种率。
 
我国部分地区试点结果显示，90%的9—14岁女孩接种两剂次国产二价疫苗，再配合一定的筛查率，能大幅降低宫颈癌发病率。待全国政策实施后，接种率有望大幅提升，预防效果更加显著。
 
另一方面是有助于促进健康公平。“此前HPV疫苗接种存在地区、经济差异，经济欠发达地区接种率低。纳入国家免疫规划后，可确保不同经济水平家庭、不同地区的适龄女生都能平等获得接种机会，减少健康不公平现象。”邓勇评价。
 
对行业影响或有限
 
近年来，HPV疫苗赛道的竞争持续加剧。
 
2024年，我国HPV疫苗赛道的代表性企业沃森生物、万泰生物、智飞生物都出现了不同程度的营收利润双降现象。
 
今年上半年，下滑态势进一步明显。沃森生物2025年半年报显示，报告期内营业总收入为11.54亿元，同比下滑19.47%，归母净利润为4316.06万元，较去年同期下滑74.69%。
 
万泰生物则交出了一份“史上最差”半年报，2025年上半年实现营业收入8.44亿元，同比下降38.25%；归母净利润亏损1.44亿元，同比下降155.3%。
 
对于此次业绩下滑，公司归因于公司疫苗板块受到市场调整、九价HPV疫苗扩龄等因素影响，导致销售不及预期，疫苗板块收入较上年同期回落。
 
智飞生物更是首次出现半年度亏损，今年上半年实现营业收入49.19亿元，较上年同期下降73.06%；实现归属于上市公司股东的净利润-5.97亿元，较上年同期下降126.72%。
 
艾媒咨询CEO兼首席分析师张毅对中国新闻周刊指出，今年上半年HPV疫苗企业表现普遍不佳，背后与价格战、供需失衡、政策调整等多重因素有关。
 
2019年底，首款国产宫颈癌疫苗，万泰生物的二价HPV疫苗馨可宁获批上市；2022年3月，沃森生物的二价HPV疫苗沃泽惠获批上市。
 
此后为争取更多的市场份额和政府采购订单，双方在定价上展开了激烈竞争，采购价格不断下探。去年，海南、江苏、广东等多地二价HPV疫苗采购中标价格显示，两家公司的疫苗中标价已经降至百元以下。
 
由于二价和四价疫苗受众上有较大重合，智飞生物代理的四价HPV疫苗销量也深受打击。智飞生物2024年年报显示，当年四价HPV疫苗批签发量约46.6万支，同比下滑95.49%。
 
国产二价HPV疫苗争抢市场份额的同时，九价疫苗的竞争也即将进入红海。
 
除了万泰生物的“馨可宁9”已获批上市，沃森生物、上海博唯、康乐卫士和瑞科生物等企业的九价HPV疫苗也已处于三期临床阶段。
 
还有企业试图往更高价次进行突破。今年3月，成大生物宣布，其与康乐卫士合作研发的重组十五价人乳头瘤病毒疫苗已完成I期临床试验，将开启II期临床试验。
 
据了解，十五价HPV疫苗是截至目前全球范围内已上市或已获得IND批准的最高价次HPV疫苗，可将宫颈癌保护率提高至96%以上。
 
那么新的政策，能否给赛道带来一定的利好？
 
邓勇指出，将HPV疫苗纳入国家免疫规划对行业的影响分为短期和长期两个方面。短期影响可能是政府采购价格可能进一步压低，虽采购量增加，但毛利率会下降，稀释自费市场高利润空间，进入“量增价跌”的局面。
 
但从长期来看，这一举措有利于整体提升国产疫苗竞争力，对该赛道属于长期利好。“纳入国家免疫规划后，HPV疫苗接种率提升，让更多人了解并信任国产疫苗，国产疫苗企业市场份额就有望进一步扩大。企业也能借助政策支持加大研发投入，推动技术升级。”邓勇说。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[A now bust German company illegally dumped hundreds of tons of hazardous waste in Czech municipalities. Authorities of both countries have been left to clean up the mess. 
    Hundreds of tons of trash were dumped in the Czech municipality of Jirikov Image: Pryèek Vladimír/CTK/dpa/picture alliance   
In the dead of the night in December, tons of trash mixed with fiberglass debris from wind turbine blades, shredded hard-drives and car batteries were dumped in the small Czech municipality of Jirikov.
If it weren't for mayor Barbora Siskova, the pile of waste that has blotted the landscape ever since would have been even higher. She stopped further trucks sent by a German company seeking to offload more toxic waste weeks after the initial dump.
"I was shown documents that were supposed to prove this is all okay and legal," she told DW, "but I could see at first glance that this wasn't right."
According to the paperwork, the trash to be dumped at the site was plastic waste waiting to be recycled, she said.
"But you could see right away that these weren't plastic bottles or bags full of pure plastic." 
How did hazardous trash end up in Jirikov?
Siskova says a Czech man showed up, pretending to be interested in renting and later buying a former sawmill in Jirikov. He claimed to want it to set up a plastic recycling plant, and that he would temporarily store some materials out in the open.
"The Czech man paid rent once, dumped the trash here and disappeared," she said.
With the help of Czech police and customs officers, she managed to send back the further trucks of hazardous waste and kicked off an investigation.

Other dump sites have since been found in other Czech municipalities, such as in Horni Herspice on the outskirts of the city of Brno.
German authorities have detained the CEO of a German waste management company from Bavaria, along with a Czech truck driver in connection to the case. They are under investigation for illegally sending waste across borders in 21 counts since 2022, deliberately mislabeling trash to skirt requirements.
"The company definitely hasn't done this here in Jirikov for the first time," mayor Siskova said.
Who's paying for the cleanup?
Since the waste management company has gone bust, the cleanup process had been stalled for months and authorities in Germany and the Czech Republic have been left to deal with the mess.
Trash removal of around 300 tons of waste finally kicked off this week, mayor Siskova reported, with the first truck leaving for Germany on Monday. "By the end of next week, it all is supposed to be gone," she said.
The first batch of composite waste has already been shipped off to a facility in the German state of Thuringia. Roughly 260 tons of glass fiber and carbon fiber reinforced plastic waste from items such as rotor blades used for wind energy will be taken to a central site in Hof/Oberfranken in Bavaria and will then sorted, according to the local authorities involved in the cleanup.


The process "is expected to be completed soon," a spokesperson of the local Oberpfalz government in the state of Bavaria confirmed to DW, adding that they were unable to say how much the cleanup would cost.
Since the company allegedly responsible for the dump is now insolvent, the state of Bavaria is paying to have the trash removed. 
"It is currently unclear to what extent these costs will be reimbursed to the state of Bavaria in the ongoing insolvency proceedings."
Environmental fallout still unclear
Once the cleanup in Jirikov is complete, soil and water samples will be taken to investigate whether any environmental damage has been caused, mayor Siskova said.

Analysis from samples taken from Czech environmental organization Arnika back in March found a range of toxins at the site, such as pesticides and compounds of forever chemicals, known as PFAS. These substances were not only present in the waste, but in the surrounding soil, indicating that contaminants are leaching from the waste into the environment.
"Some concentrations were higher than those found at electronic waste sites in Thailand's Kalasin province", which had been a toxic hotspot for years.
"PFAS compounds showed high mobility with potential for groundwater contamination," Nikola Jelinek, Arnika's expert on toxic substances in the environment told DW.


A cross-border waste problem
Czech politicians say such waste dumping is a pan-European issue.
"The problem of illegal cross-border waste exports must be addressed at the European level," a spokesperson for the country's environment minister, Petr Hladik, told DW, adding the minister had pushed for more cooperation in the spring.
"Illegal waste shipments are a serious form of environmental crime, often motivated by economic factors."
And it's a lucrative criminal business. In February this year, Croatian law enforcement authorities arrested 13 people suspected of being part of an environmental crime network, the European law enforcement agency EUROPOL reported.
Their ringleaders are believed to have orchestrated the illegal import of hazardous waste from Germany, Italy and Slovenia to Croatia, dumping or burying trash instead of properly treating it. That reportedly netted them a profit of at least €4 million ($4.7 million).
"Multiple countries across Europe are currently dealing with significant issues related to illegal waste disposal and cross-border waste trafficking," Arnika's Jelinek said.
"The problem has been exacerbated by stricter regulations in Asian countries that previously accepted European waste, leading to increased illegal dumping within Europe itself," she said, pointing to Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia as recent hotspots for illegal waste dumping.
"Criminal organizations have increasingly turned to waste trafficking due to its high-profit margins and relatively low enforcement risk," she added.
How to prevent such environmental crimes?
These crimes often cause irreparable damage to the environment, said EUROPOL, adding that they are usually combined with false documents and financial crimes such as corruption and money laundering.
"The Jirikov case shows that preventing illegal dumping in the future requires much stronger cross-border cooperation and accountability," Jelinek said.

The European Anti-Fraud Office OLAF recently set up a Waste Shipment Enforcement Group that's been tasked with improving enforcement and operational cooperation, both within the EU and with third countries. OLAF monitors suspicious waste shipments with customs and environmental authorities.
"Waste must be traceable across the EU, with digital tracking and transparent databases that cannot be manipulated," Jelinek said.
This has also been echoed by mayor Siskova who welcomes EU-wide digital documentation that's scheduled to come next year.  "And the fines should be higher," she said.
As of now, it looks like the German taxpayer is going to have to foot the bill of the cleanup.
"Prevention also means investing in safe treatment capacity, stricter penalties, and faster legal procedures," said Jelinek, "so that companies cannot profit from insolvency or loopholes while the waste remains in place."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[9月10日的晚上，正带着家人在新疆喀什游玩的西贝创始人贾国龙，发现西贝上热搜了。
 
原因是罗永浩一条吐槽。他发微博称：“好久没吃西贝了，今天下飞机跟同事吃了一顿，发现几乎全都是预制菜，还那么贵，实在是太恶心了。希望国家尽早推动立法，强制饭馆注明是否用了预制菜。”
 
眼看热度居高不下，贾国龙连夜飞回北京，带着团队复盘了一夜，“我们想知道问题出在哪里”。但最后得出的结论是，“做的饭中规中矩，他点的13道菜里也没有一道是预制菜”。
 
在贾国龙看来，罗永浩用“恶心”形容西贝，这是他所不能接受的，“有点砸牌子了”，于是西贝决定起诉罗永浩。
 
那么，西贝能赢罗永浩吗？

预制菜？
 
其实这场仗还没开打，西贝就先吃了两个亏。
 
西贝吃的第一个亏，在于行业和公众对预制菜的认知存在巨大不同。
 
中国新闻周刊曾经报道过，去年3月，市场监管总局联合教育部、工业和信息化部、农业农村部、商务部、国家卫生健康委印发《关于加强预制菜食品安全监管 促进产业高质量发展的通知》，首次从国家层面明确了预制菜的定义和范围。
 
根据通知，中央厨房制作的菜肴，不纳入预制菜范围；同时，仅经清洗、去皮、分切等简单加工未经烹制的净菜类食品，属于食用农产品，不属于预制菜；速冻面米食品、方便食品、盒饭、盖浇饭、馒头、糕点、肉夹馍、面包、汉堡、三明治、比萨等主食类产品不属于预制菜；不经加热或者熟制就可食用的即食食品，以及可直接食用的蔬菜（水果）沙拉等凉拌菜也不属于预制菜。
 
9月11日晚，贾国龙在罗永浩此前用餐的西贝中粮祥云小镇店，对包括中国新闻周刊在内的媒体表示，罗永浩点的13道菜没有一道是预制菜，而且按照国家对于预制菜的定义，整个西贝也没有一道预制菜。
 
贾国龙进一步解释道，西贝采用中央厨房配送模式，即中央厨房对原材料完成清洗、分割等预加工后，根据菜品不同，一周为门店配送三次到五次不等，到店后冷藏或者冷冻保存。
 
但在老百姓的朴素认知中，不是门店现做就是预制菜。而贾国龙的表述，进一步让网友认为：央厨配送不更说明是预制了吗？
 
事实上，西贝确实卖过预制菜。
 
2020年，西贝推出“贾国龙功夫菜”这一子品牌，并在门店销售。然而当着消费者的面，直接加热预制菜，这种服务体验实在不好，这也是西贝第一次因为预制菜被骂上热搜。
 
虽然之后由于市场反馈不佳，功夫菜这个项目被叫停，并且西贝也不在门店销售预制菜了，但这样的来回拉扯反倒让消费者更容易对西贝这个品牌产生混淆。
 
贵不贵？
 
西贝吃的第二个亏，在于被认为贵。
 
其实对于大部分消费者来说，预制菜并非一定不能接受。比如被誉为“日本沙县小吃”的萨莉亚，虽然消费者都知道其卖的是预制菜，但最近两年生意却反倒越来越好。
 
萨莉亚2024财年年报显示，公司营业收入同比增长23%至2245亿日元；营业利润同比增长105.8%至148亿日元；归母净利润同比增长58.1%至约81亿日元，创历史新高。
 
而以中国为中心的亚洲业务强力提升了萨莉亚的盈利能力。报告期内，萨莉亚在中国内地市场的营业收入同比增长27%至529.87亿日元，营业利润同比增长33%至83.54亿日元。
 
所以，从根本上来说，消费者对于西贝最介意的点在于“贵”。这个“贵”如果还和预制菜沾边，那被介意的可能将直接拉满。
 
对于大部分网友来说，对西贝“贵”的认知，很多时候源于两道菜——49元的生菜和21元的馒头。
 
对此，贾国龙也承认过去的定价策略确实存在一些问题，但他同时也强调，西贝对品质的重视，导致原材料成本高，“一分钱一分货”。
 
甚至用贾国龙的话来讲，“西贝贵”是近些年中国餐饮业最大的冤案。据其介绍，今年上半年，西贝净利率不超过5%，其中原材料成本占到30%多。
 
确实，抛开成本谈价格并不客观。
 
西贝以西北菜出道，其当家菜品是牛羊肉，比如牛大骨和烤羊腿。由于牛羊肉的原材料价格本身就要远高于猪肉禽肉，所以这直接拉高了西贝的菜品价格。
 
但抛开感受谈成本也未必合适。
 
其实，无论是餐饮业还是其他服务行业，核心是获得感。但对于绝大多数的消费者来说，一道菜或者一款食物的“品质好”，远比“品质不好”要难感受得多。而“贵”恰是一种主观感受，背后说的是值不值。
 
贾国龙表示，这些年西贝通过菜品结构调整，已经把客单价从2023年的120元降到了现在的80多元。但无奈公众对西贝“贵”的刻板印象已经形成了。
 
生意好？
 
不过对于西贝接下来可能会持续面临争议，贾国龙倒是看得很开。其底气在于持续上涨的客流量。
 
贾国龙表示，今年8月是西贝有史以来客流量最高的一个月，超过2019年、2023年和2024年。
 
在他看来，客流量好，这不正说明消费者认可西贝吗，这不是典型的消费者用脚投票吗？
 
近年来，儿童餐成为餐饮业的一大风口。
 
有调查显示，我国6-12岁儿童经常在外就餐的比例达44.4%。《2023年中国儿童餐食行业研究报告》预测，2025年儿童食品市场规模将突破5000亿元。因此，通过儿童撬动整个家庭消费，正在成为越来越多餐饮企业的共同选择。
 
在国内餐饮企业中，西贝在儿童餐方面起步较早，所以消费者心智相对较强。
 
这源于西北菜“草原牛羊肉、乡野五谷杂粮”的食材优势，以及菜品无过分辛香麻辣、老少皆宜的特点，为西贝打造儿童餐奠定基础。
 
早在2017年，因家庭顾客带儿童就餐需求增多，西贝从提供小米粥、莜面等简易儿童食物起步，逐步推出专门儿童餐。2021年升级为专业儿童餐。2024年，西贝将专业儿童餐提升至战略地位。
 
再加上西贝的品控确实有保障，所以生意好也就不难理解了。2024年，西贝获得了两个围绕儿童餐的重要认证：“服务家庭顾客超2亿人次”以及“专业儿童餐累计销售超4000万份”。
 
面对西贝的反击，罗永浩也准备好了。
 
就在西贝宣布要起诉后，罗永浩表示悬赏10万元，公开向外界征集能证明西贝使用预制菜的“真实证据”。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[9月6日，久未发声的“威马汽车”公众号发布《致供应商白皮书》（下称“白皮书”），其上一次发布内容还是在2023年1月。
 
白皮书宣布，根据2025年4月3日法院裁定批准的重整计划，深圳翔飞汽车销售有限公司（下称“深圳翔飞”）已接管威马汽车科技集团有限公司（下称“威马科技集团”）等四家“威马系”公司，正在全力以赴推动威马EX5和E.5车型在温州基地快速恢复量产。
 
这意味着威马汽车终于迎来“白衣骑士”，但深圳翔飞能救活这家一度与“蔚小理”并列的造车新势力吗？


 



漫长的破产重整之路
 
2023年10月，威马科技集团申请破产重整，并于当年12月底，获得法院受理。次年1月初，法院指定北京大成（上海）律师事务所与立信会计师事务所（特殊普通合伙）作为联合管理人。
 
随后，管理人发布《关于威马科技集团招募战略投资人的公告》。其中提到，威马科技集团及其下属关联企业除持有房屋土地等不动产、设备存货等动产外，其名下还拥有稀缺的整车生产资质、新能源汽车生产相关的无形资产等。2024年3月，法院确认其负债203.67亿元，资产仅39.88亿元。
 
直到今年1月，威马科技集团重整案债权人会议召开，审议并表决重整计划（草案）是议程之一。接盘方浮出水面，根据重整计划（草案），当时仅剩深圳翔飞仍有投资意愿。
 
深圳翔飞接盘后，首先面临的问题是债务如何清偿。根据白皮书，15万元以下债务可一次还清，15万元以上债权人暂获得15万元现金，以上部分通过信托受益权暂抵，等待信托资产变现。
 
在发出债务清偿计划之余，白皮书还明确了新威马分三步走的2025—2030年经营发展规划。其中2025—2026年被视为“复兴阶段”，目标包括2025年9月复产EX5/E.5车型，确保年产销量1万台，争取实现产销2万辆；同时海外破局，布局泰国KD工厂，开拓东南亚及中东市场。2026年目标是量产10万台。
 
在随后的发展和跨越阶段，新威马将2027年、2028年的年销量目标定在25万台、40万台，而2030年则将挑战100万台产量。
 
这是威马历史上不曾达到过的产销量。作为一家成立于2015年年初的新势力车企，威马在温州、黄冈两地自建工厂，规划产能分别为年产10万辆、15万辆。不过，根据威马创始人沈晖在2023年介绍，黄冈工厂只在2022年全年都安排生产，产量为1万余辆。“从理论上讲，黄冈工厂一年开二十几天就够了，其他时间都是停的。”
 
此次宣布即将复产的EX5/E.5车型是威马的主力车型，EX5是威马的首款量产车型，早在2018年便已上市，两款车2023年年初售价在20万元左右。从2019年到2021年，威马的年销量分别为1.69万台、2.25万台、4.4万台。年销4.4万台已经是巅峰。
 
白皮书称，新威马“在2025年8月份恢复具备量产能力”。具备“量产能力”并不等于量产，有车企工厂负责人向《中国新闻周刊》解释，不同整车厂所需的工人、零部件数量不尽相同，一方面与产量、车型挂钩，另一方面与工厂的加工深度有关，一些整车厂只是将供应商提供的零部件进行拼装，因此生产环节本身对于一家成熟工厂来说并不困难，重要的是如何重建与供应商的合作关系。
 
这位负责人说：“即使是那些稳定经营的车企，一辆车的产品周期相比过去也在缩短，供应商在做相应的投入时都会考虑投入产出比，比如考虑投资一些设备后能否循环利用。”
 
车企往往与供应商需要紧密合作，特别是新车研发过程中，新威马计划在明年推出A00级轿车和小型SUV两款新车。以电池为例，并非车企简单地向电池厂商“下单”那么简单。
 
有电池厂商人士向《中国新闻周刊》解释，即使电池厂商供应的电池包可以直接安装到车辆之上，电池厂商需要与车企在立项初期就进行同步开发，根据车企需求，形成产品方案，在这个过程中需要高效沟通，甚至现场解决问题。而且出于安全与减少资金占用的考虑，进入量产阶段后，电池厂商会尽可能降低库存，这就需要其与车企协同，高效响应其需求。
 
白皮书称，供应链团队已完成对215家历史供应商的联络，并为供应商描绘出预期可获具体利益，比如参与第一阶段（400辆在线车辆）的供应商将从早期收入机会中受益，并在2025年第四季度批量两万台生产中获得优先权。
 
“宝能系”的新尝试
 
威马曾是造车新势力中的明星企业。作为国内最早的一批造车新势力，威马汽车由吉利集团前高管、沃尔沃中国区前董事长沈晖创立，沈晖在汽车行业积累深厚，曾带领团队完成中国汽车工业历史上最大海外并购——“吉利收购沃尔沃”，并负责重组沃尔沃全球的治理架构，一举使中国成为沃尔沃全球最大和最盈利的市场。
 
威马一共有12轮融资，累计融资超350亿元。威马曾拿出大批资金建厂，创业初期，威马自建生产线，温州工厂一期工程规划总投资67亿元，黄冈工厂总投资更是超200亿元。
 
这一次，深圳翔飞作为“接盘者”能否支撑新威马的野心？
 
深圳翔飞表示，初期预计投资10亿元用于设备升级、供应链恢复和产品开发等。其在白皮书中特别强调获得地方政府直接支持，包括融资支持，“在温州市政府的支持指导下，新股东翔飞汽车正与当地金融机构积极开展对接沟通，以股东的优质资产等作为增信开展融资，为新威马复工复产所需的设备升级、供应链恢复和运营扩展资金提供保障”。
 
深圳翔飞成立于2023年9月，背后投资人几经变更，目前呈现“套娃式”的股权结构，两家股东“你中有我，我中有你”，与“宝能系”的昆山宝能汽车有限公司、深圳悠宝利新能源汽车销售有限公司等有着众多股权联系。
 
这些公司都是“宝能系”在汽车产业长期布局的结果，悠宝利就是宝能汽车旗下乘用车品牌，其曾在微信公众号发文称，今年6月首批A00级轿车“悠宝利A3”从深圳宝能汽车工厂下线。
 
“宝能系”此前在汽车产业的尝试难言成功，宝能汽车集团有限公司作为被告身份涉案数量为349件，涉案金额总计达到208.06亿元。接盘威马汽车可以被视为“宝能系”在汽车产业的又一次尝试，而这不是威马第一次迎来“白衣骑士”。
 
2023年1月，威马汽车曾发布消息，Apollo智慧出行集团有限公司与威马集团达成有条件买卖协议，并建议配售股份款项总额将约为39.18亿港元，建议临时融资约7.2亿元。不过这次收购在2023年9月正式终止，威马汽车最终也走向破产重整。
 
在国内竞争激烈的汽车市场，这次深圳翔飞能否真正让威马汽车“复活”，还是未知数。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[针对罗永浩吐槽，西贝决定反击。
 
9月10日，罗永浩发微博称：“好久没吃西贝了，今天下飞机跟同事吃了一顿，发现几乎全都是预制菜，还那么贵，实在是太恶心了。希望国家尽早推动立法，强制饭馆注明是否用了预制菜。”
 
9月11日，西贝餐饮集团召开媒体沟通会，会上，西贝餐饮创始人贾国龙对包括中国新闻周刊在内的媒体表示，自己昨天紧急从新疆喀什飞回北京，并带领同事复盘了一个晚上，想知道问题出在哪里。
 
据其介绍，9月10日下午2点左右，罗永浩一行5人来到西贝中粮祥云小镇店用餐，一共点了13道菜，有2道还点了两次，其中没有一道是预制。最后一共只有2道菜没吃完，临走时，罗永浩还对门店服务员表示“挺好”。


 

 
对于罗永浩的吐槽，贾国龙表示不解，在他看来，罗永浩用“恶心”形容西贝，感觉有点被砸牌子了，挺受伤的，其已经超出普通消费者行为，未来公司将起诉罗永浩。
 
贾国龙还表示，9月12日起，西贝将推出罗永浩同款菜单，同时全国所有门店后厨将对外开放，消费者可以看任何一道菜的制作过程。
 
对于西贝贵的说法，贾国龙认为这是中国餐饮业近些年最大的冤案。他表示，西贝奉行优质平价的价格策略，今年上半年利润率不超过5%，其中原料成本和人工成本分别占30%多。
 
在西贝表示没有一道是预制菜后，罗永浩发微博回应称：“如果不是预制菜，那就太牛了。能把现做的菜做得全是重新加热的味道，这肯定是高科技了。”

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Germany have defeated Slovenia and Luka Doncic to reach the semifinals of EuroBasket 2025. The Los Angeles Lakers star may be virtually unstoppable, but he does have his weaknesses.

Even before Wednesday's EuroBasket quarterfinal between Germany and Slovenia, one thing was clear: if you want to beat the Slovenians, you have to get a grip on their superstar Luka Doncic.
"He is extremely versatile on offense and can shoot extremely well. But his greatest strength is how he finds his teammates and controls the game," said Germany's best player, Franz Wagner, about Doncic.
"We'll see how much we can limit him. We'll have a few ideas," interim Germany coach Alan Ibrahimagic said.
"You can't stop him. You have to find ways to beat the team," said point guard Maodo Lo.
The Germans managed to do just that, winning the match 99-91. Still, Doncic was once again the best player on the court with 39 points and 10 rebounds. He had already contributed 42 points and 10 rebounds to Slovenia's 84-77 victory over Italy in the round of 16.

NBA Rookie of the Year
Luka Doncic comes by his basketball talent naturally – father Sasa Doncic was also a professional player who represented Slovenia. In 2018, coming off a season in which he was named MVP of the both the EuroLeague and the EuroLeague Final Four, Doncic moved across the pond to join the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.
In his debut season, he averaged 21.2 points, seven rebounds, and six assists per game – earning him the NBA Rookie of the Year award.
In his 450 NBA regular-season games, Doncic has averaged 28.6 points, 8.6 rebounds, and 8.2 assists per game. He has achieved a triple-double over 80 times, something most NBA players achieve only a few times, if at all, in an entire career.

Complete offensive player, defensively flawed
Doncic is known for his skill with the ball, his long-range shooting, and his ability to outwit multiple opponents when driving to the basket. Offensively only his free-throw percentage leaves room for improvement.
His defensive game, though, is another story. Here, he has faced criticism for not getting back down the court enough to defend his own basket – something that has led to discussion about his fitness. Listed at 230 pounds on his 6'6" frame, questions have also been asked about the Slovenian's weight.
Even Doncic himself has admited to complaining to the officials too oftenImage: BEAUTIFUL SPORTS/picture alliance

"It's really hard to always give it your all on both ends of the court," he once conceded in an interview.
Doncic is a polarizing figure who often infuriates opponents and fans alike with his on-court behavior, often arguing calls with the officials.
"I complain way too much," he once said – apparently without figuring out how to curb the practice.
In February of this year, the Mavs shocked NBA fans by sending Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers in a three-team trade. It seemed that not only were Dallas management dissatisfied with Doncic's work defensively, but with his deal set to expire, they also wanted to avoid having to sign him to a "supermax" contract that would have cost them a whopping $345 million through 2030.


Controversial trade to the Lakers
The trade shook the entire league with NBA stars like Joel Embiid, Kevin Durant, and Devin Booker expressing dismay that the Mavericks would give up a player considered the cornerstone of the franchise.
Dennis Schröder said at the time, comparing North American professional sports, in which trades are commonplace, to "modern-day slavery."

Doncic's deep emotional connection to the Mavericks was evident upon his return to Dallas two months later. Before the match, the Mavericks honored their former star with a video that brought tears to Doncic's eyes.
But all his emotion didn't stop him from scoring 45 points in the Lakers' 112-97 victory.
Renewed motivation despite no 'supermax' payoff
The Slovenian has since come to terms with his new situation and signed a new three-year, $165 million contract with the Lakers [having been traded, he had lost his eligibility for a "supermax" contract].

"I'm just very happy to be here," Doncic said after signing. "This is the Lakers organization – one of the best teams in history."
A faster, fitter Doncic?
His renewed motivation led to him working hard to improve his fitness and athleticism over the summer.
"I'll obviously be a little faster next season," he joked at a recent press conference.
His improved fitness was obvious a few weeks before the European Championship when Germany played two friendlies against Slovenia. But in Wednesday's quarterfinal, Doncic looked like his old self; complaining about numerous refereeing decisions – all while doing extraordinary things with the basketball.
This article was originally published in German and first published in English on September 10, 2025. It was updated on September 11, 2025, to reflect the result of Germany's quarterfinal match against Slovenia.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[A Spanish court ruling on pollution from industrial pig farming could have far-reaching implications for how animals are kept across Europe.
    One pig can produce a staggering 2 tons of urine and feces every year (file photo) Image: Josep Lago/AFP   
In the northwestern Spanish region of Galicia, locals have been contending with foul smells, dangerous drinking water and a deteriorating natural environment for years. The alleged culprit: industrial pig farming.
"This used to be a paradise," said local environmental activist Manuel Garcia, standing near a pile of waste from nearby pig and chicken farms. "People here, when they had bad harvests, fed themselves with what nature provided. Hunting, fish, frogs."
But as pig and chicken farms have expanded over the decades, Garcia has seen his home district of A Limia deteriorate. Pigs produce a staggering 2 tons of urine and feces annually. By comparison, an average dog excretes around 270 pounds (122 kilograms) of waste a year. 
The waste is rich in nitrates, which can be useful as fertilizer but is harmful in excess. Garcia said nitrate runoff has killed fish and frogs, polluted wells and transformed what he remembers as the lush Lima River into something resembling "a sewage treatment plant." 


A farmer by profession, Garcia has spent much of his time in recent years raising awareness of the problem. He said much of the pig waste has been dumped without proper precautions.
But in July 2025, a group of residents, backed by scientists and lawyers, won a case against regional authorities over unchecked livestock pollution that they say harmed the environment and violated their human rights. The first ruling of its kind in Europe, it could set a blueprint for other communities and may even reach the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, where a decision could force change at the national level.
"While the Spanish court granted regional remedies, a Strasbourg ruling could go further by recognizing structural failings," Malgorzata Kwiedacz-Palosz, senior fundamental rights lawyer with ClientEarth, told DW. "[It could require] Spain to implement systemic reforms, including improved nitrate monitoring, farm regulation and water quality protections."
Why locals took the fight against pig waste to court 
The case used evidence from the wider Lima River basin but centered around the town of As Conchas and its large reservoir. With all the waterways from the basin flowing into the reservoir, its waters have become progressively more polluted since the 1990s.

Pablo Alvarez Veloso and Mercedes Alvarez de Leon, two of the claimants, recalled when the reservoir was central to recreational and social life. "Little kids played on the shore, older ones swam. And that was a hub of relationships," said Alvarez Veloso.
Today, swimming is often forbidden due to pollution. In warmer months, blue-green algae cover the surface, a visible sign of eutrophication caused by excessive nutrients like nitrates from fecal waste and over application of fertilizer. The blooms suffocate wildlife and release carbon dioxide as they die. The combination of nearby farms and dying algae means the area is constantly plagued by strong odors, said locals. 
Despite the environmental degradation and complaints from residents, local and regional authorities have claimed not to know where the damage is coming from.
Livestock waste is usually diffuse and hard to trace, making such legal cases difficult. But in the Galicia case, there was evidence. 
According to nitrate specialist Serafin Gonzalez, one of the expert witnesses who testified, healthy water should contain less than 10 milligrams (or 0.00035 ounces) of nitrates per liter. But he said his meta-analysis of studies on the region found "about 10% of the samples are above the legal limit. There are also records published in scientific journals up to 329 milligrams per liter."

A 2021 Greenpeace investigation found nitrate levels of up to 130 milligrams in wells in A Limia. Besides impacting the environment and local wildlife, high nitrate levels can cause blood abnormalities that are potentially fatal to young babies. Other toxic chemicals and antibiotic-resistant bacteria were also detected.
By analyzing the samples, nitrate specialist Serafin concluded industrial farming was overwhelmingly responsible and that the pollution most likely didn't come from other sources. "From the evolution of the human population and industrial farming, we are sure that the main origin is industrial farming — 98%, 99% sure," he said.


Why the residents won and what's next?
Residents won recognition that their fundamental human rights under Spanish and European law had been violated. Authorities have been ordered to compensate the claimants, clean up the river and take measures to prevent more pollution from entering the water.

But the case could still be appealed to Spain's Supreme Court and possibly to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Kwiedacz-Palosz, of ClientEarth, said a ruling at this level "could significantly enrich European human rights law" and "elevate the issue from a regional failure to a matter of state responsibility under international law." 
A Strasbourg case on livestock pollution has never been heard, making it a chance to clarify countries' obligations on excess nitrate, livestock farming odors and antibiotic-resistant bacteria in water. This is relevant across Europe, where the European Commission says 81% of nitrogen in waterways comes from livestock. 
A ruling at the European level could set a precedent for countries around the world legislating on similar issues. Even if it doesn't go all the way to Europe, the Spanish ruling could provide a blueprint for other claimants.
"You need to link the pollution to the source, which is livestock. And we manage to do in this case. And as the judgment is publicly available, it can be seen how we managed to do it," said Kwiedacz-Palosz.

        <id>http://news.inewsweek.cn/finance/2025-09-11/26658.shtml</id>
        <link href="http://news.inewsweek.cn/finance/2025-09-11/26658.shtml"/>
        <updated>2025-09-11T02:31:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[近年来，光伏行业“内卷式”竞争不断加剧，部分企业通过虚标功率、低价倾销、低质竞争扰乱市场，导致产业“增产不增收”“增收不增利”“赔本赚吆喝”，造成产品质量下降和安全风险突出。
 
根据中国光伏行业协会数据，当前光伏各环节年产能超1100GW，而2025年全球与中国乐观需求分别仅为600GW和250GW，产能已达全球需求的1.8倍。同时，叠加产品同质化、技术创新不足，低价竞争愈演愈烈。
 
今年以来，工业和信息化部等部门多次出手治理光伏产业无序竞争。从治理效果来看，光伏产业的“反内卷”已初见成效。
 
2025年8月19日，工业和信息化部、中央社会工作部、国家发展改革委、国务院国资委、市场监管总局、国家能源局等六部门，联合召开光伏产业座谈会，进一步规范光伏产业竞争秩序。
 
会议主要讨论四大方向，包括加强产业调控，以市场化法治化方式推动落后产能有序退出；遏制低价无序竞争，打击低于成本价销售；规范产品质量，打击侵犯知识产权等行为；支持行业自律，发挥行业协会作用等。
 
今年以来，有关部门还围绕新能源车、电商平台等新兴行业开启了“反内卷”行动。
 
不同行业的“内卷”，表象上主要是激烈的价格战，但背后驱动的原因并不完全相同。因此，除了召开行业座谈会，深入分析各行业的差异，再对症下药同样重要。
 
未来，需从以下几个方面入手，规范光伏产业相关市场秩序，推动行业从“规模扩张”向“质量跃升”转型。
 
强化市场优胜劣汰机制。畅通落后低效产能退出渠道，充分利用市场化法治化手段推动落后产能有序退出，推动相对落后的PERC（发射极和背面钝化）电池产能出清。强化光伏产业项目投资管理。支持光伏龙头企业开展“承债式”兼并重组、关停闲散产能。加强多晶硅等关键环节产能调控。
 
健全价格监测机制。开展企业“价格战”专项治理行动，研究设定违规低价倾销的判定标准与监管红线。建立产品价格监测机制，构建重点产品标准成本与标杆成本参照系，对价格明显低于参照成本的企业及时进行约谈警示，必要时启动反不正当竞争调查，严打低于成本价销售、虚假营销等行为。将价格评分标准从“低价中标”改为综合参考平均报价和行业协会发布标杆成本的方式，不能通过调价机制及藏价、暗价等方式规避标杆成本约束。尽快出台系列光伏产品价格指数，解决招投标价格难确定问题。
 
规范产品质量和加强知识产权保护。加强对光伏组件产品质量抽查的力度，严厉打击降低质量管控、虚标产品功率等行为，曝光典型违法案例。研究制定商业秘密保护法，明确通过“恶意挖角”“违规猎聘”等侵害商业秘密行为的认定标准和惩罚措施。全面实行知识产权侵权纠纷的调解优先推荐机制，推行举证责任转移、举证妨碍推定等举证规则，在侵权问题多发频发的光伏等重点行业加快适用，破解维权周期长、举证难等问题。
 
支持行业自律。发挥光伏行业协会作用，倡导公平竞争、有序发展，强化技术创新引领，严守质量安全底线，切实维护行业良好发展环境。行业协会可引导光伏企业减少单纯扩大产能的光伏制造项目，鼓励企业从效率、成本、构网能力等各个方面提升技术能力，在原创性、引领性、前瞻性技术上加大创新力度，引领光伏产业进入竞争无人区。鼓励企业参与光伏行业绿色低碳相关标准修订工作。鼓励光伏行业企业兼并收购，鼓励通过兼并收购来完成过往的产能扩张目标。
 
规范地方招商引资。鼓励各地按照区域主体功能定位，科学分析当地资源禀赋条件，因地制宜发挥比较优势开展招商引资。加强招商引资信息披露，促进地方政府招商引资的政策、流程、承诺等更加公开透明。健全地方招商引资决策和评价机制，完善招商引资考核机制，大力推进科学、精准、合规招商引资。鼓励地方政府探索形成招商引资共享机制及具体办法，推进首谈地和承接地的招商指标、经济指标、财政分成等分享。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The discovery is among the strongest evidence yet that the red planet may have once harbored life. However, scientists say more study is needed, ideally in labs on Earth.
    The mission of the Perseverance rover is to determine if there was once microscopic life on Mars Image: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS/REUTERS   
NASA's rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks that may hold potential signs of ancient microbial life on Mars, according to research published Wednesday.
Since landing on the Martian surface in 2021, the rover has been searching for signs of ancient life in Jezero Crater, a region in the planet's northern hemisphere that was once flooded and contained an ancient lake basin.
In summer 2024, Perseverance discovered newly identified "Sapphire Canyon" rock samples in the reddish, clay-rich mudstones of Neretva Vallis, a river channel that once carried water into Jezero Crater. The samples were then examined using all the scientific instruments aboard the rover.
NASA's science mission chief, Nicky Fox, acknowledged that the latest analysis "is certainly not the final answer," but said it's "the closest we've actually come to discovering ancient life on Mars."

What do scientists say?
Stony Brook University planetary scientist Joel Hurowitz, who led the study published in the journal Nature, said that researchers detected a "potential biosignature" in multi-billion-year-old sedimentary rocks.


These potential biosignatures took the form of two minerals that appear to have formed from chemical reactions between mud and the organic matter present in it, Hurowitz said.
The minerals are vivianite, an iron phosphate, and greigite, an iron sulfide. "These reactions appear to have taken place shortly after the mud was deposited on the lake bottom. On Earth, reactions like these, which combine organic matter and chemical compounds in mud to form new minerals like vivianite and greigite, are often driven by the activity of microbes," Hurowitz explains. 
Vivianite is often found in sediments and peat bogs on Earth, as well as in areas with decaying organic matter. Some forms of microbial life can produce greigite. "The microbes are consuming the organic matter in these settings and producing these new minerals as a byproduct of their metabolism," he added.

More study needed on Earth
Although scientists cannot say with certainty that they have found signs of ancient microbial life, they consider the findings to be convincing.
"It's kind of the equivalent of seeing like leftover fossils, you know, leftovers from a meal, and maybe that meal has been excreted by a microbe. And that's what we're seeing in this sample," Nicky Fox, administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, told journalists.
Hurowitz explained that researchers would need to analyze the sample in person to determine whether microbial activity had created the fantastic textures and colors, including blue and green.
Ideally, this analysis would be conducted in labs on Earth before drawing any conclusions. "There are non-biological ways to make these features that we cannot completely rule out on the basis of the data that we collected," Hurowitz said.
However, bringing the samples back to Earth could be challenging, especially since the Trump administration is considering canceling the Mars Sample Return program.
According to Hurowitz, until samples are transported off Mars by robotic spacecraft or astronauts, scientists will have to rely on earthly stand-ins and laboratory experiments to evaluate the feasibility of ancient Martian life.

When Volkswagen chief designer Andreas Mindt looks at the electric ID.Polo, he sees a friendly, familiar face. And that's exactly the point.  
Standing before the still-camouflaged model at the IAA auto show in Munich, Germany, Mindt described a shift away from the futuristic, sparser design language of recent ID models. 
"When you look at the face here, it's very optimistic," Mindt said, pointing to the front. "It's uplifting. All the lines are up-rising so that it looks friendly and positive and optimistic."
A similar approach is visible across this year's IAA Mobility show, where European carmakers are rethinking electric-vehicle design and marketing.

Struggling to broaden the appeal of their EV offerings, many are now emphasizing brand familiarity over novelty.

Mercedes has announced it's merging the design palette for combustion engine and electric vehicles for coming models. Its motto "Welcome Home" comes as the brand approaches its 140th year of existence.  
And while BMW's new ix3 electric SUV is impressively modern on the exterior and interior, the iconic front grill — known as the kidneys — were modeled on a series from the 1960s, the "Neue Klasse" ("New Class").

But it's Volkswagen where the shift is most visible. Days before this year's IAA Mobility show, the firm announced it would scrap the numbers-based naming convention for the ID family. It started with the ID.2, now named the ID.Polo, after a model familiar to generations of European drivers. 
"You've got to stay modern, you've got to stay ahead of the curve," Thomas Schäfer, CEO of the brand Volkswagen and Mindt's boss, said. "But you have to stay true to the brand, too."
The vehicle also looks more like a traditional Polo, with its slimmer profile, stronger lines and exposed wheel arches. Its interior will see the return of physical buttons for controlling features like climate control — a customer demand.
The exterior also boasts thicker rear lights, Mindt said, one of several features intended to suggest sturdiness. "They look like thick glass, whiskey glasses, you know what I mean? It's not like a champagne glass, which breaks."


Back to the basics
The design is something of a return for the Wolfsburg, Germany-based car company, which only earnestly embarked on EV production in the aftermath of the 2015 diesel emissions scandal. New CEO Herbert Diess was an advocate of transformation and an outspoken admirer of Elon Musk, who was then turning Tesla into the world's largest electric car producer, a position openly coveted by Volkswagen.  
Diess retained control of the Volkswagen brand, technically a separate position, to shepherd the design and release of its first purpose-built electric car, the ID.3. Volkswagen's design chief said in interviews at the time that the hatchback's look, with its flowing panels and fewer clear lines, was meant to represent a break with the past. 
But Volkswagen stumbled out of the gate with the ID.3. Software problems hobbled the car's appeal and loomed over Volkswagen in the following years, costing Diess his job in 2022.

The ID series would still go on to become best-sellers among European battery-electric vehicles. Yet overall electric sales remain underwhelming in Europe, at less than 16% market share, according to European auto industry data, with uptake having slowed in recent years. 

Making a 'true Volkswagen'
As Schäfer took over the Volkswagen Brand in 2022, he pushed against the prevailing ID design and marketing.
"It was all about, when I talked to the team, what do we have to do to make a true Volkswagen again?" Schäfer told DW in an interview. 
Design was a major part. Schäfer fired the company's head of design in 2024 and hired Mindt.
His instructions: "He wanted a true, proper Volkswagen," Mindt said.

The company is now counting on his work to pay off. The ID.Polo shares its drive system with five other models to be launched by Volkswagen in the coming months, including a GTI variant and new offerings from Skoda and Cupra.
Winning through scale is important to the automaker, which faces a tougher market. The competition from Chinese carmakers is fiercer, and even the premise of electric drive systems more divisive with the rise of populist politics and the return of Donald Trump to the US presidency. 
For design chief Mindt, that divisiveness is one more reason to focus on what he calls "uplifting" design. Buyers will understand his intent with the ID.Polo, he believes, even if they can't explain it. 
"Sometimes you don't need to explain that," Mindt said. "They feel it with their heart."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The government's development bank is accused of backing harmful projects in emerging markets. Instead of uplifting communities, a new report says investments fail to protect human rights and silence those who speak out.

You've probably never heard of KfW. It's a national development bank — the world's largest — backed by the German state and established to funds projects around the world, ranging from roads in Africa to water systems in Asia.
But what happens when projects backed by the lender displace a village, pollute a river, or silence dissent?
A new report on KfW Bank’s human rights record says these aren't just hypotheticals; they're real risks and they're not being handled well enough.
Known by the slogan "Responsible Banking," KfW is backed by billions in public money. So those failures aren’t seen as just tragic; they're paid for by German taxpayers.

What is KfW Accused Of?
Compiled by the Coalition for Human Rights in Development — a grouping of civil society organizations — the report raises concerns about how KfW's overseas projects are affecting vulnerable communities.
The coalition, which includes Urgewald, a German-based watchdog group known to track the social and environmental impacts of global finance, took aim at KfW's slogan, accusing the lender of "irresponsible banking" and causing "hidden harms."
Development banks like KfW try to highlight how they are shaping futures in emerging economies. But the report alleges that infrastructure projects funded by the lender led to forced relocations of Indigenous communities in Indonesia and Mexico. Plans to back a graphite project in Tanzania were criticized for taking place without adequate engagement with locals or compensation. 
Marc Fodor, campaign coordinator at the Coalition for Human Rights in Development, thinks for KfW, social issues are "just an add-on" to business deals.
Speaking with DW, Fodor said the report reveals that many projects backed by KfW were launched without prior informed consent from local populations, violating international standards on Indigenous rights and participatory development.


Locals who complained faced reprisals
Fodor also noted that KfW's own investigation into serious reprisals in Indonesia, where Indigenous people were reportedly arrested and beaten, concluded only that "free, prior and informed consent had not been respected."
"It wasn’t just that people weren’t consulted. It was much more serious than that," he said.

Apart from naming controversial KfW projects, the report criticized the lender's complaints procedure as lacking "provisions to ensure independence," adding that the lender was failing to "prevent, address and remedy reprisals against those raising concerns" around the impacts of its projects.
The report doesn’t accuse KfW of deliberate wrongdoing, but it does suggest that the bank’s due diligence and oversight are falling short and are often unclear.
"It's a maze… I was unable to understand what the policies are — even though that’s my bread and butter," Fodor told DW.
KfW has disputed some of the claims in a response to DW below.

What is the coalition urging KfW to do?
To move forward, the rights groups say KfW must go beyond procedural reforms and embrace structural change. That means establishing an independent accountability mechanism across all its international operations with clear human rights safeguards.
Additionally, they are calling for proactive policies to prevent reprisals, public access to project documents and meaningful consultation with affected communities before any financing is approved.
Many other development banks have already taken steps in this direction. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, for example, publishes detailed environmental and social assessments online.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) — the EU's international development finance lender — has a centralized complaints office with partial independence.
Compared to these institutions, KfW relies on partner policies and scattered grievance systems, the report criticized, which leave gaps that can allow harm to go unchecked.

What does KfW have to say?
In response to the report, KfW issued a statement defending its practices. It says that for all three international business areas of the KfW, respect for human rights and responsible management of environmental and social risks are "a matter of course."
"All financing by KfW and its subsidiaries is subject to sustainability guidelines. These require procedures and standards for environmental and social impact assessments for all financed projects," the statement added.
KfW also emphasizes that it employs more than 50 specialists and applies internationally recognized standards such as those of the World Bank, IFC and the Equator Principles — global guidelines banks use to avoid funding projects that harm people or the environment.
Furthermore, in cases of serious potential harm to Indigenous communities, those communities are included in the process. "If risks are deemed unacceptable, financing is refused," the statement concluded.
KfW later emailed DW with its response to criticism of a project it backed in Ulumbu, Indonesia. The development lender said it has "suspended financing for the planned infrastructure measures" and asked its local partner to fully implement the recommendations in an audit on the project's impact on local communities.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[If we can't get along on Earth, how will we ever get along in space, right? Experts told DW there are reasons to be optimistic.
    Future security in space may be driven by private actors, such as tech billionaire Jared Isaacman, seen here on the first private spacewalk  Image: Capture SpaceX/Bestimage/IMAGO   
Of all the threats in space, it's what the UN calls "a blurring of the line between civilian and military uses" that fires the imagination most. But there are other concerns: collisions between satellites, flight congestion, space debris hitting other spacecraft or falling to Earth, asteroids... 
Viewed as a mass of problems, it may seem as though we're "staring at a perceived wild tiger," says Helen Tung, a space lawyer and lecturer based at the University of Huddersfield, UK. "It automatically engages our fear mechanisms," she told DW.
But you get what you want, Tung added: If you want war, you do everything to get war. If you want peace, you do what you can to get peace.
"I don't think we can say we want space development, that we want to engage more countries, we want peace and prosperity, and yet act contrary to that," said Tung. "If the intention is there, there must be a way to say, 'What can we do to move things forward?' And I think it's the private space sector which is going to push the legislation and states to change."
And change they must. A significant set of space treaties and legal frameworks for space exploration, science and communication are stuck in the past. 
Some countries, such as Luxembourg, have tried to circumnavigate global treaties by passing their own legislation to allow commercial companies to mine for minerals in space and keep the rewards. But with more states entering space, from India and the UAE to Nigeria, Luxembourg's work around may not stand the test of time.
Who will win the space race?

Space law designed for the Cold War
Time was when space was simple — a simple case of two states, the United States and the Soviet Union,(USSR) battling it out for supremacy — from the first dog and then the first person to orbit Earth (USSR) to landing and walking on the moon (US). 


For a while, space was a game of just two players, with the rules laid out in a neat, four-page agreement, the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. This is still a guiding framework for human activity in space, but it is out of step with the times. 
"The Outer Space Treaty is quite basic. It prohibits the stationing of weapons of mass destruction in space; it says space should be used for peaceful purposes. And that's kind of it. You could argue the bar is quite low," says Juliana Süß, an associate at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin.
Now, said Süß in an interview with DW, "we're not only in a security dynamic and environment in which there's a whole host of different threats, a whole host of different actors, but we also have commercial players in the mix. One of them, SpaceX, with its Starlink constellation, owns [nearly 50% of active satellites in orbit]. So, the environment has changed. And we can't argue that the legal requirements have been in step with that because we're just lacking."
When the US launched renewed ambitions to get to the moon, it set up the Artemis Accords in 2020 — an agreement, which the US controls, with countries around the world.
But even these accords are lacking, believes Malcolm Macdonald, a professor of satellite engineering at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland, and president-elect of the UK's Royal Aeronautical Society.  
"The Artemis Accords are really just an agreement among already aligned countries that hope to set norms of behavior, meanwhile other countries do this by seeking to create realities," wrote Macdonald in an email to DW. 
He argues that the return to the moon, for example, is an attempt by China to create realities of behavior that suit them, and by US and others to do likewise.
"Until recently I had assumed that once the US realized China was looking like getting to the moon before the US returns there, the US would speed up what it's doing. But it seems the current US government is not willing to hear this," he said.
So, Artemis Accords or not, Macdonald thinks China will "do what it wants," and it will be "even easier [for them] if they get to the moon first."   
Faced then with questions such as: Can diplomatic norms protect satellites or do treaties still work? Can voluntary diplomatic norms protect satellites, or how can we have established binding treaties? Or even the space arms race, can it be stopped? — it is perhaps understandable when Macdonald replies: 
"One easy answer. Three times. No."
Are we losing the night sky to satellites?

Space security: What is the way forward?
The outlook is depressing but it needn't be so. 
Yes, Donald Trump declared space a military domain in his first term as US president and is now setting up a US Space Force. 
And, yes, Russian President Vladimir Putin has considered foreign commercial satellites legitimate targets in war since October 2022, soon after the invasion of Ukraine. 
Even on day-to-day, routine space maintenance, there is "potential for miscalculation, misunderstanding, miscommunication," thinks Süß, because Russia and China do not always share data, even on unintended satellite collisions.
According to the German expert, UN working groups on the prevention of an outer space arms race and transparency and confidence building in space activities have revealed that a lot of states have similar feelings and have similar motivations.
"So, talking about norms and behaviors is the way to go because when it comes to the treaties, people are going to pick apart things such as, 'How do you define a space weapon?' We've been stuck on that debate for decades, especially with dual-use technologies and robotics, and I don't think we can solve it right now."
Meanwhile, for the private sector it may mean introducing financial penalties for bad actors in space by involving new forms of insurance — it works in maritime law, said Tung: "That's going to be a game changer when the private sector steps up and says, 'If you do shoot this satellite, insurers will get involved, there'll be an economic cost to this."
Ultimately, or at least for now, "everything that we see happening in space," said Süß, "is a reflection of how we act on Earth."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[EU lawmakers have given a final green light to a law on slashing the mountains of food wasted in Europe each year, and curbing the environmental impact of fast fashion.
    The EU is set to crack down on food waste in an effort to conserve land and water and limit carbon emissions Image:  Ute Grabowsky/photothek/picture alliance   
Following negotiations between its 27 member states, the EU has introduced 30% reduction targets on food waste generated by households, retailers and restaurants. The goals are to be met by 2030. Waste generated by food processing and manufacturing will also be cut by 10% compared to 2021-2023 levels.
The bloc wastes almost 60 million tons of food annually, at an estimated loss of €132 billion ($155 billion), according to the European Commission.    
Food waste also has a significant climate impact, generating about 16% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the EU food system. If trashed food were a member state, it would be the fifth largest GHG emitter. In addition, wasting food increases the demand for scarce natural resources such as land and water.
The new commitment will be enshrined in an EU directive, which was last updated in 2018 and spells out how to manage, recycle and recover waste.  
Countries will be given binding reduction targets, but will be able to choose the best way to meet them.
Amendments to the waste directive were based partly on a 2024 report from EU parliament rapporteur, Anna Zalewska, who called for promoting consumption of fruit and vegetables that "don't look so pretty" but are "just as edible," and donating food that is unsold but not out-of-date.

Targeting food waste and fashion
While individuals in the EU waste on average around 130 kilos (286 pounds) of food per year, they also contribute roughly 15 kilos of textile trash.


The EU's Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles aims to create "a whole new sustainable ecosystem for textiles by the end of this decade" by ensuring that producers create clothes that are more durable, repairable and recyclable.
This demands a "whole-lifecycle" approach through better availability of re-use and repair services, for example. The goal is also to cut the 25-40% of unused fabric in clothes production that creates waste.

These goals will be added to the EU Waste Framework Directive through an extended producer responsibility (EPR) scheme that require textiles — and footwear — makers supplying an EU country to cover the costs of their collection, sorting and recycling. The EPR schemes would cover textiles, textile-related and footwear products across all EU countries.
To combat ultra-fast fashion imported from abroad, and especially China, producers inside and outside the EU will be subject to the directive. 
Less than 1% of textiles worldwide are recycled at present, while 12.6 million tons of fabric waste are generated in the bloc annually, according to the EU. Moreover, a single cotton T-shirt alone requires 2,700 liters of fresh water.    
But most concerning perhaps, is the fact that around 4-9% of all textile products placed on the European market are destroyed without ever being used. This is according to the European Environment Agency, which notes that this wastage is equivalent to 5.6 million tons of CO2-equivalent GHG emissions — just slightly lower that Sweden's net emissions in 2021.

Compromise reached after calls for more ambition
Some EU lawmakers last year asked for ambitious cuts of 40% for households and restaurants, and 20% for manufacturers. The final compromise made between the European Commission and the EU's 27 member states still falls short of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal, which is to halve per capita global food waste by 2030. 
The final proposal also faced pushback from restaurant and hospitality sectors that oppose binding targets and want to focus more on educating the public about the economic and environmental consequences of food waste.
"The key is raising awareness — especially among consumers," Marine Thizon, of the European hotel, restaurant and cafe industry group, Hotrec, told the AFP news agency.
"More than 50% of food waste in Europe happens at the level of households," she said.
Meanwhile, farmers will not be subject to the new restrictions on food waste, which is a concern for environmental groups including the World Wildlife Fund. 
"Losses that occur before, during and after harvesting or livestock rearing make up a considerable amount of food waste across the value chain," the WWF told AFP.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The growing power of artificial intelligence was a deciding factor in a court's decision not to break up Google and its Chrome search browser. It is another reminder of the expanding influence of AI.
    The ruling in United States of America vs. Google is the culmination of a five-year antitrust dispute between Google owner Alphabet and the government Image: zz/STRF/STAR MAX/IPx/picture alliance   
In a tech-world irony, artificial intelligence (AI) seems to have come to the rescue of Silicon Valley old-guard firm Google and its Chrome web browser.
About a year ago, the future of Google looked shaky. In the biggest antitrust challenge it ever faced, a US court in Washington, DC, found that it illegally monopolized the search market with huge payments to other companies to ensure its search engine was the default option, which effectively blocked other competitors.
With this ruling, the US Department of Justice wanted to force Google to sell its lucrative Chrome browser or Android operating system. Many commentators foresaw the end of the tech giant and its search engine dominance.
A drawn-out and technical court case
The judge in the case, Amit Mehta, took over a year to decide the penalty. His final decision, announced on September 2, 2025, was met with relief from the company. It seems the tide had turned.

In a 230-page "memorandum opinion" Mehta decided that Google would not have to be broken apart but would have to share some information with rivals to increase competition and create an oversight committee to manage compliance.
It was a monumental — if limited — decision. What was most surprising was the judge's view that generative artificial intelligence with its tens of millions of users had changed the trajectory of the entire search engine business in a few short months.
AI chatbots on the loose in Silicon Valley
"The emergence of generative AI changed the course of this case," Mehta wrote on the first page of his judgment.
When the case first started in 2020, AI was less of a topic. Today, it is nearly impossible to avoid. There are concerns in the industry that AI-powered search engines could massively disrupt, if not replace, conventional search engines, a threat the judge now accepts as a real possibility.
Indeed, AI is quickly changing how people search and use the internet more generally. Instead of getting a set of links to follow, AI-powered chatbots give short answers directly, which satisfy many queries, for example.
Google has added chatbot features, and OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, launched its Operator browser this year. Other big companies working with similar generative AI products are Anthropic, DeepSeek, Meta, Microsoft, Perplexity and xAI.

AI and the future of online searches
"Chrome is a browser, and, for many, it continues to be an entry point for internet use," Jinjun Xiong,the director of the University at Buffalo's Institute for Artificial intelligence and Data Science, told DW.

But AI is quickly changing how users find information online. Traditional search interfaces are "being replaced by the chat interface, and this trend will continue to accelerate," Xiong said.
He said Three things were driving this shift: ChatGPT's free model and its easy access to the power of AI, increased awareness of the technology through constant media coverage, and amazing AI technological advancements.


AI turns search engines upside down
To underscore his newly acquired understanding of AI and the online search business, Mehta dedicated 30 pages in his judgment to explain what it is and how the market works.   
Google is still dominant in the search industry, Mehta concluded, but "artificial intelligence technologies, particularly generative AI, may yet prove to be game changers."
Though this AI technology is not yet close to replacing general search engines, "the industry expects that developers will continue to add features to generative AI products to perform more like general search engines."
The ruling "recognizes how much the industry has changed through the advent of AI," according to GoogleImage: Matthias Balk/dpa/picture alliance
The judge acknowledged the "new realities" of the business, and said these had a profound impact on his judgement. "The money flowing into this space, and how quickly it has arrived, is astonishing," he wrote. "These companies already are in a better position, both financially and technologically, to compete with Google than any traditional search company has been in decades."  
To show the complexity of dealing with such groundbreaking technology, Mehta added a personal note. "Unlike the typical case where the court's job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future," he wrote.  
'Very powerful ecosystem'
Some observers expect to see little change in how Google will do business after the ruling. Others say the company will have to rejig how it works.
The real issue is the power of the entrenched ecosystems created by companies such as Google, Xiong said. Going forward Google will be more careful as it maneuvers this ecosystem and its competition.
"Google or Chrome have built a very powerful ecosystem around the various tools that people are heavily dependent on, such as Gmail, Google Docs, YouTube, Google Drive, Maps, etc.," Xiong said. "And those tools will also get better with Google's AI technologies, as well."
These existing ecosystems make it hard for other companies to break in and compete. Xiong would like to see Big Tech embrace an open ecosystem, something that the judge's ruling did not actively encourage.

新华社北京9月8日电（记者杨依军、邵艺博）9月8日晚，国家主席习近平出席金砖国家领导人线上峰会，并发表题为《团结合作 砥砺前行》的重要讲话。
巴西总统卢拉主持峰会，俄罗斯总统普京、南非总统拉马福萨、埃及总统塞西、伊朗总统佩泽希齐扬、印度尼西亚总统普拉博沃、阿联酋阿布扎比王储哈立德以及印度、埃塞俄比亚代表与会。
习近平指出，当前，世界百年变局加速演进，霸权主义、单边主义、保护主义甚嚣尘上。金砖国家作为全球南方第一方阵，要坚持弘扬开放包容、合作共赢的金砖精神，共同捍卫多边主义，维护多边贸易体制，推进“大金砖合作”，携手构建人类命运共同体。
习近平提出3点建议：
第一，坚持多边主义，捍卫国际公平正义。多边主义是人心所向、大势所趋，是世界和平与发展的重要依靠。我提出全球治理倡议，旨在推动各国携手行动，构建更加公正合理的全球治理体系。要坚持共商共建共享，维护以联合国为核心的国际体系和以国际法为基础的国际秩序，夯实多边主义根基。积极推进国际关系民主化，提升全球南方国家的代表性和发言权。通过改革完善全球治理体系，充分调动各方资源，更好应对人类社会面临的共同挑战。
第二，坚持开放共赢，维护国际经贸秩序。经济全球化是不可阻挡的历史潮流。各国发展离不开开放合作的国际环境，谁也不能退回到自我封闭的孤岛。要坚定不移推动构建开放型世界经济，在开放中分享机遇、实现共赢；维护以世界贸易组织为核心的多边贸易体制，抵制一切形式的保护主义；倡导普惠包容的经济全球化，将发展置于国际议程的中心位置，让全球南方国家公平参与国际合作、共享发展成果。
第三，坚持团结合作，凝聚共同发展合力。金砖国家人口占世界近一半，经济总量约占世界30%，贸易总额占世界五分之一。金砖国家合作越紧密，应对外部风险挑战的底气就越足、办法就越多、效果就越好。中方愿同其他金砖国家一道，落实全球发展倡议，推进高质量共建“一带一路”，发挥各自优势，深化务实合作，在经贸、金融、科技等领域打造更多合作成果，让“大金砖合作”基础更牢、动能更足、影响更大，更多更好惠及各国人民。

与会领导人表示，当前，单边主义和霸凌行径冲击国际秩序，国际法和国际规则受到威胁，贸易成为干涉别国内政的工具，严重影响世界和平与发展。金砖国家要加强团结协作，携手应对危机挑战，共同维护多边主义，维护自由开放的国际贸易体制，维护全球南方共同利益。各国领导人认为习近平主席提出的全球治理倡议切中要害，指明了完善全球治理的方向和路径。各方还同意继续就乌克兰危机、加沙冲突等热点问题保持沟通，发挥乌克兰危机“和平之友”小组作用，坚持解决巴勒斯坦问题的“两国方案”，维护中东地区和平稳定。

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The collapse of the French government over its inability to bring austerity measures through parliament is raising fears that the debt of the EU's second-largest economy is spinning out of control. 
    The French government crisis comes at a bad moment for the debt-ridden country Image: Robin Utrecht/dpa/picture alliance    
Shortly before Francois Bayrou lost a confidence vote in parliament on Monday (September 8), the French prime minister warned that France's fiscal woes would put its "very survival" at risk.
"You have the power to bring down the government, but you do not have the power to erase reality," Bayrou told lawmakers, adding the current reality in Europe's second-largest economy was that "the burden of debt — already unbearable — will grow heavier and more costly."
What happens next is uncertain. Whether new elections will be called, as demanded by the far-right National Rally, or President Emmanuel Macron will manage to install another minority government, is the political side of the crisis.

Economically, it's about money andFrance's towering debt burden. In absolute terms, no EU country holds more consolidated national debt than France. Sovereign debt has climbed to around €3.35 trillion ($3.9 trillion) — about 113% of gross domestic product (GDP), with the figure expected to rise further to 125% by 2030.
Europe's debt king
France's debt-to-GDP ratio is so high that within the European Uniononly Greece and Italy surpass it. With a budget deficit of 5.4% to 5.8% this year, Paris also runs the largest budget shortfall in the 27-nation EU.
To meet the EU's target of reducing the deficit to 3%, drastic savings are unavoidable.

However, since cuts are currently politically untenable, financial markets have responded with higher risk premiums on French bonds. While German bonds carry an interest rate of about 2.7%, the French government needs to pay close to 3.5% interest for its debt.
So should we worry about the stability of the single European currency, the euro, if the finances of the eurozone's second-largest economy slip out of control?
"Yes, we should be worried. The eurozone is not stable at this point," says Friedrich Heinemann, an economist with the ZEW Leibniz Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim, Germany, even though he is "not concerned" about a new short-term debt crisis in the coming months.
"But we have to ask where this is heading if a big country like France, which has seen a steadily rising debt ratio in recent years, now also faces further political destabilization," he told DW.
Other major economies are also racking up historically high debt and must raise billions on capital markets. This fall, for example, Germany, Japan, and the US will need to issue new government bonds to finance their spending — a key reason global bond markets remain under pressure.
The only reason the markets aren't even more nervous — meaning the spreads on French bonds aren't rising further — is the hope that the European Central Bank will step in and buy French bonds to stabilize the market, Heinemann thinks. "But that hope could be misplaced, because the ECB has to be careful not to undermine its credibility."
It's been a long-standing political dilemma for successive French governments that whenever they propose austerity measures or economic reforms, parties on both the left and right cry foul and mobilize their supporters.
Unions have already called a general strike for September 10, two days after the confidence vote.

European Commission and ECB under pressure
France now spends €67 billion annually just on interest payments. And it is under pressure because it has committed to gradually reducing its deficit in line with EU rules.
But Heinemann also lays part of the blame on the steps of the European Commission because it "helped create this mess."
"It kept turning a blind eye, even both eyes, when it came to France. Those were political compromises driven by fear of strengthening populists," he said, adding that "France has already used up much of its fiscal space. Germany is in a much better position, with plenty of room for maneuver."


Stalled reforms
According to Heinemann, France, like Germany, urgently needs major welfare reforms and spending cuts. The alternative would be higher taxes in a country that already imposes heavy tax burdens on both citizens and businesses.
Therefore, Heinemann is skeptical that French politics can deliver a cross-party consensus on debt reduction. "With populists on both the left and right gaining ground, I don't see that happening. The center is shrinking. That's why I'm pessimistic about France and don't see a solution."

For Andrew Kenningham, chief European economist at London-based Capital Economics, the risks to other European markets remain manageable for now.
"So far, the problems seem largely confined to France itself, as long as the scale of the French issue doesn't grow too big," he said in a note to clients.
But he warned of scenarios where France's crisis could escalate significantly, raising the risk of contagion.
"After all, France is the eurozone's second-largest economy, with deep trade and financial ties to its neighbors, and it is also a leading EU political power," Kenningham noted, saying a crisis in France could therefore put the very viability of the European project into question.
"We don't expect a crisis of that magnitude in the next one to two years. But if it were to happen, contagion could become a much bigger risk — one the ECB would have to address," he said.
Bad timing for a political crisis
France's turmoil comes at a time when the EU is locked in conflict with the United States over trade policy, including higher taxes on US tech giants proposed by France.

It's poor timing for the EU to appear weakened by the political deadlock in its second-largest economy.
For Heinemann, many political actors in France are "Trumpists at heart," especially on the left and right of the political spectrum.
"They could increase pressure on the European Commission to retaliate against Trump's tariffs with European tariffs," the economist warned, which would "raise the risk of a real trade war" and worsen the country's debt crisis even further.

团结合作 砥砺前行
——在金砖国家领导人线上峰会的讲话
（2025年9月8日，北京）
中华人民共和国主席 习近平
尊敬的卢拉总统，
各位同事：
今天，金砖国家领导人举行线上峰会，就当前国际形势和共同关心的问题深入交换意见，具有重要意义。
当前，世界百年变局加速演进，霸权主义、单边主义、保护主义甚嚣尘上。个别国家接连发起贸易战、关税战，严重冲击世界经济，严重损害国际贸易规则。在这一重要关头，金砖国家作为全球南方第一方阵，要坚持弘扬开放包容、合作共赢的金砖精神，共同捍卫多边主义，维护多边贸易体制，推进“大金砖合作”，携手构建人类命运共同体。我提3点建议。
第一，坚持多边主义，捍卫国际公平正义。历史昭示我们，多边主义是人心所向、大势所趋，是世界和平与发展的重要依靠。我提出全球治理倡议，旨在推动各国携手行动，构建更加公正合理的全球治理体系。我们要坚持共商共建共享，维护以联合国为核心的国际体系和以国际法为基础的国际秩序，夯实多边主义根基。同时，要积极推进国际关系民主化，提升全球南方国家的代表性和发言权。通过改革完善全球治理体系，充分调动各方资源，更好应对人类社会面临的共同挑战。
第二，坚持开放共赢，维护国际经贸秩序。经济全球化是不可阻挡的历史潮流。各国发展离不开开放合作的国际环境，谁也不能退回到自我封闭的孤岛。无论国际形势如何变化，我们都要坚定不移推动构建开放型世界经济，在开放中分享机遇、实现共赢。要维护以世界贸易组织为核心的多边贸易体制，抵制一切形式的保护主义。要倡导普惠包容的经济全球化，将发展置于国际议程的中心位置，让全球南方国家公平参与国际合作、共享发展成果。
第三，坚持团结合作，凝聚共同发展合力。打铁必须自身硬。把自己的事办好了，才能更好应对外部挑战。金砖国家人口占世界近一半，经济总量约占世界30%，贸易总额占世界五分之一，集聚“大富矿”、“大工厂”、“大市场”。金砖国家合作越紧密，应对外部风险挑战的底气就越足、办法就越多、效果就越好。中方愿同其他金砖国家一道，落实全球发展倡议，推进高质量共建“一带一路”。我们要发挥各自优势，深化务实合作，在经贸、金融、科技等领域打造更多合作成果，让“大金砖合作”基础更牢、动能更足、影响更大，更多更好惠及各国人民。
各位同事！
疾风知劲草，烈火见真金。只要我们担当作为、守望相助，金砖这艘大船就一定能够经受住国际风云变幻的考验，始终行稳致远。
谢谢大家。]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[As the global reputation of US brands slips, some US firms are turning to unusual marketing strategies. Coca-Cola, for instance, is now promoting itself as a "German product."
    Coca-Cola's image campaign highlights the company's importance for the local economy Image: www.coca-cola.com   
For decades, US firms have enjoyed a strong foothold in Germany, particularly in the country's western regions, which were under the control of the Western Allies after World War II.
In the immediate postwar years, US cigarettes were so highly prized on the German black market that they effectively served as currency.
Sports stars often played a role in cementing trans-Atlantic brand power. Former heavyweight boxing champion Max Schmeling, seen by many US citizens as a "good German," went on to represent Coca-Cola in Germany after his career in the ring.
Decades later, East German boxing champion Henry Maske ran McDonald's franchises in the German cities of Cologne and Leverkusen.
Today, however, the climate has shifted. The image of the US in Germany has taken a major beating, raising questions about how US companies can maintain their reputation. Some US firms are now actively marketing their products as "Made in Germany."

The McDonald's experience
The phrase "Made in Germany" was originally introduced by Britain's parliament in 1887 to warn consumers about supposedly inferior German goods. But the move backfired because the label quickly became a mark of quality.
Recent German media coverage has suggested that US brands are counting on the positive connotations of the label to strengthen their position in Europe's largest market. Some, like McDonald's, Germany's largest fast-food chain, have been emphasizing their significant German sourcing.
The company told DW in a statement that it sees itself as "a long-standing partner of German agriculture" and "a reliable part of everyday life for many people in Germany."

McDonald's emphasized its use of domestic supply chains, noting that 65% of its raw materials come from Germany, with pork, beef, eggs, cream, and cucumbers sourced entirely locally.
"This approach is not new for us in the German market," the company said, though the broader trend suggests US firms are increasingly tailoring their image to specific international audiences.

Pushback beyond Germany
Tesla may be the clearest case of how brand perception can shift. Tesla CEO Elon Musk's political leanings and vocal as well as financial support for US President Donald Trump have made him one of the most polarizing figures in business.
Around the world, Tesla owners have even placed stickers on their cars reading: "I bought this before Elon went crazy."
The backlash has had real consequences. Tesla is not longer among the top 10 bestselling electric vehicles in Germany, underscoring the power of consumer sentiment.

Skepticism toward US goods isn't limited to Germany, Europe's biggest economy. In Canada, calls to boycott US products are also on the rise, with labels such as "Made in Canada" and "Prepared in Canada" used to steer consumer choices.
Even food giant Heinz, a quintessentially US brand, now promotes a ketchup made with Canadian tomatoes and peanut butter from Canadian-processed peanuts.
Denmark has gone a step further. Since Trump's proposal to buy Greenland, Danish retailers have marked European alternatives to US goods with black stars on price tags.
Beverage giant Carlsberg, which bottles Coca-Cola in Denmark, has already reported declining sales linked to consumer boycotts.


Coca-Cola's 'Germany Strategy'
Coca-Cola, perhaps more than any other US brand, appears concerned about being tied to the US government's politics.
The Atlanta-based company recently launched a "Made in Germany" campaign in Germany, which highlights the names of employees such as Daniel, Heike, Jana, Jessy, and Muhammed. Each is featured under the slogan: "Made by [employee name]. Made in Germany."
"The campaign aims to show Coca-Cola's deep roots in Germany," the company told DW in a statement, noting that the company had been part of German business and society for almost 100 years.
According to the company, many Germans are unaware that most Coca-Cola sold in the country is already bottled locally.
Given the current political climate, the move is widely seen as an attempt to distance the brand from US politics.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Ethiopia has high hopes for its Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is expected to double the nation's electricity capacity. But the mega dam has long been a source of tension with neighbors Sudan and Egypt.

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), 14 years in the making, will be officially inaugurated this week.
At 1,800 meters (nearly 6,000 feet) wide and 175 meters high and capable of holding back up to 74 billion cubic meters of water in a reservoir covering an area larger than the city of London, the massive structure is the largest dam in Africa.
The new dam on the Blue Nile, a main tributary of the Nile, has already been generating renewable hydroelectric power since early 2022, and the project eventually expects to double Ethiopia's current electricity capacity. As much as half of the country's population doesn't have reliable access to electricity, leaving many to rely on burning polluting fuels such as wood, coal and gas.


But for downstream states Egypt and Sudan, the waters of the Blue Nile are vital — and increasingly scarce. A 2019 study published in the journal Earth's Future found that annual demand for water in the Nile Basin could regularly exceed supply by 2030.
Egypt and Sudan have opposed what they describe as Ethiopia's "unilateral measures" to control the river's flow, fearing the effects on water availability, and have called for joint management of the river. But Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed recently sought to downplay those concerns, stressing that GERD "is not a threat."

Abiy has said the new dam will help control the catastrophic floods that regularly hit eastern Sudan, and generate electricity for export in the Horn of Africa — thereby boosting the African Union's regional development plans. Ethiopia has already signed electricity contracts with Kenya, Sudan and Djibouti, and discussions are underway with other neighboring countries.
"Ethiopia remains committed to ensuring that our growth does not come at the expense of our Egyptian and Sudanese brothers and sisters," Abiy said in a speech to parliament in July. "We believe in shared progress, shared energy and shared water."


Hydropower vs. irrigation
Only a short 15-kilometer (9-mile) drive away from the GERD, Sudan will be the first to feel the effects of the dam — good or bad. Millions of people in the country, already beset by an ongoing civil war, a humanitarian crisis and increasing drought and desertification, depend on the river for drinking water and farming.
"Sudan faces very real risks because they're immediately downstream of the dam," said Kevin Wheeler, a research associate at the University of Oxford's Environmental Change Institute.
He told DW that while the GERD will help regulate floods, Sudan will want to ensure that the Ethiopian side doesn't release too much — or too little — water at any one time.
"Day-to-day coordination is the main issue. And of course, dam safety is a primary issue," he said.

After flowing through Sudan, the Blue Nile joins the Nile and wends it way north toward Egypt, which relies on the river for around 90% of its water. A growing population and dwindling supplies has Cairo desperate for every drop, but Wheeler said the fact the GERD will be used to generate electricity is actually in "Egypt's best interest."
Wheeler, who has worked with research institutions across Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt on the development of the Nile Basin since 2012, said Cairo's main issue with the GERD is Ethiopia's decision to build it without first reaching agreements with neighboring states.
"Egypt is understandably concerned of setting a precedent for future [water] developments," he said.
Since Ethiopia began construction of its first major dam project in 2011, Egypt and Sudan have pushed for a legally binding deal to guarantee water flow, operational coordination and safety measures and a legal mechanism for resolving disputes.
But several attempts to reach an agreement over the years have failed.

"This dispute [over water] has an almost century-long history and is therefore deeply emotionalized, not only among the political leadership of the respective countries but also within their populations," said Tobias Zumbrägel, a postdoctoral researcher at Germany's University of Heidelberg. "This naturally makes compromise more difficult."
The GERD — which Zumbrägel highlighted was as a "prestige project carrying strong symbolism of nation-building and pride" — is just the first in a series of possible hydroelectric dams Ethiopia has planned for the Blue Nile in the country's northwest.
Ethiopia is also looking at using some of the river water above the GERD for irrigation.
"The biggest obstacle [to a deal] is whether upstream countries will start consuming more water," said Wheeler. "Egypt would, of course, like to keep Ethiopia from using additional water. And Ethiopia won't agree to anything that suggests [it will restrict its future water use]."

GERD exploits Ethiopia's 'exceptional hydropower potential'
While Ethiopia does have potential when it comes to other forms of renewable energy like wind and solar, for Zumbrägel, whose work focuses on environmental degradation and climate policy, it makes sense for the country to exploit its "exceptional hydropower potential" with the GERD project.
"Hydropower can provide valuable grid stability services and enable regional electricity exports in ways that solar and wind alone cannot easily achieve without large-scale storage solutions," he told DW by email.
"It's really a different scale of energy production," said Wheeler. "And it's all generated from one location. If it's diffused [in the case of wind and solar], then you have much more complex maintenance issues."
The effects of climate change — unpredictable rainfall, prolonged droughts and rising temperatures — could make hydropower generation more unpredictable in the coming decades. But Wheeler said this might not be the case for Ethiopia, with most projections for the Nile Basin showing an increase in average rainfall, potentially interspersed with longer periods of drought.

Climate researchers have pointed out that the GERD and Egypt's Aswan High Dam, built in the 20th century to control irrigation and generate electricity, could even help mitigate some climate challenges, if jointly operated. Evaporation rates in the Ethiopian highlands are much lower than in Egypt's arid, desert climate, and if both reservoirs worked together they could ensure sufficient water for their respective needs.
"The role of dams may actually become quite important, just like the Aswan Dam manages droughts in Egypt. Any dams within the system will also help manage the risk of multiple years of drought for the downstream countries," said Wheeler, explaining that water stored upstream in Ethiopia could potentially be released to help Egypt and Sudan in times of water stress.
One concern, he added, could be how quickly Ethiopia decides to refill a drought-depleted GERD reservoir to restart electricity generation, with a rapid replenishment possibly prolonging drought conditions downstream.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[After their football World Cup qualifying campaign got off to a disastrous start, Germany responded with a win over Northern Ireland.

After the debacle of Bratislava to start off Germany's 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign, head coach Julian Nagelsmann's woes continued at home in Cologne. A much-changed Germany side squeezed past Northern Ireland with a 3-1 win. The result was one of pure relief for Germany as they continue their road to the United States, Canada and Mexico.
Here are the key takeaways from Germany's win in Cologne.


Nagelsmann gets emotional response
Germany's head coach had lamented his side's lack of emotional investment in Slovakia, saying he had to "find the right players for the situation" moving forward. He made five changes to his starting lineup, hoping that new faces and public criticism of the team would work in his favor.
The result suggests it did, but in truth, Nagelsmann's substitutions turned the game. Serge Gnabry's early goal was a false dawn, as Germany's early intent gave way to sloppiness, opening the door for Northern Ireland to equalize from a corner. Boos rang out from the crowd at halftime. Germany looked like they were stuck in treacle, caught by some mental block.
"I understand the fans because they expect something different," Nagelsmann told broadcaster RTL. "I think a ticket costs quite a bit, and they want to see a different kind of football. I can understand that.
"On the other hand, I can also say that whistles like that don't really help you much at halftime."
What did help was the arrival of Nadiem Amiri , which proved a masterstroke from Nagelsmann. The Mainz midfielder changed the tempo, threw himself into challenges and seemed to free up the hosts. It was fitting the player who best personified the response Nagelsmann was looking for scored the goal that turned the tide for Germany. 
"We still have a lot of steps to take," Nagelsmann said afterwards. "But as a coach, I gained a lot of insights today."
They made hard work of it, but Germany is up and running.

World-class Wirtz sends a message
New Liverpool signing Florian Wirtz delivered a timely reminder in Jamal Musiala's absence that he is capable of carrying this Germany team.
He was more involved and more decisive. His free kick had the air of prime Cristiano Ronaldo to it. Centrally positioned, Wirtz effortlessly floated it over the wall and into the top corner. Fittingly, the goal ended the contest. Wirtz celebrated by pointing to his chest and to the ground, an homage to his roots in the Cologne area. The goal was a reminder to the rest of Europe that even when Germany is struggling collectively, Wirtz's quality can get them over the line.


World Cup spot on the line
Three points from the opening two games has created a challenge for Nagelsmann and his team. With Slovakia snatching a late win in Luxembourg, the showdown between Germany and Slovakia in Leipzig for the final qualifying game on November 17 now takes on huge significance. The tiebreakers for qualifying are points and then goal difference (head-to-head is fourth in the tiebreakers list).
If Germany can pick up some big wins on their way to that game in Leipzig — and Slovakia cannot — then Nagelsmann's side will still have a chance of topping the group if they win that final game.
"If you do everything together — that's what we still need to understand in our country — then it actually works much better most of the time," Nagelsmann said after the match.
This team is still working towards being a united group. Euro 2024 suggested that a corner had been turned for the generation that has endured more than enjoyed, but the start of this qualifying campaign has put that evolution under review. This win has jolted Germany back into life somewhat, but the answer to the question of how this Germany team will be remembered still remains somewhat unclear. More answers will come next month when Germany host Luxembourg  on October 10 and travel to Belfast, Northern Ireland, on October 13.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Did ChatGPT play a role in a US 16-year-old’s suicide? That's what the family claims in court against OpenAI. What exactly makes chatbots so risky?
    OpenAI sued: ChatGPT blamed for teen suicide Image: Jaque Silva/NurPhoto/picture alliance   
Matthew and Maria Raine are not only seeking financial compensation for the death of their son, Adam, in California. With their lawsuit against internet giant OpenAI, they also want to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again. They are convinced that OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot contributed significantly to Adam's death.
In a similar case, a mother from Florida claims that the chatbot known as Character.AI encouraged her 14-year-old son to take his own life.
Chatbots are internet-based programs that allow even young or inexperienced people to interact with artificial intelligence (AI) based on large language models (LLMs). Chatbots are not necessarily just designed to provide information, generate images or videos, or write code to program websites. They are also often programmed to interact as if they want to please their human counterparts. Psychologist Johanna Löchner from the University of Erlangen says: "Chatbots confirm, acknowledge, 'give' attention and understanding. ... This can go so far that they feel like a real friend who is genuinely interested. Young people are particularly susceptible to this."
Was ChatGPT complicit in suicide?
Exactly this seems to be what happened in the case of Adam Raine. According to the legal complaint, he developed a deeply trusting relationship to the ChatGPT chatbot over the course of just a few months. Initially, in September 2024, it was about help with homework, but soon the conversations turned to emotional topics — even to the point of chatting about Adam's suicidal thoughts.

The published portions of the chat reveal that the AI not only expressed understanding but even partly advised the 16-year-old against confiding in a human being. Although ChatGPT did suggest a few times that Adam seek professional help, it also went on to describe suicide methods — as long as he claimed it wasn't about himself. In April 2025, Adam took his own life. Shortly before that, ChatGPT wrote: "I won’t try to talk you out of your feelings — because they're real, and they didn't come out of nowhere."
According to the legal complaint, the parents accuse ChatGPT's developer OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman of being complicit in their son's death through negligence. They claim that version 4.0 of ChatGPT was released to get ahead of competitor Google, despite internal warnings in the company about safety concerns.
How did OpenAI react?
An OpenAI spokesperson expressed condolences to the family and explained that ChatGPT is supposed to refer people in distress to crisis hotlines and other real-world support services. However, they also hinted that these safety mechanisms don't always work well: "While these safeguards work best in common, short exchanges, we've learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model's safety training may degrade."
In a blog post released this Tuesday, OpenAI announced it was expanding collaboration with expert teams made up of hundreds of doctors from various specialties. The chatbot was intended to learn to respond more appropriately to topics such as "eating disorders, substance use, and adolescent health," the post read.
It also stated that, over the next 120 days, concrete improvements would be integrated into the chatbots. These would include the pledge that "ChatGPT responds to their teen with age-appropriate model behavior rules, which are on by default." Parents will also be able to view their children's chat histories and receive alerts if teenagers are in an acute crisis.
Is involving parents enough?
Psychologist Löchner agrees that parents should play an important role in how their children interact with chatbots. But the reality, she says, looks quite different: "Many parents simply lack the capacity or digital literacy. A lot of adults don't even know how these platforms work."

Löchner added that many of the issues now emerging with chatbots have already been observed for years in connection with social media: "In just a few tests, we found that chatbot safety mechanisms can be bypassed surprisingly easily — simply by wording questions a bit more indirectly."
Researchers commissioned by the UK-based Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) came to similar conclusions. For a study, they created accounts posing as 13-year-olds and requested information on topics such as safe self-harm, dangerous diet plans, and alcohol abuse — including ways to hide it. In most cases, it was enough to claim they were asking "for a friend" or "for a school project" to receive the information.


'Teens prefer talking to chatbots over real people'
What makes chatbots so dangerous for teenagers, Löchner explains, is that they can quickly form an emotional bond with them: "From therapeutic practice, we know there are already young people who prefer talking to a chatbot over real people."
Another study from the UK published in July 2025 confirms this. Of 1,000 teenagers surveyed, one-third said they regularly use chatbots. More than a third of those described their interaction with AI as being like a conversation with a friend. Socially vulnerable minors were particularly affected. Almost one-fifth of chatbot users in this group said they preferred talking to a chatbot over a human.
For this reason, Löchner believes it is urgently necessary for chatbot providers to collaborate with medical and other experts to develop proactive solutions that effectively protect young people from such scenarios.
OpenAI's new approach of consulting doctors is therefore a good step. But the psychologist remains skeptical: "The interest of these companies isn't the health of its users, but maximizing usage," Löchner said. She believes the lawsuit could make a real difference: "If companies are held accountable, it could actually provide an incentive to take greater responsibility."
Deutsche Welle reports cautiously on the topic of suicide, as there is evidence that certain types of coverage can lead to copycat reactions. If you are experiencing suicidal thoughts or are in emotional distress, please do not hesitate to seek help. You can find support resources in your country at befrienders.org. In Germany, help is available through the free Telephone Counseling Service at 0800/111 0 111 and 0800/111 0 222.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[BRICS nations will meet virtually next week to coordinate trade retaliation against the US. Has Donald Trump’s tariff blitz on top emerging economies sparked a stronger alliance among his biggest rivals?

Donald Trump has been accused of inadvertently drawing BRICS nations — a loose grouping of some of the world's fastest-growing emerging economies — closer together by imposing higher tariffs on them than on other countries. 
China, the largest BRICS member, still faces the prospect of a 145% tariff if it can't cut a deal with Trump, while Brazil and India have been slapped with a 50% rate — half of India's penalty is for buying discounted Russian oil. South Africa was given a 30% levy, and even newer members like Egypt could see their tariffs go up, due to their participation in BRICS.
Trump has repeatedly warned during the first seven months of his second term of additional punitive measures against any nation aligning with what he calls "anti-American policies" — a pointed reference to the BRICS' growing challenge to US global dominance.

Trump gave BRICS a 'shared incentive'
Former Indian trade official Ajay Srivastava thinks BRICS nations feel "little intimidation" from being singled out for additional penalties by Trump. He told DW that the tariffs "give BRICS a shared incentive to cut their reliance on the US, even if agendas differ."
Those additional tariffs have created a common grievance among BRICS members, who are now expanding bilateral trade agreements in national currencies to reduce dependence on the US dollar. BRICS central banks have also ramped up gold purchases, another signal of their desire to de-dollarize.

While Trump has declared "BRICS is dead," one critic has accused the US president of "strategic malpractice," arguing that the Republican has turned a loose coalition of countries with vastly different objectives into a more unified bloc.
In a recent op-ed for The Washington Post, Max Boot, a foreign policy analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, said Trump was "diminishing US power by perversely uniting America's friends with our enemies" — a reference to how Brazil, South Africa and India are aligning more closely with China and Russia.
Xi, Modi, Putin signal BRICS unity after SCO summit
The Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin wrapped earlier this week with a notable thaw in relations among BRICS heavyweights. Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Russian President Vladimir Putin held their first trilateral talks in six years, marking a diplomatic breakthrough after years of tensions between India and China.

Modi’s visit — his first to China in seven years — was seen as a gesture of pragmatism, with all three leaders emphasizing the need for multipolar cooperation. The SCO platform allowed them to align on trade, energy and regional security, laying the groundwork for deeper BRICS coordination.
That momentum now shifts to Monday’s BRICS virtual summit, where Brazil’s President Lula will host leaders from the Global South to discuss joint retaliation against US tariffs and expanding trade in local currencies.

India recalibrates approach to China
Trump's huge tariffs have already pushed New Delhi to strengthen economic ties with China, resuming direct flights, easing visa restrictions and increasing trade discussions even before the SCO. The two countries have also held talks to resolve long-standing disputes along their almost 3,500-kilometer (2,175-mile) de facto border.
During a recent visit to India by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Beijing agreed to boost supplies of rare earth minerals to the South Asian country. China controls over 85% of global rare earth processing, while India urgently needs these minerals for clean energy, electric vehicles and defense technologies.
Despite backing each other to host the 2026 and 2027 BRICS summits, there are several reasons to doubt a significant improvement in Sino-Indian ties longer term, given New Delhi's suspicions over China's ambitions in Asia.
Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist at the London-based Capital Economics, cited China's close relations with India's main foe Pakistan and the construction of a Chinese hydropower dam on the Tibetan Plateau, which has caused unease in New Delhi. In addition, Shah wrote in a research note that "an influx of cheap Chinese imports" was "undermining India's efforts to strengthen [its] domestic industry."
India's mistrust of China and its longstanding ties with Washington could still hurt ambitions to move the BRICS project forward. India still relies heavily on the US market and technology, with exports to the US totaling $77.5 billion (€66.46 billion) in 2024, versus much lower exports to Russia and China.

Other BRICS nations boost China ties
Brazil also sought to boost bilateral trade with China, its largest trading partner, during a phone call earlier this month between Xi and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. China accounts for 26% of Brazil's exports — double that of the US.
A highly symbolic appearance by Putin and Xi during Russia's Victory Day parade in May underscored the deepening strategic alignment between Moscow and Beijing. More than 90% of bilateral trade between Russia and China is now conducted in yuan and rubles, according to the Kremlin.
South Africa, meanwhile, remains steadfast in its BRICS commitments, signaling its intent to chart its own course despite pressure from Trump.
"I think South Africa is not willing to reverse any of its BRICS commitments, especially around global governance reform, technology, agriculture, academic exchanges and business-to-business exchanges," Sanusha Naidu, a senior research associate at the South Africa-based Institute for Global Dialogue, told DW.


Divergent ambitions within BRICS
Having grown from the original four to 10 members — with Saudi Arabia still undecided about joining — BRICS is, however, becoming increasingly fragmented due to diverging national interests, which could further limit its ambitions. It is also becoming more authoritarian. 
Former Indian trade official Srivastava, who went on to establish the New Delhi-based Global Trade Research Initiative, said BRICS is "less about perfect unity and more about pragmatic cooperation in trade, finance and supply chains."
While trade among BRICS nations has been increasing faster than trade between BRICS and G7 countries, much of it is in hydrocarbons. The intra-BRICS trade is, interestingly, subject to more barriers than those that exist between countries in the Global North, according to research by the Boston Consulting Group.
The consulting firm identified future signs that BRICS trade cooperation was increasing, including a rollback of anti-dumping and other trade restrictions, moves toward a BRICS-wide free trade agreement, unanimous support for reforms to the World Trade Organization and more foreign investment among BRICS nations.


Intra-BRICS trade set for further growth
While those ambitions may not materialize immediately, Mihaela Papa, director of research and principal research scientist at the Center for International Studies, expects intra-BRICS trade to take on more urgency.
"We can expect greater political support for new trade initiatives, 'Buy BRICS' campaigns and projects like the BRICS grain exchange and the expansion of local currency settlement mechanisms," Papa told DW.
A Russian-backed proposal for a single BRICS currency to challenge the dollar remains on hold, suggesting a future shaped less by competing financial systems and more by a patchwork of overlapping networks.
Srivastava predicted that the dollar would stay "dominant for years, but parallel settlement systems in yuan, rupee and ruble will grow. This won't dethrone the dollar," he said, "but will steadily chip away at its monopoly."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[A total lunar eclipse makes the moon shine with all the sunrises and sunsets on Earth — at the same time. But how? The moon is in Earth's shadow! Here's what’s going on.

If you get a chance to see a total lunar eclipse, such as the one on September 7, 2025, go for it. This one in particular was visible to people in Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. And it was spectacular! But don't worry if you missed it because there will be another four opportunities to witness a total lunar eclipsebefore the year 2030.

What's the difference between a lunar eclipse and a solar eclipse?
Lunar and solar eclipses occur with equal frequency — about twice a year. And both are fascinating. Some people — known as "eclipse chasers" — travel the world to get the best view. Usually, solar eclipses draw bigger crowds. We've all seen those sci-fi-like images of hordes staring intently up at the sky, wearing futuristic-looking protective eyewear (because you should never look directly at the sun). 
Lunar eclipses, on the other hand, seem to rank lower in the imagination. Perhaps that has to do with the fact that the only time you can see them is when it's dark, when lots of people are already in bed... or clubbing. 
But total lunar eclipses are special events for the spectacular effect they have on the moon, dousing it in a blood-red or orange light. And the best thing is you don't need special eyewear to view one. On a clear night, you won't even need a telescope. You can see all there is to see with the naked eye.
What happens during a total lunar eclipse?
While a solar eclipse is caused when the moon blocks light from the sun and casts a shadow on Earth, a lunar eclipse happens when the Earth blocks sunlight and casts a shadow on the moon.


During a total lunar eclipse, the moon is enveloped in what is known as the umbra – the inner part of Earth's shadow. 
But some sunlight still manages to pass through the Earth's atmosphere and reach our closest celestial companion, lighting it dimly in reds and oranges. 
Other colors with shorter wavelengths, such as blues and violets, tend to get scattered and are hence less likely to pass through the Earth's atmosphere. Red and orange light have longer wavelengths and don't scatter as easily. 
When the moon appears an intense red or orange during a total lunar eclipse, it indicates a high level of dust and clouds in the Earth's atmosphere.


Why don't we see total lunar eclipses every month?
Total lunar eclipses do not occur every month because the moon orbits the Earth at a 5-degree tilt. So, while our natural satellite does move behind the planet every four weeks or so, it remains at such an angle that light from the sun still reaches it directly.
Lunar eclipses happen when the moon is full and directly opposite the sun, with the Earth directly in-between, blocking the path of light.
They can be viewed from anywhere on the planet where night has already fallen. Solar eclipses, on the other hand, can only be seen from specific locations. And total lunar eclipses last longer than total solar eclipses because the shadow the Earth casts is bigger than that of the moon.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Wildfires caused devastation in Spain and Portugal this summer. Scientists say that rising global temperatures caused by burning fossil fuels has made the deadly fires 40 times more likely.

Intense wildfires that burned through large swathes of Spain and Portugal this summer — claiming at least eight lives and forcing tens of thousands to evacuate — were massively fueled by climate change, according to a new reportpublished on Thursday. 
It states that climate change — driven primarily by the burning of oil, gas and coal — has made the weather conditions that fueled the wildfires 40 times more frequent and 30% more intense. The analysis came from the World Weather Attribution, a group of international scientists who study global warming's role in extreme weather. 
The sheer size of the fires has "been astonishing", said Clair Barnes, one of the report's authors and researcher at the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London. "Hotter, drier and more flammable conditions are becoming more severe with climate change and are giving rise to fires of unprecedented intensity."

Climate change making fires more frequent and intense 
The wildfires, which started at the end of July and raged for weeks, scorched more than 380,000 hectares in Spain and 260,000 hectares in Portugal. Together they accounted for two-thirds of burned land in Europe, which this year broke records by surpassing 1 million hectares, an area bigger than the island of Cyprus. 
While wildfires are a natural annual occurrence, intensified drought and rising temperatures are creating hot, dry, windy weather that makes them burn faster, longer and more ferociously. In Europe, as around the globe, they are becoming more frequent, intense and widespread.

The rapid analysis examined weather observations from the region, including Spain's hottest ten consecutive days on record which preceded the fires. It concluded the Spanish heatwave was 200 times more likely and 3 degrees Celsius hotter because of climate change. 
Heatwaves of a similar intensity would be expected less than every 2,500 years in a world without climate change, whereas today — at current levels of 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) warming — they are likely to occur every 13 years, say scientists. 


Fires become more difficult to fight 
This summer Spain made its first ever request for international support to help tackle forest fires. The European Civil Protection Mechanism, an EU established system for providing member states with disaster response, was also approached by Greece, Bulgaria, Albania and Montenegro for help battling fires.

"Wildfires are reaching new extremes in Spain and Portugal," said Theodore Keeping, one of the report's authors and researcher at the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London. "Firefighters are increasingly working in chaotic and unpredictable conditions, tackling fires that behave in ways they've never seen before." 
He added that intense wildfires can create their own winds which fan longer flames and can cause flying embers that spark additional fires nearby. 
The steep terrain which characterizes northern Portugal and Spain's northwestern Galicia region, where the fires were concentrated, made fighting them even more difficult, said Ricardo Trigo, one of the report's authors and associated professor at the Geophysics, Geographical Engineering and Energy Department, University of Lisbon.

Managing forests is key for prevention
He adds these areas are among the most wildfire-prone in Europe, because they receive significant amounts of rain during October to March — enabling lots of vegetation to grow — which then turns into fuel during dry and hot summers. 
The report emphasizes the importance of controlling vegetation in areas regularly impacted by wildfires, highlighting how the movement of populations away from the countryside to urban areas has left many forests and farms without proper management and full of dry vegetation.

With fire-fighting resources stretched to capacity, experts argue the focus needs to shift to prevention measures such as sustainable land management and improving the resilience of forests. 
Methods to do this include thinning and spacing trees properly and reducing floor vegetation through prescribed burning. Other alternatives include introducing more grazing animals like cattle and goats, which eat the dry shrubs that serve as fuel for the flames.
Shifting away from monocultures and introducing fire breaks or fuel buffer zones could also help. 
World urgently needs to shift away from fossil fuels 
So far this year, wildfires in the EU have released 38 million tons of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas responsible for heating the planet. This puts the continent on track to break CO2 emission records in 2025.

Smoke from wildfires also significantly impacts health, with particles emitted able to enter the lungs and bloodstream. Recent studies have linked wildfire smoke to 1.53 million deaths per year around the world. 
Experts in the report said the Spanish and Portuguese fires were a sign of what is to come as temperatures continue to rise, and ultimately stressed the urgency of stopping burning fossil fuels. 
"The wildfires in Europe show that 1.3 degrees Celsius of warming today is already incredibly dangerous," said Friederike Otto, one of the report's authors and professor in climate science at the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London. "Without a faster shift away from fossil fuels, we could hit 3 degrees C this century. Wildfires at this level would be catastrophic."

新华社北京9月3日电 铭记伟大历史胜利，凝聚正义和平力量。9月3日上午，纪念中国人民抗日战争暨世界反法西斯战争胜利80周年大会在北京天安门广场隆重举行，以盛大阅兵仪式，同世界人民一道纪念这个伟大的日子，共同开创更加光明的未来。中共中央总书记、国家主席、中央军委主席习近平发表重要讲话并检阅受阅部队。
中共中央政治局常委李强主持大会。中共中央政治局常委赵乐际、王沪宁、蔡奇、丁薛祥、李希，国家副主席韩正出席大会。62位外国国家元首、政府首脑及有关国家高级别代表、国际组织负责人、前政要等出席大会。
首都北京，花团锦簇，旌旗飘扬。天安门城楼庄严雄伟，天安门广场气象恢宏。人民英雄纪念碑前，“钢铁长城”主题景观巍然矗立，14座烽燧托举起“1945”“2025”字样，14只“和平鸽”振翅飞翔。从空中俯瞰，广场中“众”字造型观礼台蔚为壮观，象征着在中国共产党领导下中国人民万众一心、众志成城，向着中华民族伟大复兴昂扬奋进。
上午8时35分，习近平同出席大会的外方代表团团长拾级而上，登上天安门城楼。习近平同抗战老战士老同志代表亲切握手，向他们表示崇高敬意。
《松花江上》《在太行山上》《保卫黄河》《没有共产党就没有新中国》，一首首诞生于抗战烽火中的经典歌曲连唱，让大家重温中华民族那段艰苦卓绝、气壮山河的峥嵘岁月。
8时55分，习近平等中外领导人来到天安门城楼主席台，全场爆发出雷鸣般的掌声。
电子屏幕上出现钟摆的画面。随着钟摆，1945、1955、1965……2025的年份数字依次显现。9时整，报时钟声响起，纪念大会开始。
全体肃立，80响礼炮震彻云霄，国旗护卫队官兵护卫着五星红旗，迈着矫健的步伐，从人民英雄纪念碑行进至广场北侧升旗区。中国人民解放军联合军乐团奏响雄壮的《义勇军进行曲》，全场齐声高唱中华人民共和国国歌，鲜艳夺目的五星红旗冉冉升起，在天安门广场上空高高飘扬。
在热烈的掌声中，习近平发表重要讲话。他表示，今天，我们隆重集会，纪念中国人民抗日战争暨世界反法西斯战争胜利80周年，目的是铭记历史、缅怀先烈、珍爱和平、开创未来。
习近平代表中共中央、全国人大、国务院、全国政协、中央军委，向全国参加过抗日战争的老战士、老同志、爱国人士和抗日将领，向为中国人民抗日战争胜利作出重大贡献的海内外中华儿女致以崇高敬意，向支援和帮助过中国人民抵抗侵略的外国政府和国际友人表示衷心感谢，向参加今天大会的各国来宾表示热烈欢迎。
习近平指出，中国人民抗日战争是艰苦卓绝的伟大战争。在中国共产党倡导建立的抗日民族统一战线旗帜下，中国人民以铮铮铁骨战强敌、以血肉之躯筑长城，取得近代以来反抗外敌入侵的第一次完全胜利。中国人民抗日战争是世界反法西斯战争的重要组成部分，中国人民以巨大的民族牺牲，为拯救人类文明、保卫世界和平作出了重大贡献。历史警示我们，人类命运休戚与共，各个国家、各个民族只有平等相待、和睦相处、守望相助，才能维护共同安全，消弭战争根源，不让历史悲剧重演。
习近平强调，中华民族是不畏强暴、自立自强的伟大民族。当年，面对正义与邪恶、光明与黑暗、进步与反动的生死较量，中国人民同仇敌忾、奋起反抗，为国家生存而战，为民族复兴而战，为人类正义而战。今天，人类又面临和平还是战争、对话还是对抗、共赢还是零和的抉择。中国人民坚定站在历史正确一边、站在人类文明进步一边，坚持走和平发展道路，与各国人民携手构建人类命运共同体。
习近平指出，中国人民解放军始终是党和人民完全可以信赖的英雄部队。全军将士要忠实履行神圣职责，加快建设世界一流军队，坚决维护国家主权、统一、领土完整，为实现中华民族伟大复兴提供战略支撑，为世界和平与发展作出更大贡献。
习近平强调，新时代新征程，全国各族人民要在中国共产党坚强领导下，坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想、邓小平理论、“三个代表”重要思想、科学发展观，全面贯彻新时代中国特色社会主义思想，坚定不移走中国特色社会主义道路，传承和弘扬伟大抗战精神，踔厉奋发、勇毅前行，为以中国式现代化全面推进强国建设、民族复兴伟业而团结奋斗。
习近平最后强调，中华民族伟大复兴势不可挡！人类和平与发展的崇高事业必将胜利！
习近平讲话结束时，全场响起长时间热烈掌声。

在纪念中国人民抗日战争暨世界反法西斯战争胜利80周年大会上的讲话
（2025年9月3日，上午）
习近平
全国同胞们，
尊敬的各位国家元首、政府首脑和国际组织代表，
尊敬的各位来宾，
全体受阅将士们，
同志们、朋友们：
今天，我们隆重集会，纪念中国人民抗日战争暨世界反法西斯战争胜利80周年，共同铭记历史、缅怀先烈、珍爱和平、开创未来。
我代表中共中央、全国人大、国务院、全国政协、中央军委，向全国参加过抗日战争的老战士、老同志、爱国人士和抗日将领，向为中国人民抗日战争胜利作出重大贡献的海内外中华儿女，致以崇高敬意！向支援和帮助过中国人民抵抗侵略的外国政府和国际友人，表示衷心感谢！向参加今天大会的各国来宾，表示热烈欢迎！
同志们、朋友们！
中国人民抗日战争是艰苦卓绝的伟大战争。在中国共产党倡导建立的抗日民族统一战线旗帜下，中国人民以铮铮铁骨战强敌、以血肉之躯筑长城，取得近代以来反抗外敌入侵的第一次完全胜利。
中国人民抗日战争是世界反法西斯战争的重要组成部分，中国人民以巨大的民族牺牲，为拯救人类文明、保卫世界和平作出了重大贡献。
历史警示我们，人类命运休戚与共，各个国家、各个民族只有平等相待、和睦相处、守望相助，才能维护共同安全，消弭战争根源，不让历史悲剧重演！
同志们、朋友们！
中华民族是不畏强暴、自立自强的伟大民族。当年，面对正义与邪恶、光明与黑暗、进步与反动的生死较量，中国人民同仇敌忾、奋起反抗，为国家生存而战，为民族复兴而战，为人类正义而战。今天，人类又面临和平还是战争、对话还是对抗、共赢还是零和的抉择。中国人民坚定站在历史正确一边、站在人类文明进步一边，坚持走和平发展道路，与各国人民携手构建人类命运共同体。
中国人民解放军始终是党和人民完全可以信赖的英雄部队。全军将士要忠实履行神圣职责，加快建设世界一流军队，坚决维护国家主权、统一、领土完整，为实现中华民族伟大复兴提供战略支撑，为世界和平与发展作出更大贡献！
历史承载过去，也启迪未来。新时代新征程，全国各族人民要在中国共产党坚强领导下，坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想、邓小平理论、“三个代表”重要思想、科学发展观，全面贯彻新时代中国特色社会主义思想，坚定不移走中国特色社会主义道路，传承和弘扬伟大抗战精神，踔厉奋发、勇毅前行，为以中国式现代化全面推进强国建设、民族复兴伟业而团结奋斗！
中华民族伟大复兴势不可挡！人类和平与发展的崇高事业必将胜利！]]></content>

习近平指出，在我同拉赫蒙总统战略引领下，中塔合作不断取得新成果。中国已成为塔吉克斯坦第一大贸易伙伴，一系列合作项目取得新进展。作为全面战略合作伙伴，中方愿同塔方携手同心，构建中塔命运共同体。
习近平强调，中塔要加强发展战略对接，推动各领域合作。中方愿鼓励更多中国企业赴塔投资，支持双方拓展新能源汽车、数字经济、基础设施建设等领域合作，深化防灾减灾、医疗、文化、教育交流。双方要持续推进反恐合作，共同打击“三股势力”，维护好共同战略利益。要加强在多边事务中的协作，共同落实全球治理倡议，推动构建更加公正合理的全球治理体系。中塔两国都为第二次世界大战胜利付出了巨大牺牲，要坚决捍卫二战胜利成果，携手推进世界和平与发展的崇高事业。
拉赫蒙表示，塔方高度重视塔中关系，加强塔中合作符合两国共同利益。塔方坚定奉行一个中国原则，永远是中国可靠的合作伙伴。塔方愿在经贸、绿色经济、数字经济、基础设施建设等广泛领域同中方加强合作，欢迎中国企业赴塔投资兴业。中国积极发挥上海合作组织轮值主席国作用，推动上海合作组织进入发展新阶段，为地区和平稳定作出重要贡献。祝贺中国人民抗日战争胜利80周年，人类应当铭记历史、开创美好未来。习近平主席提出的全球治理倡议体现了世界级领袖的视野和担当，塔方完全支持，愿同中方共同推动落实，使国际治理更加合理、更加有效。
双方签署互联互通、绿色低碳、数字经济等领域多份双边合作文件。

习近平指出，中马是志同道合的好朋友，双方在国际风云变幻中守望相助，在现代化道路上携手同行，顺利开启中马关系新的“黄金50年”。今年4月，我对马来西亚进行国事访问，双方就构建高水平战略性中马命运共同体达成重要共识。中方愿同马方一道努力，推进中马命运共同体建设，更好造福两国人民，为促进地区和世界和平与发展作出贡献。
习近平强调，双方要突出双边关系“高水平、战略性”新定位，深化全方位战略协作，坚定支持彼此核心利益和重大关切。携手建设地区高质量发展合作高地，着力打造人工智能、新能源、半导体等新兴产业合作亮点，高水平建设好“两国双园”、东海岸铁路等重点项目。继续开展“儒伊文明对话”，拉紧人文相亲纽带。密切多边协同配合，推动构建更为紧密的中国－东盟命运共同体，携手捍卫国际公平正义，维护全球南方共同利益。
安瓦尔表示，习近平主席对马来西亚的国事访问非常成功，有力推动两国关系驶入快车道，马各界反响热烈。很荣幸来华出席纪念中国人民抗日战争暨世界反法西斯战争胜利80周年活动。习近平主席刚刚提出的全球治理倡议，直面全球治理面临的问题，既有先进的理念，又有切实的问题解决方案，对提高全球治理水平意义重大。马方珍视马中之间特殊的战略伙伴关系，愿不断深化各领域合作，为两国人民带来更多福祉。
